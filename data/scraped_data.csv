https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-intro/v/introduction-to-limits-hd	khanacademy	video	:00In this video, I want to familiarize youwith the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea.It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon.But despite being so super important,it's actually a really, really, really, really, really, reallysimple idea.So let me draw a function here, actually,let me define a function here, a kind of a simple function.So let's define f of x, let's say that f of xis going to be x minus 1 over x minus 1.And you might say, hey, Sal look,I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator.If I have something divided by itself,that would just be equal to 1.Can't I just simplify this to f of x equals 1?And I would say, well, you're almost true,the difference between f of x equals 1and this thing right over here, is that this thing can neverequal-- this thing is undefined when x is equal to 1.Because if you set, let me define it.Let me write it over here, if you have f of,sorry not f of 0, if you have f of 1, what happens.In the numerator, we get 1 minus 1,which is, let me just write it down, in the numerator,you get 0.And in the denominator, you get 1 minus 1, which is also 0.And so anything divided by 0, including 0 divided by 0,this is undefined.So you can make the simplification.You can say that this is you the same thing as f of x is equalto 1, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot beequal to 1.Now this and this are equivalent,both of these are going to be equal to 1for all other X's other than one, but at x equals 1,it becomes undefined.This is undefined and this one's undefined.So how would I graph this function.So let me graph it.So that, is my y is equal to f of x axis,y is equal to f of x axis, and then this over hereis my x-axis.And then let's say this is the point x is equal to 1.This over here would be x is equal to negative 1.This is y is equal to 1, right up there I could do negative 1.but that matter much relative to this function right over here.And let me graph it.So it's essentially for any x other than 1 fof x is going to be equal to 1.So it's going to be, look like this.It's going to look like this, except at 1.At 1 f of x is undefined.So I'm going to put a little bit of a gap rightover here, the circle to signify that this function is notdefined.We don't know what this function equals at 1.We never defined it.This definition of the function doesn't tell uswhat to do with 1.It's literally undefined, literally undefinedwhen x is equal to 1.So this is the function right over here.And so once again, if someone were to ask you what is f of 1,you go, and let's say that even though this was a functiondefinition, you'd go, OK x is equal to 1,oh wait there's a gap in my function over here.It is undefined.So let me write it again.It's kind of redundant, but I'll rewrite it f of 1 is undefined.But what if I were to ask you, whatis the function approaching as x equals 1.And now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit.So as x gets closer and closer to 1.So as we get closer and closer x isto 1, what is the function approaching.Well, this entire time, the function,what's a getting closer and closer to.On the left hand side, no matter how closeyou get to 1, as long as you're not at 1,you're actually at f of x is equal to 1.Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing.So you could say, and we'll get more and morefamiliar with this idea as we do more examples,that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit,as x approaches 1 of f of x is equal to, as we get closer,we can get unbelievably, we can get infinitely close to 1,as long as we're not at 1.And our function is going to be equal to 1,it's getting closer and closer and closer to 1.It's actually at 1 the entire time.So in this case, we could say the limitas x approaches 1 of f of x is 1.So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying,look what is a function approachingas x gets closer and closer to 1.Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve,just so that you have the general idea.So let's say that I have the functionf of x, let me just for the sake of variety,let me call it g of x.Let's say that we have g of x is equal to,I could define it this way, we could define it as x squared,when x does not equal, I don't know when x does not equal 2.And let's say that when x equals 2 it is equal to 1.So once again, a kind of an interestingfunction that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous,it has a discontinuity.Let me graph it.So this is my y equals f of x axis,this is my x-axis right over here.Let me draw x equals 2, x, let's say this is x equals 1,this is x equals 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2.And then let me draw, so everywhere except x equals 2,it's equal to x squared.So let me draw it like this.So it's going to be a parabola, looks something like this,let me draw a better version of the parabola.So it'll look something like this.Not the most beautifully drawn parabolain the history of drawing parabolas,but I think it'll give you the idea.I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully.It should be symmetric, let me redraw itbecause that's kind of ugly.And that's looking better.OK, all right, there you go.All right, now, this would be the graph of just x squared.But this can't be.It's not x squared when x is equal to 2.So once again, when x is equal to 2,we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here.So I'll draw a gap right over there, because when x equals 2the function is equal to 1.When x is equal to 2, so let's say that,and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that.So this, on the graph of f of x is equal to x squared,this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1,this would be 3.So when x is equal to 2, our function is equal to 1.So this is a bit of a bizarre function,but we can define it this way.You can define a function however you like to define it.And so notice, it's just like the graph of fof x is equal to x squared, except when you get to 2,it has this gap, because you don'tuse the f of x is equal to x squared when x is equal to 2.You use f of x-- or I should say gof x-- you use g of x is equal to 1.Have I been saying f of x?I apologize for that.You use g of x is equal to 1.So then then at 2, just at 2, just exactly at 2,it drops down to 1.And then it keeps going along the functiong of x is equal to, or I should say, along the functionx squared.So my question to you.So there's a couple of things, if Iwere to just evaluate the function g of 2.Well, you'd look at this definition,OK, when x equals 2, I use this situation right over here.And it tells me, it's going to be equal to 1.Let me ask a more interesting question.Or perhaps a more interesting question.What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g of x.Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking somethingpretty, pretty, pretty simple.It's saying as x gets closer and closer to 2, as you get closerand closer, and this isn't a rigorous definition,we'll do that in future videos.As x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g of x approaching?So if you get to 1.9, and then 1.999, and then 1.999999,and then 1.9999999, what is g of x approaching.Or if you were to go from the positive direction.If you were to say 2.1, what's g of 2.1,what's g of 2.01, what's g of 2.001, what is that approachingas we get closer and closer to it.And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph.As g gets closer and closer to 2,and if we were to follow along the graph,we see that we are approaching 4.Even though that's not where the function is,the function drops down to 1.The limit of g of x as x approaches 2 is equal to 4.And you could even do this numerically using a calculator,and let me do that, because I think that will be interesting.So let me get the calculator out,let me get my trusty TI-85 out.So here is my calculator, and you could numericallysay, OK, what's it going to approachas you approach x equals 2.So let's try 1.94, for x is equal to 1.9,you would use this top clause right over here.So you'd have 1.9 squared.And so you get 3.61, well what if you get even closer to 2,so 1.99, and once again, let me square that.Well now I'm at 3.96.What if I do 1.999, and I square that?I'm going to have 3.996.Notice I'm going closer, and closer,and closer to our point.And if I did, if I got really close,1.9999999999 squared, what am I going to get to.It's not actually going to be exactly 4,this calculator just rounded things up,but going to get to a number really, really, really, really,really, really, really, really, really close to 4.And we can do something from the positive direction too.And it actually has to be the same numberwhen we approach from the below what we're trying to approach,and above what we're trying to approach.So if we try to 2.1 squared, we get 4.4.If we do 2.let me go a couple of steps ahead,2.01, so this is much closer to 2 now, squared.Now we are getting much closer to 4.So the closer we get to 2, the closerit seems like we're getting to 4.So once again, that's a numeric wayof saying that the limit, as x approaches 2from either direction of g of x, even though right at 2,the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous.The limit as we're approaching 2,we're getting closer, and closer, and closer to 4.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/limits-from-graphs	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So we have the graph of Y equals f of xright over here and we want to figure outthree different limits and like alwayspause this video and see if you can figure it outon your own before we do it together.Alright now first let's think about what's the limitof f of x it's x approaches six.So as x, I'm gonna do this in a color you can see,as x approaches six from both sideswell as we approach six from the left hand side,from values less than six,it looks like our f of x is approaching oneand as we approach x equals six from the right hand sideit looks like our f of x is once again approaching oneand in order for this limit to exist,we need to be approaching the same valuefrom both the left and the right hand sideand so here at least graphically,so you never are sure with a graph but this isa pretty good estimate, it looks like we are approaching oneright over there, in a darker color.Now let's do this next one.The limit of f of x is x approaches fourso as we approach four from the left hand sidewhat is going on?Well as we approach four from the left hand sideit looks like our function, the value of our functionit looks like it is approaching three.Remember you can have a limit exist at an x valuewhere the function itself is not defined,the function , if you said after four, it's not definedbut it looks like when we approach it from the leftwhen we approach x equals four from the leftit looks like f is approaching threeand then we approach four from the right,once again, it looks like our function is approaching threeso here I would say, at least from what we can tellfrom the graph it looks like the limitof f of x is x approaches four is three,even though the function itself is not defined yet.Now let's think about the limit as x approaches two.So this is interesting the function is defined theref of two is two, let's see when we approachfrom the left hand side it looks like our functionis approaching the value of twobut when we approach from the right hand side,when we approach x equals two from the right hand side,our function is getting closer and closer to fiveit's not quite getting to five but as we go fromyou know 2.1 2.01 2.001 it looks like our functionthe value of our function's getting closer and closerto five and since we are approaching two different valuesfrom the left hand side and the right hand sideas x approached two from the left hand sideand the right hand side we would say that this limitdoes not exist so does not exist.Which is interesting.In this first case the function is defined at sixand the limit is equal to the value of the functionat x equals six, here the function was not definedat x equals four, but the limit does existhere the function is defined at f equals, x equals twobut the limit does not exist as we approach x equals twolet's do another function just to get more casesof looking at graphical limits.So here we have the graph of Y is equal to g of xand once again pause this video and have a go at itand see if you can figure out these limits graphically.So first we have the limit as x approaches fiveg of x so as we approach five from the left hand sideit looks like we are approaching this valuelet me just draw a straight Line that takes usso it looks like we're approaching this valueand as we approach five from the right hand sideit also looks like we are approaching that same value.And so this value, just eye balling it off of herelooks like it's about .4 so I'll say this limitdefinitely exists just when looking at a graphit's not that preciseso I would say it's approximately 0.4it might be 0.41 it might be 0.41456789we don't know exactly just looking at this graphbut it looks like a value roughly around there.Now let's think about the limit of g of xas x approaches seven so let's do the same exercise.What happens as we approach from the leftfrom values less than seven 6.9, 6.99, 6.999well it looks like the value of our functionis approaching two, it doesn't matterthat the actual function is defined g of seven is fivebut as we approach from the left,as x goes 6.9, 6.99 and so on,it looks like our value of our functionis approaching two, and as we approach x equals sevenfrom the right hand side it seems like the same thingis happening it seems like we are approaching twoand so I would say that this is going to be equal to twoand so once again, the function is defined thereand the limit exists there but the g of sevenis different than the value if the limit of g of xas x approaches seven.Now let's do one more.What's the limit as x approaches one.Well we'll do the same thing,from the left hand side, it looks like we're goingunbounded as x goes .9, 0.99, 0.999 and 0.9999it looks like we're just going unbounded towards infinityand as we approach from the right hand sideit looks like the same thing is happeningwe're going unbounded to infinity.So formally, sometimes informally people will sayoh it's approaching infinity or something like thatbut if we wanna be formal about what a limit meansin this context because it is unboundedwe would say that it does not exist.Does not exist.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/unbounded-limits	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So right over here,we have the graph of y is equal to one over x squared.And my question to you is what is the limitof one over x squared as x approaches zero?Pause this video, and see if you can figure that out.Well, when you try to figure it out,you immediately see something interestinghappening at x equals zero.The closer we get to zero from the left,you take one over x squared,it just gets larger and larger and larger.It doesn't approach some finite value.It's unbounded, has no bound.And the same thing is happeningas we approach from the right.As we get values closer and closer to zero from the right,we get larger and larger valuesfor one over x squared without bound.So terminology that folks will sometimes use,where they're both going in the same direction,but it's unbounded, is they'll say this limit is unbounded.In some context, you might hear teachers saythat this limit does not exist or,and it definitely does not exist if you're thinking aboutapproaching a finite value.In future videos, we'll start to introduce ideas of infinityand notations around limits and infinity,where we can get a little bit more specificabout what type of limit this is.But with that out of the way,let's look at another scenario.This right over here, you might recognizeas the graph of y is equal to one over x.So I'm going to ask you the same question.Pause this video, and think aboutwhat's the limit of one over x as x approaches zero?Pause this video, and figure it out.All right, so here, when we approach from the left,we get more and more and more negative values.While we, when we approach from the right,we're getting more and more positive values.So in this situation,where we're not getting unbounded in the same direction,the previous example, we were both,we were being unbounded in the positive direction.But here, on the, from the left,we're getting unbounded in the negative direction.While from the right, we're getting unboundedin the positive direction.And so when you're thinking about the limitas you approach a point, if it's not even approachingthe same value or even the same direction,you would just clearly say that this limit does not exist,doesnotexist.So this is a situation, where you would not even saythat this is an unbounded limitor that the limit is unbounded.Because you're going in two different directions when you approach from the right and when you approach from the left,you would just clearly say does not exist.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/one-sided-limits-from-graphs	khanacademy	video	:00So if we were to ask ourselves, whatis the value of our function approaching--as we approach x equals 2 from values less than x equals 2.So as you imagine, as we approach x equals 2--So x equals 1, x equals 1.5, x equals 1.9, x equals 1.999,x equals 1.99999999.What is f of x approaching?And we see that f of x seems to be approachingthis value right over here.It seems to be approaching 5.And so the way we would denote that isthe limit of f of x, as x approaches 2--and we're going to specify the direction-- as x approaches 2from the negative direction-- we putthe negative as a superscript after the 2to denote the direction that we're approaching.This is not a negative 2.We're approaching 2 from the negative direction.We're approaching 2 from values less than 2.We're getting closer and closer to 2, but from below-- 1.9,1.99, 1.99999 .As x gets closer and closer from those values,what is f of x approaching?And we see here that it is approaching 5.But what if we were asked the natural other question-- Whatis the limit of f of x as x approaches 2from values greater than 2?So this is a little superscript positive right over here.So now we're going to approach x equals 2,but we're going to approach it from this direction--x equals 3, x equals 2.5, x equals 2.1, x equals 2.01,x equals 2.0001.And we're going to get closer and closer to 2,but we're coming from values that are larger than 2.So here, when x equals 3, f of x is here.When x equals 2.5, f of x is here.When x equals 2.01, f of x looks like it's right over here.So in this situation, we're getting closer and closerto f of x equaling 1.It never does quite equal that.It actually then just has a jump discontinuity.This seems to be the limiting value when we approach whenwe approach 2 from values greater than 2.So this right over here is equal to 1.And so when we think about limits in general,the only way that a limit at 2 will actually existis if both of these one-sided limitsare actually the same thing.In this situation, they aren't.As we approach 2 from values below 2,the function seems to be approaching 5.And as we approach 2 from values above 2,the function seems to be approaching 1.So in this case, the limit-- let me write this down--the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the negative direction, does notequal the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the positive direction.And since this is the case-- that they're not equal--the limit does not exist.The limit as x approaches 2 in generalof f of x-- so the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2,does not exist.In order for it to have existed, these two thingswould have had to have been equal to each other.For example, if someone were to say,what is the limit of f of x as x approaches 4?Well, then we could think about the two one-sided limits--the one-sided limit from below and the one-sided limitfrom above.So we could say, well, let's see.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 4 from below-- solet me draw that.So what we care about-- x equals 4.As x equals 4 from below--So when x equals 3, we're here where f of 3is negative 2. f of 3.5 seems to be right over here.f of 3.9 seems to be right over here. f of 3.999--we're getting closer and closer to our function equalingnegative 5.So the limit as we approach 4 from below--this one-sided limit from the left,we could say-- this is going to be equal to negative 5.And if we were to ask ourselves the limit of fof x, as x approaches 4 from the right,from values larger than 4, well, same exercise.f of 5 gets us here.f of 4.5 seems right around here.f of 4.1 seems right about here. f of 4.01seems right around here.And even f of 4 is actually defined,but we're getting closer and closer to it.And we see, once again, we are approaching 5.Even if f of 4 was not defined on either side,we would be approaching negative 5.So this is also approaching negative 5.And since the limit from the left-hand sideis equal to the limit from the right-hand side,we can say-- so these two things are equal.And because these two things are equal,we know that the limit of f of x, as x approaches 4,is equal to 5.Let's look at a few more examples.So let's ask ourselves the limit of f of x-- now,this is our new f of x depicted here-- as x approaches 8.And let's approach 8 from the left.As x approaches 8 from values less than 8.So what's this going to be equal to?And I encourage you to pause the video to try to figure it outyourself.So x is getting closer and closer to 8.So if x is 7, f of 7 is here.If x is 7.5, f of 7.5 is here.So it looks like our value of f of xis getting closer and closer and closer to 3.So it looks like the limit of f of x, as x approaches 8from the negative side, is equal to 3.What about from the positive side?What about the limit of f of x as xapproaches 8 from the positive directionor from the right side?Well, here we see as x is 9, this is our f of x.As x is 8.5, this is our f of 8.5.It seems like we're approaching f of x equaling 1.So notice, these two limits are different.So the non-one-sided limit, or the two-sided limit,does not exist at f of x or as we approach 8.So let me write that down.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 8--because these two things are not the same value--this does not exist.Let's do one more example.And here they're actually asking us a question.The function f is graphed below.What appears to be the value of the one-sided limit, the limitof f of x-- this is f of x-- as x approaches negative 2from the negative direction?So this is the negative 2 from the negative direction.So we care what happens as x approaches negative 2.We see f of x is actually undefined right over there.But let's see what happens as we approachfrom the negative direction, or as we approachfrom values less than negative 2,or as we approach from the left.As we approach from the left, f of negative 4is right over here.So this is f of negative 4.f of negative 3 is right over here.f of negative 2.5 seems to be right over here.We seem to be getting closer and closerto f of x being equal to 4, at least visually.So I would say that it looks-- at least,graphically-- the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the negative direction, is equal to 4.Now, if we also asked ourselves the limitof f of x, as x approaches negative 2from the positive direction, we would get a similar result.Now, we're going to approach from whenx is 0, f of x seems to be right over here.When x is 1, f of x is right over here.When x is negative 1, f of x is there.When x is negative 1.9, f of x seems to be right over here.So once again, we seem to be getting closer and closer to 4.Because the left-handed limit and the right-handed limitare the same value.Because both one-sided limits are approaching the same thing,we can say that the limit of f of x, as x approachesnegative 2-- and this is from both directions.Since from both directions, we get the same limiting value,we can say that the limit exists there.And it is equal to 4.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/connecting-limits-and-graphical-behavior	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So we have the graphof y is equal to g of x right over here.And I wanna think about what is the limitas x approaches fiveof g of x?Well we've done this multiple times.Let's think about what g of x approachesas x approaches five from the left.g of x is approaching negative six.As x approaches five from the right,g of x looks like it's approaching negative six.So a reasonable estimate based on looking at this graphis that as x approaches five,g of x is approaching negative six.And it's worth notingthat that's not what g of five is.g of five is a different value.But the whole point of this videois to appreciate all that a limit does.A limit only describes the behavior of a functionas it approaches a point.It doesn't tell us exactly what's happening at that point,what g of five is,and it doesn't tell us muchabout the rest of the function,about the rest of the graph.For example, I could construct many different functionsfor which the limit as x approaches fiveis equal to negative six,and they would look very different from g of x.For example, I could say the limit off of xas x approaches fiveis equal to negative six,and I can construct an f of x that does thisthat looks very different than g of x.In fact if you're up for it,pause this video and see if you can so the same,if you have some graph paper, or even just sketch it.Well the key thing is that the behavior of the functionas x approaches five from both sides,from the left and the right,it has to be approaching negative six.So for example,a function that looks like this,so let me draw f of x,an f of x that looks like this,and is even defined right over there,and then does something like this.That would work.As we approach from the left,we're approaching negative six.As we approach from the right,we approaching negative six.You could have a functionlike this, let's say the limit,let's call it h of x,as x approaches fiveis equal to negative six.You could have a function like this,maybe it's defined up to there,then it's you have a circle there,and then it keeps going.Maybe it's not defined at all for any of these values,and then maybe down hereit is defined for all x values greater than or equal to fourand it just goes right through negative six.So notice,all of these,all of these functions as x approaches five,they all have the limit definedand it's equal to negative six,but these functions all look very very very different.Now another thing to appreciate isfor a given function,and let me delete these.Oftentimes we're asked to find the limitsas x approaches some type of an interesting value.So for example,x approaches five,five is interesting right over herebecause we have this point discontinuity.But you could take the limiton an infinite number of pointsfor this function right over here.You could say the limitof g of xas x approaches,not x equals, as x approaches,one, what would that be?Pause the video and try to figure it out.Well let's see,as x approaches one from the left-hand side,it looks like we are approaching this value here.And as x approaches one from the right-hand side,it looks like we are approaching that value there.So that would be equal to g of one.That is equal to g of onebased on that would be a reasonable,that's a reasonable conclusion to makelooking at this graph.And if we were to estimate that g of one is,looks like it's approximately negative 5.1or 5.2, negative 5.1.We could find the limitof g of xas x approaches pi.So pi is right around there.As x approaches pi from the left,we're approaching that valuewhich just looks actually pretty closeto the one we just thought about.As we approach from the right,we're approaching that value.And once again in this case,this is gonna be equal to g of pi.We don't have any interesting discontinuities thereor anything like that.So there's two big takeaways here.You can construct many different functionsthat would have the same limit at a point,and for a given function,you can take the limit at many different points,in fact an infinite number of different points.And it's important to point that out,no pun intended,because oftentimes we get used to seeing limitsonly at points where somethingstrange seems to be happening.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/determining-which-limit-statements-are-true	khanacademy	video	:00So we have a function, f of x, graphed right over here.And then we have a bunch of statementsabout the limit of f of x, as x approaches different values.And what I want to do is figure out which of these statementsare true and which of these are false.So let's look at this first statement.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,is equal to 0.So is this true or false?So let's look at it.So we're talking about as x approaches 1from the positive direction, so for values greater than 1.So as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,what is f of x?Well, when x is, let's say 1 and 1/2, f of x is up here,as x gets closer and closer to 1, f of x stays right at 1.So as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,it looks like the limit of f of x as x approaches 1from the positive direction isn't 0.It looks like it is 1.So this is not true.This would be true if instead of sayingfrom the positive direction, we saidfrom the negative direction.From the negative direction, the value of the functionreally does look like it is approaching 0.For approaching 1 from the negative direction, whenx is right over here, this is f of x.When x is right over here, this is f of x.When x is right over here, this is f of x.And we see that the value of f of xseems to get closer and closer to 0.So this would only be true if theywere approaching from the negative direction.Next question.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 0 from the negative direction,is the same as limit of f of x as x approaches 0from the positive direction.Is this statement true?Well, let's look.Our function, f of x, as we approach 0from the negative direction-- I'musing a new color-- as we approach 0from the negative direction, so right over here,this is our value of f of x.Then as we get closer, this is our value of f of x.As we get even closer, this is our value of f of x.So it seems from the negative directionlike it is approaching positive 1.From the positive direction, when x is greater than 0,let's try it out.So if, say, x is 1/2, this is our f of x.If x is, let's say, 1/4, this is our f of x.If x is just barely larger than 0, this is our f of x.So it also seems to be approachingf of x is equal to 1.So this looks true.They both seem to be approaching the limit of 1.The limit here is 1.So this is absolutely true.Now let's look at this statement.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 0from the negative direction, is equal to 1.Well, we've already thought about that.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 0from the negative direction, we seethat we're getting closer and closer to 1.As x gets closer and closer to 0, f of xgets closer and closer to 1.So this is also true.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 0 exists.Well, it definitely exists.We've already established that it's equal to 1.So that's true.Now the limit of f of x as x approaches 1 exists,is that true?Well, we already saw that when we were approaching 1from the positive direction, the limitseems to be approaching 1.We get when x is 1 and 1/2, f of x is 1.When x is a little bit more than 1, it's 1.So it seems like we're getting closer and closer to 1.So let me write that down.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 1from the positive direction, is equal to 1.And now what's the limit of f of x as x approaches 1from the negative direction?Well, here, this is our f of x.Here, this is our f of x.It seems like our f of x is getting closer and closer to 0,when we approach 1 from values less than 1.So over here it equals 0.So if the limit from the right-hand sideis a different value than the limit from the left-hand side,then the limit does not exist.So this is not true.Now finally, the limit of f of x, as x approaches 1.5,is equal to 1.So right over here.So everything we've been dealing with so far,we've always looked at points of discontinuity,or points where maybe the function isn't quite defined.But here, this is kind of a plain vanilla point.When x is equal to 1.5, that's maybe right over here,this is f of 1.5.That right over there is the point,well, this is the value f of 1.5.We could say f of, we could see that f of 1.5 is equal to 1,that this right here is the point 1.5 comma 1.And if we approach it from the left-hand side,from values less than it, it's 1, the limit seems to be 1.When we approach from the right-hand side,the limit seems to be 1.So this is a pretty straightforward thing.The graph is continuous right there, and so really,if we just substitute at that point,or we just look at the graph, the limitis the value of the function there.You don't have to have a function be undefined in orderto find a limit there.So it is, indeed, the case that the limitof f of x, as x approaches 1.5, is equal to 1.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-tables/v/approximating-limit-from-table	khanacademy	video	:00- This video we're going to try to geta sense of what the limit as x approaches threeof x to the third minus three x squaredover five x minus 15is.Now when I say get a sense,we're gonna do that by seeing whatvalues for this expression we get as x getscloser and closer to three.Now one thing that you might wanna try out is,well what happens to this expressionwhen x is equal to three?Well then it's going to be three to the third powerminus three times three squared,over five times threeminus 15.So at x equals three, this expression's gonna be,let's see in the numerator you have 27 minus 27, zero.Over 15 minus 15, over zero.So this expression is actually not definedat x equals three.We get this indeterminate form,we get zero over zero.But let's see, even though the function,or even though the expression is not defined,let's see if we can get a sense of what the limit might be.And to do that, I'm gonna set up a table.So let me set up a table here.And actually I wanna set up two tables.So this is x and this is x to the thirdminus three x squaredoverfive xminus15.And actually, I'm gonna do that again.And I'll tell you why in a second.So this is gonna be x and this is x to the thirdminus three x squaredoverfive x minus 15.The reason why I set up two tables,I didn't have to do two tables,I could have done it all in one table,but hopefully this will make ita little bit more intuitive what I'm trying to do.Is on this left table, I'm gonna, let's try out x valuesthat get closer and closer to three from the left.From values that are less than three.So for example, you can go to two point nineand figure out what the expression equalswhen x is two point nine.But then we can try to get even a little bit closerthan that, we could go to two point nine nine.And then we could go even closer than that.We could go to two point nine nine nine.And so one way to think about it hereis as we try to figure out what this expression equalsas we get closer and closer to three,we're trying to approximate the limit from the left.So limitfromthe left.Now why do I say the left?Well if you think about this on a coordinate plane,these are the x values that are to the left of three,but we're getting closer and closer and closer.We're moving to the right,but these are the x values thatare on the left side of three, they're less than three.But we also, in order for the limit to exist,we have to be approaching the same thing from both sides.From both the left and the right.So we could also try to approximatethe limit fromthe right.And so what values would those be?Well those would be, those would be x valueslarger than three.So we could say three point one,but then we might wanna get a little bit closer,we could go three point zero one.But then we might wanna get even closer to three.Three point zero zeroone.And every time we get closer and closer to three,we're gonna get a better approximation for,or we're gonna get a better senseof what we are actually approaching.So let's get a calculator out and do this.And you could keep going, two nine nine nine nine nine.Three point zero zero zero zero one.Now one key idea here to point out,before I even calculate what these are going to be,sometimes when people say the limit from both sides,or the limit from the left or the limit from the right,they imagine that the limit from the leftis negative values and the limit from the rightare positive values.But as you can see here, the limit from the leftare to the left of the x value that you're tryingto find the limit at.So these aren't negative values,these are just approaching the threeright over here from values less than three.This is approaching the threefrom values larger than three.So now let's fill out this table,and I'm speeding up my work so that you don'thave to sit through me typing everythinginto a calculator.So based on what we're seeing here,I would make the estimate that this lookslike it's approaching one point eight.So is this equal to one point eight?As I said, in the future, we're gonnabe able to find this out exactly.But if you're not sure about thisyou could try an even closer and closer and closer value.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-tables/v/estimating-limit-from-table	khanacademy	video	:00- [Teacher] The function g is defined over the real numbers.This table gives select values of g.What is a reasonable estimate for the limitis x approaches five of g of x?So pause this video, look at this table.It gives us the x values as we approach fivefrom values less than five and as we approach fivefrom values greater than fiveit even tells us what g of x is at x equals five.And so, given that, what is a reasonable estimatefor this limit?Alright now let's work through this together.So let's think about what g of x seems to be approachingas x approaches five from values less than five.Let's see at four is it 3.37, 4.9? It's a little higher.Is it 3.5, 4.99? Is it 3.66?4.999; so very close to five.We're only a thousandth away, we're at 3.68.But then at five all of a suddenit looks like we're kind of jumping to 6.37.And once again, I'm making an inference here.I don't, these are just sample pointsof this function, we don't know exactlywhat the function is.But then if we approach five from values greater than five.At six we're at 3.97; at 5.1 we're at 3.84.5.01; 3.7; 5.001;we're at 3.68.So a thousandth below five and a thousandth above fivewe're at 3.68, but then at fiveall of sudden we're at 6.37.So my most reasonable estimatewould be, well it look like we're approaching 3.68.When we're approaching from values less than five.And we're approaching 3.68 from valuesas we approach five from values greater than five.It doesn't matter that the value of five is 6.37.The limit would be 3.68 ora reasonable estimate for the limit would be 3.68.And this is probably the most tempting distractor herebecause if you were to just substitute five;what is g of five?It tells us 6.37, but the limit does nothave to be what the actual function equals at that point.Let me draw what this might look like.So an example of this, so if this is five right over here,At the point five the value of my functionis 6.37, so let's say that this right over hereis 6.37, so that's the valueof my function right over there.So 6.37, but as we approach five,so that's four, actually let me spread out a little bit.This obviously is not drawing to scale.But as we approach five, so if this, that's 6.37;then at four, 3.37 is about hereand it looks like it's approaching 3.68.So 3.68, actually let me draw that.So 3.68 is gonna be roughly that.3.68 is gonna be roughly that.So the graph, the graph might look something like this.We can infer it looks like it's doing something like this.Where it's approaching 3.68 from values less than fiveand values greater than five, but right at five,our value is 6.37.I don't know for sure if this is what the graph look likeonce again, we're just getting some sample points.But this would be a reasonable inference.And so you can see, our limit.We are approaching 3.68, even though the valueof the function is something different.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-tables/v/one-sided-limits-from-tables	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] The function F is definedover the real numbers.This table gives select values of F.We have our table here.For these X values, it gives the corresponding F of X.What is a reasonable estimate for the limit of F of Xas X approaches one from the left?So pause this videoand see if you can figure it out on your own.Alright, now let's work through this together.So the first thing that is really important to realizeis when you see this X approaches oneand you see this little negative superscript here,this does not mean approaching negative one,so this does not mean negative one.Sometimes your brain just sees a oneand that little negative sign there,and you're like oh, this must be a weird wayof writing negative one,or you don't even think about it,but it's not saying that.It's saying, this is saying,let me put a little arrow here,this is the limit of F of Xas X approaches one from the left,from the left.So from the left, how do we know that?Well that's what that little negative tells us.It tells us we're approaching onefrom values less than one.If we were approaching one from the right,from values greater than one,that would be a positive sign right over there.So let's think about it.We want the limit as X approaches one from the left,and lucky for us on this table,we have some values of X approaching one from the left.0.9, which is already pretty close to one,then we get even closer to one from the left.Notice, these are all less than one,but they're getting closer and closer to one.And so what we really wanna look atis what does F of X approachas X is getting closer and closer to one,from the left, from the left.And a key realization here is,if we're thinking about general limits,not just from one direction,then we might wanna look atfrom the left and from the right,but they're asking us only from the left,so we should only be looking at these valuesright over here.In fact, we shouldn't even let the value of F of Xat X equal one confuse us.Sometimes and oftentimes,the limit is approaching a different valuethan the value of the function at that point.So let's look at this.At 0.9, F of X is 2.5.When we get even closer to one from the left,we go to 2.1.When we get even closer to one from the left,we're getting even closer to two.So a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches onefrom the left of F of X,it looks like F of X right over hereis approaching two.We don't know for sure,that's why they're saying, what is a reasonable estimate.It might be approaching 2.01or it might be approaching 1.999.On Khan Academy these will often bemultiple choice questions,so you have to pick the most reasonable one,it would not be fair if they gave a 1.999 as a choiceand 2.01,but if you were saying,hey, maybe this was approaching a whole number,then two could be a reasonable estimate right over here.Although it doesn't have to be two,it could be 2.01258,it might be what it is actually approaching.So let's try another example here.Here it does look like there's a reasonable estimatefor the limit as we approach this value from the left.So now, it says the function Fis defined over the real numbers.This table gives select values of F,similar to the last question.What is a reasonable estimate for the limitas X approaches negative two from the left?So this is confusing.You see these two negative signs.This first negative sign tells uswe're approaching negative two.We wanna say, what happens we're approaching negative two,and we're gonna approach once again from the left.So lucky for us, they have values of Xthat are approaching negative two from the left,so this is X approaches negative two from the left,so that is happening right over here.So that's these values.So notice, this is negative 2.05,then we get even closer, negative 2.01,then we get even closer, negative 2.002,and these are from the leftbecause these are values less than negative two,but they're getting closer and closer to negative two.And so let's see,when we're a little bit further, F of X is negative 20,we get a little bit closer, it's negative 100,we get even a little bit closer, it goes to negative 500.So it would be reasonable, and we don't know for sure,this is just giving us a few sample pointsfor this function,but if we follow this trend,as we get closer and closer to negative two,without getting there,it looks like this is getting unbounded.It looks like it's becoming infinitely negative.And so technically, it looks like this is,I would write this is unbounded,and so if this was a multiple choice question,technically you would say the limitas X approaches negative two from the left does not exist,does not exist.If someone asked the other question,if they said, what is the limitas X approaches negative twofrom the right of F of X,well then you would say,alright, well here are values approaching negative twofrom the right,so this is X approaching negative two from the right,right over here.And remember, when you're looking at a limit,sometimes it might be distractingto look at the actual value of the function at that point,so we wanna think about what is the valueof the function approaching,as your X is approaching that value,as X is approaching, in this case, negative two,from the right.So as we're getting closer and closerto negative two from values larger than negative two,it looks like F of X is getting closer and closerto negative four,which is F of negative two,but that actually seems like a reasonable estimate.Once again, we don't know absolutely for sure,just by sampling some points,but this would be a reasonable estimate.And in general, if you are approaching different valuesfrom the left than from the right,then you would say, a that point,the limit of your function does not exist,and we have seen that in other videos.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-formal-definition-of-limits-epsilon-delta/v/limit-intuition-review	khanacademy	video	:00Let's review our intuition of what a limit even is.So let me draw some axes here.So let's say this is my y-axis, so try to draw a vertical line.So that right over there is my y-axis.And then let's say this is my x-axis.I'll focus on the first quadrant,although I don't have to.So let's say this right over here is my x-axis.And then let me draw a function.So let's say my function looks something like that,could look like anything, but that seems suitable.So this is the function y is equal to f of x.And just for the sake of conceptual understanding,I'm going to say it's not defined at a point.I didn't have to do this.You can find the limit as x approaches a point wherethe function actually is defined,but it becomes that much more interesting, at least for me,or you start to understand why a limit might be relevantwhere a function is not defined at some point.So the way I've drawn it, this functionis not defined when x is equal to c.Now, the way that we've thought about a limitis what does f of x approach as x approaches c?So let's think about that a little bit.When x is a reasonable bit lower than c,f of x, for our function that we just drew, is right over here.That's what f of x is going to be equal. y is equal to f of x.When x gets a little bit closer, then our f of xis right over there.When x gets even closer, maybe really almostat c, but not quite at c, then our f of x is right over here.And the way we see it, we see that our f of xseems to be-- as x gets closer and closer to cit looks like our f of x is getting closerand closer to some value right over there.Maybe I'll draw it with a more solid line.And that was actually only the casewhen x was getting closer to c from the left,from values of x less than c.But what happens as we get closer and closerto c from values of x that are larger than c?Well, when x is over here, f of x is right over here.And so that's what f of x is, is right over there.When x gets a little bit closer to c, our f of xis right over there.When x is just very slightly larger than c, then our f of xis right over there.And you see, once again, it seemsto be approaching that same value.And we call that value, that value that f of xseems to be approaching as x approachesc, we call that value L, or the limit.And so the way we would denote itis we would call that the limit.We don't have to call it L all the time,but it is referred to as the limit.And the way that we would kind ofwrite that mathematically is we would say the limit of fof x as x approaches c is equal to L.And this is a fine conceptual understanding of limits,and it really will take you pretty far,and you're ready to progress and start thinkingabout taking a lot of limits.But this isn't a very mathematically-rigorousdefinition of limits.And so this sets us up for the intuition.In the next few videos, we will introducea mathematically-rigorous definitionof limits that will allow us to do thingslike prove that the limit as x approaches ctruly is equal to L.

So let'ssay that this means that you can get f of x as closeto L as you want.I'll put that in quotes right over here,because it's kind of a little looseygoosey as how close is that.But as close as you want by gettingx sufficiently close to c.So another way of saying this is, if you tell me, hey,I want to get my f of x to be within 0.5 of this limit.Then you're telling me if this limit is actually true,you should be able to hand me a value around c.That if x is within that range, then f of xis definitely going to be as close to L as I desire.So let me draw that out to make it a little bit clearer.And I'm going to zoom in.I'm going to draw another diagram.So let's say that this right over here is my y-axis.And I'm going to zoom in.I'm going to draw a slightly different function, just so wecan really focus on what's going on around here.The range is around c, and the range is around L. So that's x.This right over here is y.Let's say that this is c.And let's just zoom in on our function.So let's say our function looks, is doing something like,let's say it does something like, let's see, Idon't want it to be defined at c.At least just for the-- it could be.You can always find a limit even where is defined.But let's say our function looks something like that.And it can have a little kink in it, the way I drew it.So it looks something like this.It's undefined.Let me draw it a little bit different.So it is undefined when x is equal to c.So this is the point where there's a hole.It is undefined when x is equal to c.So it even has a little kink in it, just like that.And what we want to do is prove that the limit,as x, the limit of f of x-- and let me make it clear,this is the graph of y is equal to fof x-- we want to get an idea for what this definition issaying.If we're claiming that the limit of f of x, as x approaches c,is L.So conceptually, we get the gist already.We already get the gist that this right over here is L.But what is this definition saying?Well, it's saying that you can get f of x as closeto L as you want.So if you tell someone, I want to getf of x within a certain range of L,then if this limit is actually true,if the limit of f of x as x approaches creally is equal to L, then they shouldbe able to find a range around c.That as long as x is around that range,your f of x is going to be in the range that you want.So let me actually go through that exercise.It really is a little bit like a game.So someone comes up to you and says, well, OK.I don't necessarily believe that you'reclaiming the limit of f of x as x approaches c is equal to L.I'm not really sure if that's the case.But I agree with this definition.So I want to get within 0.5.I want to get f of x within 0.5 of L. So this right over herewould be L plus 0.5.And this right over here is L minus 0.5.And then you say, fine.I'm going to give you a range around c,that if you take any x within that range, your f of xis always going to fall in this range that you care about.And so you look at this-- and obviously we haven't explicitlydefined this function.But you can even eyeball it, the way this function is defined.It won't be that easy for all functions.But you look at it like this.And you say that this value, just the wayit's drawn right over here, let'ssay that this is c minus 0.25.And let's say that this value right over here is c plus 0.25.And so you tell them, look, as longas you get x within 0.25 of c, so as longas your x's are sitting someplace over here,the corresponding f of x is going to sit in the rangethat you care about.And you say, OK, fine.You won that round.Let me make it even tighter.Maybe instead of saying within the 0.5, I want to get withinis 0.05.And then you'd have to do this exercise again and findanother range.And in order for this to be true,you would have to be able to do this for any rangethat they give you.For any range around L that they give you,you have to be able to get f of x within that rangeby finding a range around c.That as long as x is that range around c,f of x is going to sit within that range.So I'll let you think about that a little bit.There's a lot to think about.But hopefully this made sense.We did it for the particular example of someonehands you the 0.5, I want f of x within the 0.5 of L,and you say, well, as long as x is within 0.25 of c,you're going to match it.You need to be able to do that for any rangethey give you around L. And then this limitwill definitely be true.So in the next video, we will now generalize that.And that will really bring us to the famous epsilon deltadefinition of limits.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-formal-definition-of-limits-epsilon-delta/v/epsilon-delta-definition-of-limits	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we tried to come upwith a somewhat rigorous definition of what a limit is,where we say when you say that the limit of fof x as x approaches C is equal L, you're really saying--and this is the somewhat rigorous definition--that you can get f of x as close as youwant to L by making x sufficiently close to C.So let's see if we can put a little bit of meat on it.So instead of saying as close as you want,let's call that some positive number epsilon.So I'm just going to use the Greek letter epsilon right overthere.So it really turns into a game.So this is the game.You tell me how close you want f of x to be to L.And you do this by giving me a positive number that we callepsilon, which is really how close you wantf of x to be to L. So you give a positive number epsilon.And epsilon is how close do you want to be?How close?So for example, if epsilon is 0.01,that says that you want f of x to be within 0.01 of epsilon.And so what I then do is I say well, OK.You've given me that epsilon.I'm going to find you another positive number which we'llcall delta-- the lowercase delta, the Greek letterdelta-- such that where if x is within delta of C,then f of x will be within epsilon of our limit.So let's see if these are really saying the same thing.In this yellow definition right over here,we said you can get f of x as closeas you want to L by making x sufficiently close to C.This second definition, which I kind ofmade as a little bit more of a game, is doing the same thing.Someone is saying how close they want f of x to be to Land the burden is then to find a delta where as longas x is within delta of C, then f of xwill be within epsilon of the limit.So that is doing it.It's saying look, if we are constraining x in such a waythat if x is in that range to C, thenf of x will be as close as you want.So let's make this a little bit clearerby diagramming right over here.You show up and you say well, I wantf of x to be within epsilon of our limit.This point right over here is our limit plus epsilon.And this right over here might be our limit minus epsilon.And you say, OK, sure.I think I can get your f of x within this range of our limit.And I can do that by defining a range around C.And I could visually look at this boundary.But I could even go narrower than that boundary.I could go right over here.Says OK, I meet your challenge.I will find another number delta.So this right over here is C plus delta.This right over here is C minus-- letme write this down-- is C minus delta.So I'll find you some delta so that if youtake any x in the range C minus delta to Cplus delta-- and maybe the function's not evendefined at C, so we think of onesthat maybe aren't C, but are getting very close.If you find any x in that range, f of thosex's are going to be as close as you want to your limit.They're going to be within the range L plus epsilon or Lminus epsilon.So what's another way of saying this?Another way of saying this is you give me an epsilon,then I will find you a delta.So let me write this in a little bit more math notation.So I'll write the same exact statementswith a little bit more math here.But it's the exact same thing.Let me write it this way.Given an epsilon greater than 0-- sothat's kind of the first part of the game--we can find a delta greater than 0, suchthat if x is within delta of C.So what's another way of saying that x is within delta of C?Well, one way you could say, well,what's the distance between x and Cis going to be less than delta.This statement is true for any x that's within delta of C.The difference between the two is going to be less than delta.So that if you pick an x that is in this range between Cminus delta and C plus delta, and theseare the x's that satisfy that right over here, then--and I'll do this in a new color-- thenthe distance between your f of x and your limit--and this is just the distance between the f of xand the limit, it's going to be less than epsilon.So all this is saying is, if the limit truly does exist,it truly is L, is if you give me any positive number epsilon,it could be super, super small one, we can find a delta.So we can define a range around Cso that if we take any x value thatis within delta of C, that's all this statementis saying that the distance between x and Cis less than delta.So it's within delta of C. So that'sthese points right over here.That f of those x's, the functionevaluated at those x's is going to be within the rangethat you are specifying.It's going to be within epsilon of our limit.The f of x, the difference between f of x, and your limitwill be less than epsilon.Your f of x is going to sit some place over there.So that's all the epsilon-delta definition is telling us.In the next video, we will prove that a limit existsby using this definition of limits.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-formal-definition-of-limits-epsilon-delta/v/proving-a-limit-using-epsilon-delta-definition	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we took our first lookat the epsilon-delta definition of limits, which essentiallysays if you claim that the limit of f of x as x approaches Cis equal to L, then that must mean by the definitionthat if you were given any positive epsilon that itessentially tells us how close we want f of x to be to L.We can always find a delta that'sgreater than 0, which is essentially telling usour distance from C such that if x is within delta of C,then f of x is going to be within epsilon of L.If we can find a delta for any epsilon,then we can say that this is indeedthe limit of f of x as x approaches C.Now, I know what you're thinking.This seems all very abstract.I want to somehow use this thing.And what we will do in this video is use itand to rigorously prove that a limit actually exists.So, right over here, I've defined a function, f of x.It's equal to 2x everywhere except for x equals 5.So it's 2x everywhere for all the other values of x,but when x is equal to 5, it's just equal to x.So I could have really just written 5.It's equal to 5 when x is equal to 5.It's equal to itself.And so we've drawn the graph here.Everywhere else, it looks just like 2x.At x is equal to 5, it's not along the line 2x.Instead, the function is defined to bethat point right over there.And if I were to ask you what is the limit of fof x as x approaches 5, you mightthink of it pretty intuitively.Well, let's see.The closer I get to 5, the closerf of x seems to be getting to 10.And so, you might fairly intuitively make the claimthat the limit of f of x as x approaches 5 reallyis equal to 10.It looks that way.But what we're going to do is usethe epsilon-delta definition to actually prove it.And the way that most of these proofs typically gois we define delta in the abstract.And then we essentially try to come up with a waythat given any epsilon, we can always come up with a delta.Or another way is we're going to tryto describe our delta as a function of epsilon,not to confuse you too much.But maybe I shouldn't use f again.But delta equals function of epsilonthat is defined for any positive epsilon.So you give me an epsilon, I justput into our little formula or little function box.And I will always get you a delta.And if I can do that for any epsilon that'll always give youa delta, where this is true, that if x is within delta of C,then the corresponding f of x is going to be within epsilonof L. Then the limit definitely exists.So let's try to do that.So let's think about being within delta of our C.So, let's think about this right over here is 5 plus delta,this is 5 minus delta.So that's our range we're going to think about.We're going to think about it in the abstract at first.And then we're going to try to come upwith a formula for delta in terms of epsilon.So how could we describe all of the x's that are in this rangebut not equal to 5 itself?Because we really care about the thingsthat are within delta of 5, but not necessarily equal to 5.This is just a strictly less than.They're within a range of C, but not equal to C.Well, that's going to be all of the x's that satisfy x minus 5is less than delta.That describes all of these x's right over here.And now, what we're going to do, and the way these proofstypically go, is we're going to tryto manipulate the left-hand side of the inequality,so it starts to look something like this,or it starts to look exactly like that.And as we do that, the right-hand sideof the inequality is going to be expressed in terms of delta.And then we can essentially say well, look.If the right-hand side is in termsof delta and the left-hand side looks justlike that, that really defines how we can express deltain terms of epsilon.If that doesn't make sense, bear with me.I'm about to do it.So, if we want x minus 5 to look a lot more like this, whenx is not equal to 5-- in all of this, this whole interval,x is not equal to 5-- f of x is equal to 2x,our proposed limit is equal to 10.So if we could somehow get this to be 2x minus 10,then we're in good shape.And the easiest way to do that isto multiply both sides of this inequality by 2.And 2 times the absolute value of something,that's the same thing as the absolute value of 2 timesthat thing.If I were to say 2 times the absolute value of a,that's the same thing as the absolute value of 2a.So on the left-hand side right over here,this is just going to be the absolute value of 2x minus 10.And it's going to be less than on the right-hand side,you just end up with a 2 delta.Now, what do we have here on the left-hand side?Well, this is f of x as long as x does not equal 5.And this is our limit.So we can rewrite this as f of x minus L is less than 2 delta.And this is for x does not equal 5.This is f of x, this literally is our limit.Now this is interesting.This statement right over here is almostexactly what we want right over here,except the right sides are just different.In terms of epsilon, this has it in terms of delta.So, how can we define delta so that 2 delta is essentiallygoing to be epsilon?Well, this is our chance.And this is where we're defining delta as a function of epsilon.We're going to make 2 delta equal epsilon.Or if you divide both sides by 2,we're going to make delta equal to epsilon over 2.Let me switch colors just to ease the monotony.If you make delta equal epsilon over 2,then this statement right over herebecomes the absolute value of f of x minus Lis less than, instead of 2 delta,it'll be less than 2 times epsilon over 2.It's just going to be less than epsilon.So this is the key.If someone gives you any positive number epsilonfor this function, as long as you make delta equal epsilonover 2, then any x within that range,that corresponding f of x is goingto be within epsilon of our limit.And remember, it has to be true for any positive epsilon.But you could see how the game could go.If someone gives you the epsilon,let's say they want to be within 0.5 of our limit.So our limit is up here, so our epsilon is 0.5.So it would literally be the range I want to be between 10plus epsilon would be 10.5.And then 10 minus epsilon would be 9.5.Well, we just came up with a formula.We just have to make delta equal to epsilonover 2, which is equal to 0.25.So that'll give us a range between 4.75 and 5.25.And as long as we pick an x between 4.75 and 5.25,but not x equals 5, the corresponding f of xwill be between 9.5 and 10.5.And so, you give me any epsilon, Ican just apply this formula right over hereto come up with the delta.This would apply for any real number.I mean, especially any positive number.For any epsilon you give me, I justget a delta defined this way, and then Ican go through this arc.If the absolute value of x minus 5 is less than delta,if delta is defined in this way, whichI could define for any epsilon, then itwill be the case that f of x willbe within epsilon of our limit.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limit-properties	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video is give youa bunch of properties of limits.And we're not going to prove it rigorously here.In order to have the rigorous proof of these properties,we need a rigorous definition of what a limit is.And we're not doing that in this tutorial,we'll do that in the tutorial on the epsilon deltadefinition of limits.But most of these should be fairly intuitive.And they are very helpful for simplifying limit problemsin the future.So let's say we know that the limit of some functionf of x, as x approaches c, is equal to capital L.And let's say that we also know that the limitof some other function, let's say g of x, as x approaches c,is equal to capital M.Now given that, what would be the limit of fof x plus g of x as x approaches c?Well-- and you could look at this visually,if you look at the graphs of two arbitrary functions,you would essentially just add those two functions--it'll be pretty clear that this is going to be equal to--and once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof,I'm just really giving you the properties here--this is going to be the limit of f of x as x approaches c,plus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.Which is equal to, well this right over hereis-- let me do that in that same color--this right here is just equal to L.It's going to be equal to L plus M. This right over hereis equal to M.Not too difficult.This is often called the sum rule, or the sum property,of limits.And we could come up with a very similar one with differences.The limit as x approaches c of f of x minus g of x,is just going to be L minus M. It's justthe limit of f of x as x approachesc, minus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.So it's just going to be L minus M.And we also often call it the differencerule, or the difference property, of limits.And these once again, are very, very, hopefully, reasonablyintuitive.Now what happens if you take the product of the functions?The limit of f of x times g of x as x approaches c.Well lucky for us, this is going to beequal to the limit of f of x as x approachesc, times the limit of g of x, as x approaches c.Lucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive propertyof limits.So in this case, this is just goingto be equal to, this is L times M. This is justgoing to be L times M. Same thing,if instead of having a function here, we had a constant.So if we just had the limit-- letme do it in that same color-- the limit of k timesf of x, as x approaches c, where k is just some constant.This is going to be the same thing as k times the limitof f of x as x approaches c.And that is just equal to L. So this whole thingsimplifies to k times L.And we can do the same thing with difference.This is often called the constant multiple property.We can do the same thing with differences.So if we have the limit as x approachesc of f of x divided by g of x.This is the exact same thing as the limitof f of x as x approaches c, dividedby the limit of g of x as x approaches c.Which is going to be equal to-- I think you get it now--this is going to be equal to L over M.And finally-- this is sometimes called the quotient property--finally we'll look at the exponent property.So if I have the limit of-- let mewrite it this way-- of f of x to some power.And actually, let me even write itas a fractional power, to the r over spower, where both r and s are integers, then the limit of fof x to the r over s power as x approaches c,is going to be the exact same thing as the limit of fof x as x approaches c raised to the r over s power.Once again, when r and s are both integers, and sis not equal to 0.Otherwise this exponent would not make much sense.And this is the same thing as L to the r over s power.So this is equal to L to the r over s power.So using these, we can actually findthe limit of many, many, many things.And what's neat about it is the property of limits kind ofare the things that you would naturally want to do.And if you graph some of these functions,it actually turns out to be quite intuitive.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limits-of-combined-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's find the limit of f of xtimes h of x as x approaches zero.All right, we have graphical depictionsof the graphs y equals f of x and y equals h of x.And we know, from our limit properties,that this is going to be the same thing as the limitas x approaches zero of f of xtimes,times the limitas x approaches zero ofh of x.And let's think about what each of these are.So let's first think about f of x right over here.So on f of x, as x approaches zero,notice the function itself isn't defined there.But we see when we approach from the left,we are approaching the,the function seems to be approaching the valueof negative one right over here.And as we approach from the right, the function seemsto be approaching the value of negative one.So the limit here,this limit here is negative one.As we approach from the left,we're approaching negative one.As we approach from the right, the value of the functionseems to be approaching negative one.Now what about h of x?Well, h of x we have down here.As x approaches zero,as x approaches zero,the function is defined at x equals zero.It looks like it is equal to one.And the limit is also equal to one.We can see that, as we approach it from the left,we are approaching one.As we approach from the right, we're approaching one.As we approach x equals zero from the left, we approach,the function approaches one.As we approach x equals zero from the right,the function itself is approaching one.And it makes sense that the function is defined there,is defined at x equals zero,and the limit as x approaches zerois equal to the same as the,is equal to the value of the function at that pointbecause this is a continuous function.So this is,this is one.And so negative one times oneis going to be equal to,is equal to negative one.So that is equal to negative one.Let's do one more.All right, so these are both,looks like continuous functions.So we have the limit as x approaches zero of h of xover g of x.So once again, using our limit properties,this is going to be the same thing as the limit of h of xas x approaches zeroover the limitof g of xas x approaches zero.Now what's the limit of h of x as x approaches zero?This is, let's see,as we approach zero from the left,as we approach x equals zero from the left,our function seems to be approaching four.And as we approach x equals zero from the right,our function seems to be approaching four.That's also what the valueof the function is at x equals zero.That makes sense because this is a continuous function.So the limit as we approach x equals zero should be the sameas the value of the function at x equals zero.So this top, this is going to be four.Now let's think about the limit of g of x as x equals,as x approaches zero.So from the left, it looks like, as x approaches zero,the value of the function is approaching zero.And as x approaches zero from the right,the value of the function is also approaching zero,which happens to also be,which also happens to be g of zero.G of zero is also zero.And that makes sense that the limit and the actual valueof the function at that point is the samebecause it's continuous.So this also is zero,but now we're in a strange situation.We have to take four and divide it by zero.So this limit will not exist'cause we can't take four and divide it by zero.So even though the limit of h of x is x equals,as x approaches zero existsand the limit of g of x as x approaches zero exists,we can't divide four by zero,so this whole entire limit does not exist,does not exist.And actually, if you were to plot h of x over g of x,if you were to plot that graph,you would see it even clearerthat that limit does not exist.You would actually be able to see it graphically.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limits-of-combined-functions-piecewise	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We are asked to findthese three different limits.I encourage you like always,pause this video and try to do it yourselfbefore we do it together.So when you do this first one,you might just try to find the limitas x approaches negative two of f of xand then the limit as x approaches negative two of g of xand then add those two limits together.But you will quickly find a problem,'cause when you find the limitas x approaches negative two of f of x,it looks as we are approaching negative twofrom the left, it looks like we're approaching one.As we approach x equals negative two from the right,it looks like we're approaching three.So it looks like the limitas x approaches negative two of f of x doesn't exist,and the same thing's true of g of x.If we approach from the left,it looks like we're approaching three.If we approach from the right,it looks like we're approaching one.But it turns out that this limit can still existas long as the limit as x approaches negative twofrom the left of the sum,f of x plus g of x,exists and is equal to the limitas x approaches negative two from the right of the sum,f of x plus g of x.So what are these things?Well, as we approach negative two from the left,f of x is approaching, looks like one,and g of x is approaching three.So it looks like we're approaching one and three.So it looks like this is approaching.The sum is going to approach four.And if we're coming from the right,f of x looks like it's approaching threeand g of x looks like it is approaching one.Once again, this is equal to four.And since the left and right handed limitsare approaching the same thing,we would say that this limit exists and it is equal to four.Now let's do this next example as x approaches one.Well, we'll do the exact same exercise.And once again, if you look at the individual limitsfor f of x from the left and the right as we approach one,this limit doesn't exist.But the limit as x approaches one of the sum might exist,so let's try that out.So the limit as x approaches onefrom the left hand side of f of x plus g of x,what is that going to be equal to?So f of x, as we approach one from the left,looks like this is approaching two.I'm just doing this for shorthand.And g of x, as we approach one from the left,it looks like it is approaching zero.So this will be approaching two plus zero, which is two.And then the limit,as x approaches one from the right hand sideof f of x plus g of x is going to be equal to.Well, for f of x as we're approaching onefrom the right hand side,looks like it's approaching negative one.And for g of x as we're approaching onefrom the the right hand side,looks like we're approaching zero again.Here it looks like we're approaching negative one.So the left and right hand limitsaren't approaching the same value,so this one does not exist.And then last but not least,x approaches one of f of x times g of x.So we'll do the same drill.Limit as x approaches one from the left hand sideof f of x times g of x.Well, here, and we can even use the values here.We see it was approaching one from the left.We are approaching two, so this is two.And when we're approaching one from the left here,we're approaching zero.We're gonna be approaching two times zero, which is zero.And then we approach from the right.X approaches one from the rightof f of x times g of x.Well, we already saw when we're approaching onefrom the right of f of x,we're approaching negative one.But g of x, approaching one from the right,is still approaching zero,so this is going to be zero again, so this limit exists.We get the same limitwhen we approach from the left and the right.It is equal to zero.So these are pretty interesting examples,because sometimes when you thinkthat the component limits don't existthat that means that the sumor the product might not exist,but this shows at least two exampleswhere that is not the case.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limits-of-composite-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Tutor] In this video, we're going to try to understandlimits of composite functions, or at least a wayof thinking about limits of composite functionsand in particular, we're gonna think about the casewhere we're trying to find the limit as x approaches a,of f of g of xand we're going to see under certain circumstances,this is going to be equal to f of the limit,the limit as x approaches a of g of xand what are those circumstances you are asking?Well, this is going to be trueif and only if two things are true,first of all, this limit needs to exist.So the limit as x approaches a of g of x needs to exist,so that needs to exist and then on top of that,the function f needs to be continuous at this pointand f continuous at L.So let's look at some examplesand see if we can apply this ideaor see if we can't apply it.So here I have two functions,that are graphically represented right over here,let me make sure I have enough space for themand what we see on the left-hand side is our function fand what we see on the right-hand side is our function g.So first let's figure out what is the limitas x approaches negative threeof f of g of x.Pause this video and see,first of all, does this theorem apply?And if it does apply, what is this limit?So the first thing we need to seeis does this theorem apply?So first of all, if we were to find the limitas x approaches negative three of g of x, what is that?Well, when we're approaching negative three from the right,it looks like our function is actually at threeand it looks like when we're approaching negative threefrom the left, it looks like our function is at three.So it looks like this limit is three,even though the value g of negative three is negative two,but it's a point discontinuity.As we approach it from either side,the value of the function is at three.So this thing is going to be three,so it exists, so we meet that first conditionand then the second question is is our function fcontinuous at this limit, continuous at three?So when x equals three, yeah, it looks like at that point,our function is definitely continuousand so we could say that this limitis going to be the same thingas this equals f of the limitas x approaches negative three of g of x,close the parenthesesand we know that this is equal to threeand we know that f of threeis going to be equal to negative one.So this met the conditions for this theoremand we were able to use the theoremto actually solve this limit.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/theorem-for-limits-of-composite-functions-when-conditions-aren-t-met	khanacademy	video	:00- [Tutor] In a previous video we used this theoremto evaluate certain types of composite functions.In this video we'll do a few more examples,that get a little bit more involved.So let's say we wanted to figure out the limitas x approaches zeroof f of g of x,f of g of x.First of all, pause this videoand think about whether this theorem even applies.Well, the first thing to think aboutis what is the limit as x approaches zero of g of xto see if we meet this first condition.So if we look at g of x, right over hereas x approaches zero from the left,it looks like g is approaching two,as x approaches zero from the right,it looks like g is approaching twoand so it looks like this is going to be equal to two.So that's a check.Now let's see the second condition,is f continuous at that limit at two.So when x is equal to two,it does not look like f is continuous.So we do not meet this second condition right over here,so we can't just directly apply this theorem.But just because you can't apply the theoremdoes not mean that the limit doesn't necessarily exist.For example, in this situationthe limit actually does exist.One way to think about it,when x approaches zero from the left,it looks like g is approaching two from aboveand so that's going to be the input into fand so if we are now approaching two from above hereas the input into f,it looks like our function is approaching zeroand then we can go the other way.If we are approaching zero from the right, right over here,it looks like the value of our functionis approaching two from below.Now if we approach two from below,it looks like the value of f is approaching zero.So in both of these scenarios,our value of our function f is approaching zero.So I wasn't able to use this theorem,but I am able to figure outthat this is going to be equal to zero.Now let me give you another example.Let's say we wanted to figure out the limitas x approaches twoof f of g of x.Pause this video,we'll first see if this theorem even applies.Well, we first wanna see what is the limitas x approaches two of g of x.When we look at approaching two from the left,it looks like g is approaching negative two.When we approach x equals two from the right,it looks like g is approaching zero.So our right and left hand limits are not the same here,so this thing does not exist, does not existand so we don't meet this condition right over here,so we can't apply the theorem.But as we've already seen,just because you can't apply the theoremdoes not mean that the limit does not exist.But if you like pondering things,I encourage you to see that this limit doesn't existby doing very similar analysisto the one that I did for our first example.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limits-of-composite-functions-internal-limit-doesn-t-exist	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] All right, let's geta little bit more practice taking limitsof composite functions.Here, we want to figure out what is the limitas x approaches negative one of g of h of x?The function g, we see it defined graphicallyhere on the left, and the function h,we see it defined graphically here on the right.Pause this video and have a go at this.All right, now your first temptation might be to say,all right, what is the limit as x approaches negative oneof h of x, and if that limit exists, then input that into g.If you take the limit as x approaches negative oneof h of x, you see that you have a different limitas you approach from the rightthan when you approach from the left.So your temptation might be to give up at this point,but what we'll do in this video is to realizethat this composite limit actually existseven though the limit as x approaches negative oneof h of x does not exist.How do we figure this out?Well, what we could do is take right-handedand left-handed limits.Let's first figure out what is the limitas x approaches negative one from the right hand sideof g of h of x?Well, to think about that, what is the limit of has x approaches negative one from the right hand side?As we approach negative one from the right hand side,it looks like h is approaching negative two.Another way to think about it is this is going to beequal to the limit as h of x approaches negative two,and what direction is it approaching negative two from?Well, it's approaching negative two from valueslarger than negative two.H of x is decreasing down to negative twoas x approaches negative one from the right.So it's approaching from values larger than negative twoof g of h of x.G of h of x.I'm color coding it to be able to keep track of things.This is analogous to saying what is the limit,if you think about it as x approaches negative twofrom the positive direction of g?Here, h is just the input into g.So the input into g is approaching negative twofrom above, from the right I should say,from values larger than negative two,and we can see that g is approaching three.So this right over here is going to be equal to three.Now, let's take the limit as x approaches negative onefrom the left of g of h of x.What we could do is first think about what is h approachingas x approaches negative one from the left?As x approaches negative one from the left,it looks like h is approaching negative three.We could say this is the limitas h of x is approaching negative three,and it is approaching negative threefrom values greater than negative three.H of x is approaching negative three from above,or we could say from values greater than negative three,and then of g of h of x.Another way to think about it,what is the limit as the input to gapproaches negative three from the right?As we approach negative three from the right,g is right here at three,so this is going to be equal to three again.So notice the right hand limit and the left hand limitin this case are both equal to three.So when the right hand and the left hand limitis equal to the same thing, we know that the limitis equal to that thing.This is a pretty cool example,because the limit of, you could say the internal functionright over here of h of x, did not exist,but the limit of the composite function still exists.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limits-of-composite-functions-external-limit-doesn-t-exist	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So over here I have two functionsthat have been visually or graphically defined.On the left here I have the graph of g of x,and on the right here I have the graph of h of x.And what I want to do is figure outwhat is the limit of g of h of x as x approaches one.Pause this video and see if you can figure that out.All right, now let's do this together.Now the first thing that you might try to say is,all right, let's just figure out first,the limit as x approaches one of h of x.And when you look at that, what is that going to be?Well, as we approach one from the left,it looks like h of x is approaching two.And as we approach from the right,it looks like h of x is approaching two.So it looks like this is just going to be two.And let me see, okay,well maybe we can then just input that into g.So what is g of two?Well, g of two is zero,but the limit doesn't seem defined.It looks like when we approach two from the right,we're approaching zero.And when we approach two from the left,we're approaching negative two.So maybe this limit doesn't exist.But if you're thinking that,we haven't fully thought through it,because what we could do is think about this limitin terms of both the left-handed and right-handed limits.So let's think of it this way.First, let's think about what is the limitas x approaches one from the left-hand side of g of h of x.All right, when you think about it this way,if we're approaching one from the left right over here,we see that we are approaching two from the left,I guess you could say, we're approaching two from below.And so the thing that we are inputting into g of xis approaching two from below.So the thing that we are inputting into gis approaching two from below.So if you approach two from below,right over here, what is g approaching?It looks like g is approaching negative two.So this looks like it is going to be equal to negative two,at least this left-handed limit.Now let's do a right-handed limit.What is the limit as x approaches onefrom the right hand of g of h of x?Well, we can do the same exercise.As we approach one from the right,it looks like h is approaching two from below,from values less than two.And so if we are approaching two from below,because remember,whatever h is outputting is the input into g.So if the thing that we're inputting g into gis approaching two from below,that means that g, once again,is going to be approaching negative two.So this is a really, really, really interesting case,where the limit of g of x as x approaches twodoes not exist.But because on h of x,when we approach from both the left and the right hand side,h is approaching two from below.We just have to think about the left-handed limitas we approach two from below or from the left on g,because in both situations, we are approaching negative two.And so that is going to be our limit.When the left-handed and the right-handed limitare the same, that is going to be your limit.It is equal to negative two.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-by-direct-substitution/v/limit-by-substitution	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So let's see if we can find the limitas X approaches negative one of six X squaredplus five X minus one.Now the first thing that might jump out at youis this right over here, this expression could be usedto define the graph of a parabola.And when you think about this, I'm not doinga rigorous proof here, parabola would looksomething like this and this would be anupward opening parabola, look something like this.It is a, this graph, visually, is continuous,you don't see any jumps or gaps in it.And in general,a quadratic like thisis going to be defined for all values of Xfor all real numbers, and it's going to be continuous,oh, for all real numbers.And so if something is continuous for all real numbers,well then the limit as X approaches some real numberis going to be the same thing, it's just a valuewithin the expression at that real number.So what am I saying, I'm just gonna say it another way,we know that some function is continuous,is continuous at some X value, at X equals Aif and only if, I'll write that as iff, or iff,if and only if the limitas X approaches A of F of Xis equal to F of,is equal to F of A.So I didn't do a rigorous proof here,but just, it's conceptually not a big jumpto say, okay, well this is, this is just a standardquadratic right over here,it's defined for all real numbers,and in fact it's continuous for all real numbers.And so we know that this expression,it could define a continuous function,so that means that the limit as X approaches Afor this expression is just the same thingas evaluating this expression at A.And in this case, our A is negative one.So all I have to to is evaluate this at negative one.This is going to be six times negative one squaredplus five times negative one minus one.So that's just one, this is negative five,so it's six minus five minus one,which is equal tozero.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-by-direct-substitution/v/undefined-limit-by-substitution	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can figure out the limitof x over natural log of x as x approaches one.And like always pause this video and see if you canfigure it out on your own.Well we know from out limit properties this is going tobe the same thing as the limitas x approaches one of x overoverthe limit,the limitas x approaches oneof the natural logof x.Now this top limit, the one I have in magenta,this is pretty straight forward,if we had the graph of y equals xthat would be continuous everywhereit's defined for all real numbers and it's continuousat all real numbers.So it's continuous to limit as x approaches one of x.It's just gonna be this evaluated x equals one.So this is just going to be one.We just put a one in for this x.For the numerator here we just evaluate to a one.And then the denominator,natural log of x is not defined for all x's,therefore it isn't continuous everywhere.But it is continuous at x equals one.And since it is continuous at x equals one,then the limit here is just gonna be the natural logevaluated at x equals one.So this is just going to be the natural logthe natural log of one.Which of courseis zero.E to the zero power is one.So this is all going to be equal tothis is going to be equal towe just evaluate itoneoveroneoverzero.And now we face a bit of a conundrum.One over zero is not defined.It is was zero over zero, we wouldn't necessarily bedone yet but it's indeterminate formas we will learn in the future there are tools we can applywhen we're trying to find limits and we evaluate itlike this and we get zero over zero.But one over zero.This is undefinedwhich tells us that this limitdoes not exist.So doesnotexist.Andwe are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-by-direct-substitution/v/limits-of-trigonometric-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois think about limits involving trigonometric functions.So let's just start with a fairly straightforward one.Let's find the limit as x approaches pi of sine of x.Pause the video and see if you can figure this out.Well, with both sine of x and cosine of x,they are defined for all real numbers,so their domain is all real numbers.You can put any real number in here for xand it will give you an output.It is defined.And they are also continuous over their entire domain,in fact, all of the trigonometric functions are continuousover their entire domain.And so for sine of x, because it's continuous,and is defined at sine of pi,we would say that this is the same thing assine of pi,and sine of pi, you might already know,is equal to zero.Now we could do a similar exercise with cosine of x,so if I were to say what's the limit as x approaches,I'll just take an arbitrary angle, x approaches pi over fourof cosine of x?Well once again,cosine of x is defined for all real numbers,x can be any real number.It's also continuous.So for cosine of x, this limit is just gonna be cosineof pi over four,and that is going to be equalto square root of two over two.This is one of those useful anglesto know the sine and cosine of.If you're thinking degrees, this is a 45 degree angle.And in general, if I'm dealing with a sine or a cosine,the limit as x approaches a of sine of xis equal to sine of a.Once again, this is going to be true for any a,any real number a.And I can make a similar statement about cosine of x.Limit as x approaches a of cosine of xis equal to cosine of a.Now, I've been saying it over and over,that's because both of their domains are all real numbers,they are defined for all real numbers that you put in,and they're continuous on their entire domain.But now, let's do slightly more involvedtrigonometric functions, or ones that aren't definedfor all real numbers, that their domains are constrainedjust a little bit more.So let's say if we were to take the limitas x approaches pi of tangent of x.What is this going to be equal to?Well, this is the same thing as the limitas x approaches pi.Tangent of x is sine of x over cosine of x.And so both of these are defined for piand so we could just substitute pi in.And we just wanna ensure that we don't get a zeroin the denominator, because that would make it undefined.So we get sine of piover cosine of pi which is equal to zero over negative one,which is completely fine.If it was negative one over zero, we'd be in trouble.But this is just gonna be equal to zero.So that works out.But if I were to ask you, what is the limitas x approaches pi over two of tangent of x?Pause the video and try to work that out.Well, think about it.This is the limit as x approaches pi over twoof sine of x over cosine of x.Now sine of pi over two is one,but cosine of pi over two is zero.So if you were to just substitute in,this would give you one over zero.And one way to think about it is pi over twois not in the domain of tangent of x.And so this limit actually turns out, it doesn't exist.In general, if we're dealing with the sine,cosine, tangent, or cosecant, secant, or cotangent,if we're taking a limit to a pointthat's in their domain, then the value of the limitis going to be the same thing as the valueof the function at that point.If you're taking a limit to a pointthat's not in their domain,there's a good chance that we're not going to have a limit.So here, there is no limit.And the way to do that is that pi over twois not in tangent of x's domain.If you were to graph tan of x, you would seea vertical asymptote at pi over two.Let's do one more of these.So let's say the limit as x approaches pi of cotangent of x,pause the video and see if you can figure outwhat that's going to be.Well, one way to think about it,cotangent of x is one over tangent of x,it's cosine of x over sine of x.This is a limit as x approaches piof this.And is pi in the domain of cotangent of x?Well, no, if you were just to substitute pi in,you're gonna get negative one over zero.And so that is not in the domain of cotangent of x.If you were to plot it, you would see a vertical asymptoteright over there.And so we have no limit.We have no limit.So once again, this is not in the domain of that,and so good chance that we have no limit.When the thing we're taking the limit tois in the domain of the trigonometric function,we're going to have a defined limit.And sine and cosine in particular are definedfor all real numbers and they're continuousover all real numbers.So you take the limit to anything for them,it's going to be defined and it's going to bethe value of the function at that point.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-by-direct-substitution/v/limits-of-piecewise-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's think a little bit aboutlimits of piecewise functions that are defined algebraicallylike our f of x right over here.Pause this video and see if you can figure outwhat these various limits would be,some of them are one-sided,and some of them are regular limits, or two-sided limits.Alright, let's start with this first one,the limit as x approaches four,from values larger than equaling four,so that's what that plus tells us.And so when x is greater than four,our f of x is equal to square root of x.So as we are approaching four from the right,we are really thinking about this part of the function.And so this is going to be equal to the square root offour, even though right at four,our f of x is equal to this,we are approaching from values greater than four,we're approaching from the right, so we would usethis part of our function definition,and so this is going to be equal to two.Now what about our limit of f of x,as we approach four from the left?Well then we would use this part of our function definition.And so this is going to be equal to four plus twoover four minus one,which is equal to 6 over three,which is equal to two.And so if we wanna say what is the limit of f of xas x approaches four, well this is a good scenario herebecause from both the left and the rightas we approach x equals four, we're approachingthe same value, and we know, that in order forthe two side limit to have a limit, you have to beapproaching the same thing from the right and the left.And we are, and so this is going to be equal to two.Now what's the limit as x approaches two of f of x?Well, as x approaches two, we are going to becompletely in this scenario right over here.Now interesting things do happen at x equals one here,our denominator goes to zero, but at x equals two,this part of the curve is gonna be continuousso we can just substitute the value, it's going to betwo plus two, over two minus one, which is four over one,which is equal to four.Let's do another example.So we have another piecewise function,and so let's pause our video and figure out these things.Alright, now let's do this together.So what's the limit as x approaches negative onefrom the right?So if we're approaching from the right,when we are greater than or equal to negative one,we are in this part of our piecewise function,and so we would say, this is going to approach,this is gonna be two, to the negative one power,which is equal to one half.What about if we're approaching from the left?Well, if we're approaching from the left,we're in this scenario right over here,we're to the left of x equals negative one,and so this is going to be equal to the sine,'cause we're in this case, for our piecewise function,of negative one plus one, which is the sine of zero,which is equal to zero.Now what's the two-sided limit as x approachesnegative one of g of x?Well we're approaching two different valuesas we approach from the right,and as we approach from the left.And if our one-sided limits aren't approachingthe same value, well then this limit does not exist.Does not exist.And what's the limit of g of x,as x approaches zero from the right?Well, if we're talking about approaching zerofrom the right, we are going to be in this caseright over here, zero is definitely in this interval,and over this interval, this right over hereis going to be continuous, and so we can just substitutex equals zero there, so it's gonna be two to the zero,which is, indeed, equal to one, and we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-by-direct-substitution/v/limit-at-a-point-of-discontinuity	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that f(x) is equal to the absolute value of x minus three over x minus threeand what I'm curious about is the limit of f(x) as x approaches threeand just from an inspection you can see that the function is not defined when x is equal to three - you get zero over zero: it's not definedSo to answer this question let's try to re-write the same exact function definition slightly differentlySo let's say f(x) is going to be equal to - and I'm going to think of two cases:I'm going to think of the case when x is greater than threeand when x is less than threeSo when x is - I'll do this in two different colors actuallyWhen x - I'll do it in green - that's not greenWhen x is greater than three...When x is greater than three, what does this function simplify to?Well, whatever I get up here, I'm just taking the..I'm going to get a positive value up here and then I'm...Well, if I take the absolute value it's going to be the exact same thing, so let me...For x is greater than three, this is going to be the exact same thing as x minus three over x minus threebecause if x is greater than three, the numerator's going to be positive, you take the absolute value of that, you're not going to change its valueso you get this right over here or, if we were to re-write it......if we were to re-write it, this is equal to, for x is greater than three, you're going to have f(x) is equal to onefor x is greater than threeSimilarly, let's think about what happens when x is less than threeWhen x is less than three, well, x minus three is going to be a negative numberWhen you take the absolute value of that, you're essentially negating itso it's going to be the negative of x minus three over x minus threeor if you were to simplify these two things, for any value as long as x doesn't equal threethis part right over her simplifies to one, so you are left with a negative onenegative one for x is less than threeI encourage you, if you don't believe what I just said, try it out with some numbersTry out some numbers:3.1, 3.001, 3.5, 4, 7Any number greater than three, you're going to get oneYou're going to get the same thing divided by the same thingand try values for x less than three:you're going to get negative one no matter what you trySo let's visualise this function nowSo, now you draw some axes...That's my x- axisand then this is my...This is my f(x) axis - y is equal to f(x)and what we care about is x is equal to threeso x is equal to one, two, three, four, fiveand we could keep going...and let's say this is positive one, two, so that's y is equal to onethis is y is equal to negative one and negative twoand we can keep going...So this way that we have re-written the functionis the exact same function as thiswe've just written [it] in a different wayand so what we're saying is...is we're...Our function is undefined at threebut if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to oneso if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to oneso it looks like...It looks like that, and it's undefined at threeand if x is less than three our function is equal to negative oneso it looks like - I'll be doing that same colorIt looks like this...It looks like...Looks like this...Once again, it's undefined at threeSo it looks like thatSo now let's try to answer our question:What is the limit as x approaches three?Well, let's think about the limit as x approaches threefrom the negative direction, from values less than threeSo let's think about first the limit......the limit, as x approaches three......as x approaches three, the limit of f(x)......as x approaches three from the negative directionand all this notation here - I wrote this negative as a superscript right after the three - saysLet's think about the limit as we're approaching......let me make this clear...Let's think about the limit as we're approaching from the leftSo in this case, if we get closer...If we get...If we start with values lower than threeas we get closer and closer and closer...So, say we start at zero, f(x) is equal to negative oneWe go to one, f(x) is equal to negative oneWe go to two, f(x) is equal to negative oneIf you go to 2.999999, f(x) is equal to negative oneSo it looks like it is approaching negative one if you approach.....if you approach from the left-hand sideNow let's think about the limit......the limit of f(x)......the limit of f(x) as x approaches three from the positive direction, from values greater than threeSo here we see, when x is equal to five, f(x) is equal to oneWhen x is equal to four, f(x) is equal to oneWhen x is equal to 3.0000001, f(x) is equal to oneSo it seems to be approaching...It seems to be approaching positive oneSo now we have something strangeWe seem to be approaching a different value when we approach from the leftthan when we approach from the rightand if we are approaching two different values then the limit does not existSo this limit right over here does not existor another way of saying it:The limit......the limit of...(Let me write this in a new color - I have a little idea here)...the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches some value c is equal to L if and only if......if and only if the limit of f(x) as x approaches c from the negative direction is equal to the limitof f(x) as x approaches c from the positive direction which is equal to LThis did not happen here -the limit when we approached the left was negative one,the limit when we approached from the right was positive one,So we did not get the same limits when we approached from either sideSo the limit does not exist in this case
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-using-algebraic-manipulation/v/limit-example-1	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that f of x is equal to x squared plus x minus 6over x minus 2.And we're curious about what the limit of fof x, as x approaches 2, is equal to.Now the first attempt that you mightwant to do right when you see something like this, isjust see what happens what is f of 2.Now this won't always be the limit, even if it's defined,but it's a good place to start, justto see if it's something reasonable could pop out.So looking at it this way, if we just evaluate f of 2,on our numerator, we get 2 squared plus 2 minus 6.So it's going to be 4 plus 2, which is 6, minus 6,so you're going to get 0 in the numeratorand you're going to get 0 in the denominator.So we don't have, the function is not defined,so not defined at x is equal 2.f not defined.So there's no simple thing there.Even if this did evaluate, if it was a continuous function,then the limit would be whatever the function is,but that doesn't necessarily mean the case.But we see very clearly the function is not defined here.So let's see if we can simplify thisand also try to graph it in some way.So one thing that might have jumped out at your headis you might want to factor this expression on top.So if we want to rewrite this, wecan rewrite the top expression.And this just goes back to your algebra one,two numbers whose product is negative 6,whose sum is positive 3, well that could be positive 3and negative 2.So this could be x plus 3 times xminus 2, all of that over x minus 2.So as long as x does not equal 2,these two things will cancel out.So we could say this is equal to x plus 3 for all X's exceptfor x is equal to 2.So that's another way of looking at it.Another way we could rewrite our f of x,we'll do it in blue, just to change the colors,we could rewrite f of x, this is the exact same function,f of x is equal to x plus 3 when x does not equal 2.And we could even say it's undefined when x is equal to 2.So given this definition, it becomes much clearerto us of how we can actually graph f of x.So let's try to do it.So that is, that is not anywhere near beinga straight line, that is much better.So let's call this the y-axis call it y equals f of x.And then let's, over here, let memake a horizontal line, that is my x-axis.So defined this way, f of x is equal to x plus 3.So if this is 1, 2, 3, we have a y-intercept at 3and then the slope is 1.And it's defined for all X's except for x is equal to 2.So this is x is equal to 1, x is equal to 2.So when x is equal to 2 it is undefined.So let me make sure I can, so it'sundefined right over there.So this is what f of x looks like.Now given this, let's try to answer our question.What is the limit of f of x as x approaches 2.Well, we can look at this graphically.As x approaches 2 from lower values in 2,so this right over here is x is equal to 2, if we get to maybe,let's say this is 1.7, we see that our f of xis right over there.If we get to 1.9, our f of x is right over there.So it seems to be approaching this value right over there.Similarly, as we approach 2 from values greater than it,if we're at, I don't know, this could be like 2.5,2.5 our f of x is right over there.If we get even closer to 2, our f of x is right over there.And once again, we look like we are approaching this value.Or another way of thinking about it,if we ride this line from the positive direction,we seem to be approaching this value for fof x, if we write this line from the negative direction,from values less than 2, we seem to be approachingthis value right over here.And this is essentially the value of x plus 3if we set x is equal to 2.So this is essentially going to be, this value right over here,is equal to 5.If we just look at it visually, if we justgraphed a line with slope 1 with the y-intercept of 3,this value right over here is 5.Now we could also try to do this it numerically,so let's try to do that.So if this is our function definition,completely identical to our original definition,then we just try values as x gets closer and closer to 2.So let's try values less than 2.So 1.9999, and this is almost obvious.1.9999 plus 3, well, that gets you pretty darn close to 5.If I put even more 9s here, get even closer to 2,we'd get even closer to 5 here.If we approach 2 from the positive direction,and then, we once again, we're getting closer and closerto 5 from the positive direction.If we were even closer to 2, we'd be even closer to 5.So whether we look at it numerically,or we look at it graphically, it looks pretty clearthat the limit here is going to be equal to five.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-using-algebraic-manipulation/v/limits-by-rationalizing	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can find the limitas x approaches negative 1of x plus 1over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2.So, our first reaction might just be,okay, well let's just use our limit propertiesa little bit,this is going to be the same thing as the limitas x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1over,over the limit,the limitas x approaches negative 1of square root of x plus 5 minus 2.And then we could say, all right,this thing up here,x plus 1, if this is,if we think about the graph y equals x plus 1,it's continuous everywhere, especially atx equals negative 1, and so to evaluate this limit,we just have to evaluate this expression atx equals negative 1,so this numerator's just going to evaluate to negative 1plus 1.And then our denominator,square root of x plus 5 minus 2 isn't continuous everywherebut it is continuous at x equals negative 1and so we can do the same thing.We can just substitute negative 1 for x,so this is going to be the square root of negative 1plus 5 minus 2.Now, what does this evaluate to?Well, in the numerator we get a zero,and in the denominator, negative 1 plus 5 is 4,take the principle root is 2, minus 2,we get zero again,so we get,we got zeroover zero.Now, when you see that, you might be tempted to give up.You say, oh, look, there's a zero in the denominator,maybe this limit doesn't exist,maybe I'm done here, what do I do?And if this was non-zero up here in the numerator,if you're taking a non-zero value and dividing it by zero,that is undefinedand your limit would not exist.But when you have zero over zero,this is indeterminate form,it doesn't mean necessarily that your limit does not exist,and as we'll see in this video and many future ones,there are tools at our disposal to address this,and we will look at one of them.Now, the tool that we're going to look atis is there another way of rewriting this expressionso we can evaluate its limitwithout getting the zero over zero?Well, let's just rewrite,let's just take this and give it,so let's take this thing right over here,and let's say this is g of x,so essentially what we're trying to do is find the limitof g of xas x approaches negative 1,so we can write g of x is equal tox plus 1 and the only reason I'm defining it as g of xis just to be able to think of it more clearly as a functionand manipulate the functionand then think about similar functions,over x plus 5 minus 2,or x plus 1 over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2.Now, the technique we're going to use is when you getthis indeterminate form and if you have a square rootin either the numerator or the denominator,it might help to get rid of that square rootand this is often called rationalizing the expression.In this case, you have a square root in the denominator,so it would be rationalizingthe denominator,and so, this would be,the way we would do itis we would be leveraging our knowledge of differenceof squares.We know,we know that a plus btimes a minus bis equal to a squared minus b squared,you learned that in algebraa little while ago,or if we had the square root of a plus band we were to multiply that times the square root of aminus b, well that would be the square root of a squaredwhich is just going to be a,minus b squared,so we can just leverage these ideasto get rid of this radical down here.The way we're going to do itis we're going to multiply the numerator and the denominatorby the square root of x plus 5plus 2, right?We have the minus 2so we multiply it times the plus 2,so let's do that.So we havesquare root of x plus 5 plus 2and we're going to multiply the numerator timesthe same thing, 'cause we don't want to change the valueof the expression.This is 1.So, if we take the expression divided by the same expressionit's going to be 1,so this is,so square root of x plus 5 plus 2and so this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to x plus 1times the square root,times the square root of x plus 5plus 2and then the denominator is going to be,well, it's going to be x,the square root of x plus 5 squaredwhich would be just x plus 5and then minus 2 squared,minus 4,and so this down here simplifies to x plus 5 minus 4is just x plus 1so this is just,this is just x plus 1and it probably jumps out at you that both the numeratorand the denominator have an x plus 1 in it,so maybe we can simplify,so we can simplify by just say,well, g of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5plus 2.Now, some of you might be feeling a little off here,and you would be correct.Your spider senses would be,is this,is this definitely the same thingas what we originally had before we cancelled outthe x plus 1s?And the answer is the way I just wrote itis not the exact same thing.It is the exact same thing everywhere except atx equals negative 1.This thing right over here is definedat x equals negative 1.This thing right over here is not definedat x equals negative 1,and g of x was not,was not,so g of x right over here,you don't get a good result when you try x equals negative 1and so in order for this to truly be the same thingas g of x,the same function, we have to sayfor x not equal to negative 1.Now, this is a simplified version of g of x.It is the same thing.For any input x,that g of x is defined, this is going to give you the sameoutput, and this is the exact same domain now,now that we've put this constraint in,as g of x.Now you might say, okay, well how does this help us?Because we want to find the limit as x approaches negative 1and even here, I had to put this little constraint herethat x cannot be equal to negative 1.How do we think about this limit?Well, lucky for us,we know,lucky for us we knowthat if we just take another function, f of x,if we say f of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5plus 2,well then we know that f of x is equal to g of xfor allx not equal to negative 1because f of x does not have that constraint.And we know if this is true of two,if this is true of two functions,then the limit as x approaches,the limit, let me write this down,since we know this,because of this,we know that the limitof f of xas x approaches negative 1 is going to be equalto the limit of g of xas x approaches negative 1,and this of course is what we want to figure out,what was the beginning of the problem,but we can now use f of x here,because only at x equals negative 1that they are not the same,and if you were to graph g of xit just has a,it has a point discontinuity,or removable discont--or, I should say, yeah,a point discontinuity right over hereat x equals negative 1,and so what is the limit?And we are in the home stretch now.What is the limitof f of x?Well, we could say the limit of the square root of x plus 5plus 2as x approaches negative 1,well, this expression is continuous.Or, this function is continuous at x equals negative 1so we can just evaluate it at x equals negative 1,so this is going to be the square root of negative 1plus 5 plus 2,so this is 4 square root,principle root of 4 is 2,2 plus 2 is equal to 4.So since the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1is 4, the limit of g of xas x approaches negative 1 is also 4,and if this little,this little,I guess you could say leap that I just made over heredoesn't make sense to you,think about it,think about it visually.Think about it visually.So if this ismy y-axisand this is my x-axis,g of x looked something like this.G of x,g of x, let me draw it,g of x looked something,something likethis,and it had a gap at negative 1,so it had a gap right over there,while f of x,f of x would have the same graphexcept it wouldn't have,it wouldn't have the gap,and so if you're trying to find the limit,it seems completely reasonable,well let's just use f of x and evaluate whatf of x would be to kind of fill that gapat x equals negative 1,so hopefully this graphical version helps a little bitor if it confuses you, ignore it.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-using-algebraic-manipulation/v/trig-limit-using-pythagorean-identity	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can find the limitas theta approaches zero of one minus cosine thetaover two sine squared theta.And like always, pause the video and see if youcould work through this.Alright, well our first temptation is to say,""Well, this is going to be the same thing""as the limit of one minus cosine theta""as X approaches, or not X,""as theta approaches zero.""of theta, as theta approaches zero,""over the limit,""as theta approaches zero""of two sine squared theta.""Now, both of these expressionswhich could be used to define a function,that they'd be continuous if you graph them.They'd be continuous at theta equals zero,so the limit is going to be the same thing,as just evaluating them at theta equals zeroSo this is going to be equal to one minus cosine of zeroover two sine squared of zero.Now, cosine of zero is one and then one minus one is zero,and sine of zero is zero, and you square it,You still got zero and you multiply times two,you still got zero.So you got zero over zero.So once again, we have that indeterminate form.And once again, this indeterminate formwhen you have zero over zero, doesn't mean to give up,it doesn't mean that the limit doesn't exist.It just means, well maybethere's some other approaches here to work on.If you got some non-zero number divided by zero,then you say, okay that limit doesn't existand you would say, well you just say it doesn't exist.But let's see what we can do to maybe, to maybe thinkabout this expression in a different way.So if we said,so let's just say that this,let me use some other colors here.Let's say that this right over hereis F of X.So, F of X is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two sine squared theta,and let's see if we can rewrite it in some waythat at least the limit as theta approaches zeroisn't going to, we're not gonna get the samezero over zero.Well, we can, we got some trig functions here,so maybe we can use some of our trig identitiesto simplify this.And the one that jumps out at meis that we have the sine squared of thetaand we know from the Pythagorean, Pythagorean Identityin Trigonometry, it comes straight out of the unit circledefinition of sine and cosine.We know that, we know that sine squared thetaplus cosine squared theta is equal to oneor, we know that sine squared thetais one minus cosine squared theta.One minus cosine squared theta.So we could rewrite this.This is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two times one minus cosine squared theta.Now, this is one minus cosine theta.This is a one minus cosine squared theta,so it's not completely obvious yetof how you can simplify it,until you realize that this could be viewedas a difference of squares.If you view this as,if you view this as A squared minus B squared,we know that this can be factored as A plus Btimes A minus B.So I could rewrite this.This is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two times,I could write this as one plus cosine thetatimes one minus cosine theta.One plus cosine theta times one minus, one minuscosine theta.And now this is interesting.I have one minus cosine thetain the numerator and I have a one minus cosine thetain the denominator.Now we might be tempted to say,""Oh, let's just cross that out with that""and we would get, we would simplify it""and get F of X is equal to one over""and we could distribute this two now.""We could say, ""Two plus two cosine theta.""We could say,""Well, aren't these the same thing?""And we would be almost right,because F of X, this one right over here,this, this is definedthis right over here is definedwhen theta is equal to zero,while this one is not defined when thetais equal to zero.When theta is equal to zero,you have a zero in the denominator.And so what we need to do in orderfor this F of X or in orderto be, for this to be the same thing,we have to say, theta cannot be equal to zero.But now let's think about the limit again.Essentially, what we want to do is we want to findthe limit as theta approaches zeroof F of X.And we can't just do direct substitutioninto, if we do, if we really take this seriously,'cause we're gonna like,""Oh well, if I try to put zero here,""it says theta cannot be equal to zero""F of X is not defined at zero.""This expression is defined at zerobut this tells me,""Well, I really shouldn't apply zero to this function.""But we know that if we can find another functionthat is defined, that is the exact same thing asF of X except at zero,and it is continuous at zero.And so we could say,""G of X is equal to one over two plus two""cosine theta.""Well then we know this limit is going to be theexact same thing as the limitof G of X, as theta approaches zero.Once again, these two functionsare identical except F of X is not definedat theta equals zero,while G of X is.But the limits as theta approaches zeroare going to be the same.And we've seen that in previous videos.And I know what a lot of you are thinking.Sal, this seems like a very, you know,why don't I just, you know, do this algebra here.Cross these things out of this.Substitute zero for theta.Well you could do that and you would get the answer,but you need to be clear if, or it's importantto be mathematically clear of what you are doing.If you do that, if you just crossed these two outand all of a sudden you're expressionbecomes defined at zero,you are now dealing with a different expressionor a different function definition.So to be clear, if you want to say this is the functionyou're finding the limit of,you have to put this constraint into make sure it has the exact same domain.But lucky for us, we can say,if we've had another, another function that's continuousat that point that doesn't have that gap there,that doesn't have that point discontinuity out,the limits are going to be equivalent.So the limit as theta approaches zero of G of X,well, that's just going to besince it's continuous at zero.We could say that's just going to be,we can just substitute.That's going to be equal to G of zerowhich is equal to one over two pluscosine two, one over two plus two times cosineof zero.Cosine of zero is one,so it's just one over two plus two,which is equal to,deserve a little bit of a drum roll here.Which is equal to one fourth.And we are done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-using-algebraic-manipulation/v/trig-limit-using-double-angle-identity	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] All right, let's see if we can find the limitof 1 over the square root of 2 sine of thetaover cosine of 2 theta,as theta approaches negative pi over 4.And like always, try to give it a shot before we go throughit together.Well, one take on it is well, let's just,let's just say that this is going to be the same thingas the limit,as theta approaches negative pi over 4of 1 plus square root of 2 sine thetaover the limitas theta approaches negative pi over 4.Make sure we can see that negative there,of cosine of 2 theta,and both of these expressions are,if these were function definitionsor if we were to graph y equals1 plus square root of sine,square root of 2 times sine theta,or y equals cosine of 2 theta,we would get continuous functions,especially at theta is equal to negative pi over 4,so we could just substitute in.We'll see well this is going to be equal tothis expression evaluated at negative pi over 4,so 1 plus square root of 2times sine of negative pi over 4,over cosineof 2 times negative pi over 4.Now, negative pi over 4,sine of negative pi over 4 is going to benegative square root of 2 over 2,so this is negative square root of 2 over 2,we're assuming this is in radians,if we're thinking in degrees, this would bea negative 45-degree angle, so this is one of the,one of the trig values that it's good to knowand so if you have,if you have 1,so let's see,actually, let me just rewrite it,so this is going to be equal to 1 plussquare root of 2 times thatis going to be negative 2 over 2,so this is going to beminus 1,that's the numerator over here.All of this stuff simplifies to negative 1over,this is going to be cosine ofnegative pi over 2, right?This is negative pi over 2,cosine of negative pi over 2, if you thought in degrees,that's going to be negative 90 degrees.Well, cosine of that is just going to be zero,so what we end up withis equal to zero over zero,and as we've talked about before,if we had something non-zero divided by zero,we'd say, okay, that's undefined.We might as well give up,but we have this indeterminate form, it does not meanthe limit does not exist.It's usually a clue that we should use some toolsin our toolkit, one of which is to do some manipulationhere to get an expression that maybe is definedat theta is equal to,or does not,is not an indeterminate form,that theta is equal to pi over 4and we'll see other tools in our toolkit in the future.So let me algebraically manipulate this a little bit.So if I have 1 plus the square root of 2,sine theta, over cosine 2 theta,as you can imagine,the things that might be useful here are our trig identitiesand in particular, cosine of 2 theta seems interesting.Let me write some trig identities involving cosineof 2 theta.I'll write it over here.So we know that cosineof 2 thetais equal tocosine squared of thetaminus sine squared of thetawhich is equal to 1minus 2 sine squared of thetawhich is equal to2 cosine squared theta minus 1,and you can go from this one to this one to this onejust using the Pythagorean identity.We proved that in earlier videos in trigonometryon Khan Academy.Now, do any of these look useful?Well, all of these three are going to be differencesof squares, so we can factor them in interesting ways,and remember, our goal at the end of the dayis maybe cancel things out that are making us get thiszero over zero,and if I could factor thisinto something that involved a 1 plus square rootof 2 sine theta,then I'm going to be in business,and it looks like,it looks like this right over here,that can be factored as1 plus square root of 2 sine thetatimes1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,so let me use this.Cosine of 2 theta is the same thing,cosine of 2 theta is the same thingas 1 minus 2 sine squared theta,which is just a difference of squares.We can rewrite that as,this is a-squared minus b-squared,this is a plus b times a minus b,so I can just replace this with1 plus square root of 2 sine thetatimes 1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,and now, we have some nice cancelling,or potential cancelling that can occur,so we could saythat cancels with thatand we could say that that is going to be equal,and let me do this in a new color,this is going to be equal to,in the numerator we just have 1,in the denominator we just are left with1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,and if we want these expressions to truly be equal,we would have to have them to have the same,if you view them as function definitions,as having the same domain,so this one right over here,this one we already saw isnot defined at theta is equal to negative pi over 4,and so this one,in order for these to be equivalent,we have to say that this one is also not,and actually, other places, but let's just,let's just say thetadoes not,does not equal negative,negative pi over 4,and we could think about all of this happeningin some type of an open interval around negative pi over 4if we wanted to get very precise,but if we wanted to,for this particular case,well, let's just say,everything we're doing is in the open interval,so in,in open interval,in open interval betweentheta,or, say, negative 1 and 1,and I think that covers itbecause if we have pi,if we have pi over 4that is not going to get us thezero over zero form,and pi over 4would make this denominator equal to zerobut it also makes,let's see, pi over 4 also will make this denominatorequal to zero,'cause we would get 1 minus 1,so I think,I think we're good if we're just assuming,if we're restricted to this open intervaland that's okay because we're taking the limitas it approaches something within this open interval,and I'm being extra precise because I'm trying to explain itto you and it's important to be precise,but obviously, if you're working this out on a testor notebook, you wouldn't be taking,putting,or taking as much troubleto be putting all of these caveats in.So, what we've now realizedis that, okay,this expression,actually, let's think about this.Let's think about the limit,the limit as theta approaches negative pi over 4of this thing,without the restriction,of 1 over 1 minus the square root of 2sine of theta.If we're dealing with this over,you know, with this open interval,wait, actually, even disregarding that,theta,this theta,or this expression is continuous at,it is defined and it is continuousat theta is equal to negative pi over 4so this is just going to be equal to1 over 1 minus the square root of 2times sine ofnegative pi over 4.Sine of negative pi over 4.Sine of negative pi over 4,we've already seen is negative square root of 2 over 2,and so this is going to be equal to 1 over1 minus square root of 2 timesthe negative square root of 2 over 2,so negative, negative,you get a positive,square root of 2 times square root of 2is 2, over 2 is going to be 1.So this is going to be equal to 1/2.And so,I want to be very clear.This expression is not the same thingas this expression.They are the same thing at all values of theta,especially if we're dealing in this open intervalexcept at theta equalsnegative pi over 4.This one is not definedand this one is defined,but as we've seen multiple times before,if we find a functionthat is equal to our originalor an expression,is equal to our original expression,and all values of thetaexcept,except where the original one was not definedat a certain point,but this new one is defined and is continuous there,well then these two limits are going to be equal,so if this limit is 1/2,then this limit is going to be 1/2,and I've said this in previous videos.It might be very tempting to say, well,I'm just going to algebraically simplify this in some wayto get this,and I'm not going to worry about too much aboutthese constraints, and then I'm just going to substitutenegative pi over 4,and you will get this answerwhich is the correct answerbut it's really important to recognizethat this expression and this expressionare not the same thingand what allows you to do this is,is the truththat if you have two functions,if you have f and g,two functions equal,let me write it this way,equal,equal forall x,except for all,wait, let me just write this this way,for all x except for a,then the limit,then, and let me write it this way,equal for all except,for all x except aand f continuous,continuous at a,then,then the limit of f of xas x approaches ais going to be equal to the limit of g of xas x approaches a,and I said this in multiple videosand that's what we are doing right here,but just so you can make sure you got it right,the answer here is 1/2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-strategy-in-finding-limits/v/flow-chart-of-limit-strategies	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Multiple videos and exerciseswe cover the various techniquesfor finding limits.But sometimes, it's helpful to think about strategiesfor determining which technique to use.And that's what we're going to cover in this video.What you see here is a flowchartdeveloped by the team at Khan Academy,and I'm essentially going to work through that flowchart.It looks a little bit complicated at first,but hopefully it will make senseas we talk it through.So the goal is, hey,we want to find the limit of f of xas x approaches a.So what this is telling us to do is,well the first thing,just try to substitute what happens when x equals a.Let's evaluate f of a.And this flowchart says,if f of a is equal to a real number,it's saying we're done.But then there's this little caveat here.Probably.And the reason why is that the limit is a different thingthan the value of the function.Sometimes they happen to be the same.In fact, that's the definition of a continuous functionwhich we talk about in previous videos,but sometimes, they aren't the same.This will not necessarily be trueif you're dealing with some functionthat has apointdiscontinuity like thator a jump discontinuity,or a function that looks like this.This would not necessarily be the case.But if at that pointyou're trying to find the limit towards,as you approach this point right over here,the function is continuous,it's behaving somewhat normally,then this is a good thing to keep in mind.You could just say, hey,can I just evaluate the functionat thatat thata over there?So in general, if you're dealing withpretty plain vanilla functions like an x squaredor if you're dealing with rational expressions like thisor trigonometric expressions,and if you're able to just evaluate the functionand it gives you a real number,you are probably done.If you're dealing with some type of a functionthat has all sorts of special casesand it's piecewise definedas we've seen in previous other videos,I would be a little bit more skeptical.Or if you know visually around that point,there's some type of jumpor some type of discontinuity,you've got to be a little bit more careful.But in general,this is a pretty good rule of thumb.If you're dealing with plain vanilla functionsthat are continuous,if you evaluate at x equals aand you got a real number,that's probably going to be the limit.But I always think about the other scenarios.What happens if you evaluate itand you get some number divided by zero?Well, that case,you are probably dealing with a vertical asymptote.And what do we mean by vertical asymptote?Well, look at this example right over here.Where we just say the limitput that in a darker color.So if we're talking aboutthe limitas x approaches oneof one overx minus one,if you just try to evaluate this expressionat x equals one,you would get one over one minus onewhich is equal to one over zero.It says, okay,I'm throwing it,I'm falling into this vertical asymptote case.And at that point,if you wanted to just understand what was going on thereor even verify that it's a vertical asymptote,well then you can try out some numbers,you can try to plot it,you can say, alright,I probably have a vertical asymptote hereat x equals one.So that's my vertical asymptote.And you can try out some values.Well, let's see.If x is greater than one,the denominator is going to be positive,and so, my graphand you would get this from trying out a bunch of values.Might look something like thisand then for values less than negative oneor less than one I should say,you're gonna get negative valuesand so, your graph might looklike something like thatuntil you have this vertical asymptote.That's probably what you have.Now, there are cases,very special cases,where you won't necessarily have the vertical asymptote.One example of that would be something likeone over xminus x.This one here is actually undefined for any x you give it.So, it would be very,you will not have a vertical asymptote.But this is a very special case.Most times,you do have a vertical asymptote there.But let's say we don't fall into either of those situations.What if when we evaluate the function,we get zero over zero?And here is an example of that.Limit is x approaches negative oneof this rational expression.Let's try to evaluate it.You get negative one squared which is oneminus negative one which is plus oneminus two.So you get zero the numerator.And the denominator you have negative one squaredwhich is oneminus two times negative oneso plus twominus three which is equal to zero.Now this is known as indeterminate form.And so on our flowchart,we then continue to the right side of itand so here's a bunch of techniquesfor trying to tackle something in indeterminate form.Andlikely in a few weeksyou will learn another techniquethat involves a little more calculuscalled L'hospital's Rule that we don't tackle herebecause that involves calculuswhile all of these techniques can be donewith things before calculus.Some algebraic techniquesand some trigonometric techniques.So the first thing that you might want totry to doespecially if you're dealing with a rational expressionlike thisand you're getting indeterminate form,is try to factor it.Try to seeif you can simplify this expression.And this expression here,you can factor it.This is the same thing asxx minus twotimes x plus oneoverxthis would be x minus threetimes x plus oneif what I just did seems completely foreign to youI encourage you to watch the videos on factoringfactoring polynomialsor factoring quadratics.And so,you can see here, alright.If I make theI can simplify this 'causeas long as x does not equal negative one,these two things are going to cancel out.So I can say that this is going to be equal to x minus twoover x minus threefor x does not equal negative one.Sometimes people forget to do this part.This is if you're really being mathematically precise.This entire expression is the same as this one.Because this entire expression is still not definedif x equals negative one.Although you can substitute x equals negative one hereand now get a value.So if you substitute x equals negative one hereeven if it's formally taking it away to bemathematically equivalent,this would be negative oneminus twowhich would bewhich would be negative threeover negative one minus threewhich should be negative fourwhich is equal to three fourths.So if this condition wasn't here,you can just evaluate it straight up andthis is a pretty plain vanilla function.Wouldn't expect to see anything crazy happening here.And if I can just evaluate it at x equals negative oneI feel pretty good.I feel pretty good.So once again, we're now going in factoring.We're able to factor.We have valued,we simplify it.We evaluate the expressionthe simplified expression now,and now we were able to get a value.We were able to get three fourths,and so we can feel pretty good that the limit herein this situation is three fourths.Now, let'sand I would categorize what we've seenso far isthe bulk of the limit exercisesthat you will likely encounter.Now the next two,I would call slightly fancier techniques.So if you get indeterminate formespecially you'll sometimes see it with radical expressionslike this.Rational radical expressions.You might want to multiply by conjugate.So for example, in this situation right here,if you just try to evaluate it x equals four,you get the square root of four minus twoover four minus fourwhich is zero over zero.So it's that indeterminate form.And the technique here, because we're seeingthis radical and a rational expressionlet's say, maybe we can somehow get rid of that radicalor simplify it somehow.So let me rewrite.Square root of x minus twooverxminus four.Let's say a conjugate,let's multiply it by the square root of x plus twoover the square root of x plus two.Once again,it's the same expression over the same expression.So I'm not fundamentally changing its value.And so this is going to be equal to,well if I have a plus b times a minus bI'm gonna get a difference of squares.So it's gonna be square root of x squaredwhich is,it's going to be square root of x squaredminus fouroverwell square root of x squaredis just going to bex minus four.So let me rewrite it that way.So that's x minus fouroverx minus fourtimes square root of x plus two,square root of x plus two.Well, this was useful because nowI can cancel out x equals fouror x minus four right over here.And once again, if I wanted itmathematically to be the exact same expression,I'd say well, now this is going to be equal tooneone over the square root of x plus twofor x does not equal four,but we can definitely see whatthis function is approachingif we just now substitute x equals fourinto this simplified expression.And so, that's just gonna be one overso if we just substituteif we just substitute x equals four hereyou'd get one over square root of fourplus twowhich is equal to one fourth.And once again, you can feel pretty goodthat this is going to beyour limit.We've gone back into the green zone.If you're actually to plotthis original function,you would have a point discontinuity.You would have a gap at x equalsfourbut then when you do that simplificationand factoring out that x minusor canceling out that x minus four,that gap would disappear.So that's essentially what you're doing.You're trying to find the limit as we approachthat gap which we got right there.Now, this final one.This is dealing with trig identities.And in order to do these,you have to be pretty adept at your trig identities.So if we're saying the limit,I'll do that at a darker color.So if we're saying the limitas x approaches zeroof sine of xover sineof two xwell, sine of zero zero,sine of zero zero,you're gonna be at zero, zero.Once you get indeterminate form,we fall into this category,and now you might recognize this is going to beequal to the limitas x approaches zero of sine of xwe can rewrite sine of two xas two sinex cosine xand then those two can cancel out for all x's notequalingfor all x's not equaling zeroif you want to be really mathematically precise.And so, there would've been a gap there for sureon the original graphif you were to graph y equals this.But now, for the limit purposes,you can say this is this limitisthis limit is going to be the limitas x approaches zeroof one over two cosine of x.And now we can go back tothis green condition right over here,because we can evaluate this at x equals zero.It's going to be one over two times cosine of zero.Cosine of zero is one.So this is going to be equal to one half.Now in general, none of these techniques work,and you will encounter few other techniquesfurther on once you learn more calculus,then you fall on the base line.Approximation.And approximation, you can do it numerically.Try values really really really closeto the number you're trying to find the limit on.If you're trying to find the limit as x approaches zerotry 0.00000000001.Try negative 0.0000001if you're trying to find the limit is x approaches fourtry 4.0000001.Try 3.9999999999and see what happens.But that's kind of the last ditch.The last ditch effort.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-squeeze-theorem/v/squeeze-sandwich-theorem	khanacademy	video	":00We're now going to think about oneof my most favorite theorems in mathematics,and that's the squeeze theorem.And one of the reasons that it's one of my most favorite theoremin mathematics is that it has the word ""squeeze"" in it,a word that you don't see showing upin a lot of mathematics.But it is appropriately named.And this is oftentimes also called the sandwich theorem,which is also an appropriate name, as we'll see in a second.And since it can be called the sandwich theorem,let's first just think about an analogyto get the intuition behind the squeeze or the sandwichtheorem.Let's say that there are three people.Let's say that there is Imran, let's say there's Diya,and let's say there is Sal.And let's say that Imran, on any given day,he always has the fewest amount of calories.And Sal, on any given day, alwayshas the most number of calories.So in a given day, we can always sayDiya eats at least as much as Imran.And then we can say Sal eats at least as much-- that'sjust to repeat those words-- as Diya.And so we could set up a little inequality here.On a given day, we could write that Imran's calorieson a given day are going to be less than or equal to Diya'scalories on that same day, which is going to be less thanor equal to Sal's calories on that same day.Now let's say that it's Tuesday.Let's say on Tuesday you find outthat Imran ate 1,500 calories.And on that same day, Sal also ate 1,500 calories.So based on this, how many caloriesmust Diya have eaten that day?Well, she always eats at least as many as Imran's, so sheate 1,500 calories or more.But she always has less than or equal to the number of caloriesSal eats.So it must be less than or equal to 1,500.Well, there's only one number thatis greater than or equal to 1,500 and less thanor equal to 1,500, and that is 1,500 calories.So Diya must have eaten 1,500 calories.This is common sense.Diya must have had 1,500 calories.And the squeeze theorem is essentiallythe mathematical version of this for functions.And you could even view this is Imran's calories as a functionof the day, Sal's calories as a function of the day,and Diya's calories as a function of the dayis always going to be in between those.So now let's make this a little bit more mathematical.So let me clear this out so we can have some spaceto do some math in.So let's say that we have the same analogy.So let's say that we have three functions.Let's say f of x over some intervalis always less than or equal to gof x over that same interval, which is always less thanor equal to h of x over that same interval.So let me depict this graphically.So that is my y-axis.This is my x-axis.And I'll just depict some intervalin the x-axis right over here.So let's say h of x looks something like that.Let me make it more interesting.This is the x-axis.So let's say h of x looks something like this.So that's my h of x.Let's say f of x looks something like this.Maybe it does some interesting things, and then it comes in,and then it goes up like this, so f of xlooks something like that.And then g of x, for any x-value, gof x is always in between these two.And I think you see where the squeeze is happeningand where the sandwich is happening.If h of x and f of x were bendy pieces of bread, g of xwould be the meat of the bread.So it would look something like this.Now, let's say that we know-- this is the analogous thing.On a particular day, Sal and Imran ate the same amount.Let's say for a particular x-value,the limit as f and h approach that x-value, theyapproach is the same limit.So let's take this x-value right over here.Let's say the x-value is c right over there.And let's say that the limit of fof x as x approaches c is equal to L. And let's saythat the limit as x approaches c of h of x is also equal to L.So notice, as x approaches c, h of xapproaches L. As x approaches c from either side, f of xapproaches L.So these limits have to be defined.Actually, the functions don't haveto be defined at x approaches c.Just over this interval, they haveto be defined as we approach it.But over this interval, this has to be true.And if these limits right over here are definedand because we know that g of x is always sandwiched inbetween these two functions, therefore,on that day or for that x-value--I should get out of that food-eating analogy--this tells us if all of this is true over this interval,this tells us that the limit as x approaches c of g of xmust also be equal to L.And once again, this is common sense.f of x is approaching L, h of x is approachingL, g of x is sandwiched in between it.So it also has to be approaching L.And you might say, well, this is common sense.Why is this useful?Well, as you'll see, this is useful for findingthe limits of some wacky functions.If you can find a function that's always greater than itand a function that's always less than it,and you can find the limit as they approach some c,and it's the same limit, then youknow that that wacky function in betweenis going to approach that same limit."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-squeeze-theorem/v/sinx-over-x-as-x-approaches-0	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois prove that the limitas theta approaches zeroof sine of thetaover theta is equal to one.So let's start with a little bit of a geometricor trigonometric construction that I have here.So this white circle, this is a unit circle,that we'll label it as such.So it has radius one,unitcircle.So what does the lengthof this salmon-colored line represent?Well, the height of this line would be the y-coordinateof where this radius intersects the unit circle.And so by definition, by the unit circle definitionof trig functions, the length of this lineis going to be sine of theta.If we wanted to make sure that also worked for thetasthat end up in the fourth quadrant, which will be useful,we can just insure that it's the absolute valueof the sine of theta.Now what about this blue line over here?Can I express that in terms of a trigonometric function?Well, let's think about it.What would tangent of theta be?Let me write it over here.Tangent of thetais equal to opposite over adjacent.So if we look at this broader triangle right over here,this is our angle theta in radians.This is the opposite side.The adjacent side down here, this just has length one.Remember, this is a unit circle.So this just has length one,so the tangent of theta is the opposite side.The opposite side is equal to the tangent of theta.And just like before, this is going to be a positive valuefor sitting here in the first quadrantbut I want things to workin both the first and the fourth quadrantfor the sake of our proof,so I'm just gonna put an absolute value here.So now that we've done,I'm gonna think about some trianglesand their respective areas.So first, I'm gonna draw a trianglethat sits in this wedge, in this pie piece,this pie slice within the circle,so I can construct this triangle.And so let's think about the areaof what I am shading in right over here.How can I express that area?Well, it's a triangle.We know that the area of a triangleis 1/2 base times height.We know the heightis the absolute value of the sine of thetaand we know that the base is equal to one,so the area here is going to be equal to 1/2times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of the sine of theta.I'll rewrite it over here.I can just rewrite thatas the absolute value of the sine of theta over two.Now let's think about the area of this wedgethat I am highlighting in this yellow color.So what fraction of the entire circle is this going to be?If I were to go all the way around the circle,it would be two pi radians,so this is theta over to two pis of the entire circleand we know the area of the circle.This is a unit circle, it has a radius one,so it'd be times the area of the circle,which would be pi times the radius square,the radius is one, so it's just gonna be times pi.And so the area of this wedge right over here,theta over two.And if we wanted to make this workfor thetas in the fourth quadrant,we could just write an absolute value sign right over there'cause we're talking about positive area.And now let's think about this larger trianglein this blue color, and this is pretty straightforward.The area here is gonna be 1/2 times base times height.So the area, and once again, this is this entire are,that's going to be 1/2 times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of tangent of theta.And so I can just write that downas the absolute value of the tangent of theta over two.Now, how would you compare the areasof this pink or this salmon-colored trianglewhich sits inside of this wedgeand how do you compare that area of the wedgeto the bigger triangle?Well, it's clear that the area of the salmon triangleis less than or equal to the area of the wedgeand the area of the wedge is less than or equal tothe area of the big, blue triangle.The wedge includes the salmon triangleplus this area right over here,and then the blue triangle includes the wedgeplus it has this area right over here.So I think we can feel good visuallythat this statement right over here is trueand I'm just gonna doa little bit of algebraic manipulation.Let me multiply everything by twoso I can rewrite that the absolute valueof sine of theta is less than or equal tothe absolute value of thetawhich is less than or equal to the absolute valueof tangent of theta, and let's see.Actually, instead of writing the absolute valueof tangent of theta, I'm gonna rewrite thatas the absolute value of sine of thetaover the absolute value of cosine of theta.That's gonna be the same thingas the absolute value of tangent of theta.And the reason why I did thatis we can now divide everythingby the absolute value of sine of theta.Since we're dividing by a positive quantity,it's not going to change the direction of the inequalities.So let's do thatI'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of sine of theta.I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of thetaand then I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of theta.And what do I get?Well, over here, I get a oneand on the right-hand side, I get a oneover the absolute value of cosine theta.These two cancel out.So the next step I'm gonna dois take the reciprocal of everything.And so when I take the reciprocal of everything,that actually will switch the inequalities.The reciprocal of one is still going to be onebut now, since I'm taking the reciprocal of this here,it's gonna be greater than or equal tothe absolute value of the sine of thetaover the absolute value of theta,and that's going to be greater than or equal tothe reciprocal of oneover the absolute value of cosine of thetais the absolute value of cosine of theta.We really just care about the first and fourth quadrants.You can think about this thetaapproaching zero from that directionor from that direction there,so that would be the first and fourth quadrants.So if we're in the first quadrant and theta is positive,sine of theta is gonna be positive as well.And if we're in the fourth quadrant and theta's negative,well, sine of theta is gonna have the same sign.It's going to be negative as well.And so these absolute value signs aren't necessary.In the first quadrant,sine of theta and theta are both positive.In the fourth quadrant, they're both negative,but when you divide them,you're going to get a positive value, so I can erase those.If we're in the first or fourth quadrant,our X value is not negative,and so cosine of theta, which is the x-coordinateon our unit circle, is not going to be negative,and so we don't need the absolute value signs over there.Now, we should pause a secondbecause we're actually almost done.We have just set up three functions.You could think of this as f of x is equal to,you could view this as f of theta is equal to one,g of theta is equal to this,and h of theta is equal to that.And over the interval that we care about,we could say for negative pi over twois less than theta is less than pi over two,but over this interval, this is true for any thetaover which these functions are defined.Sine of theta over theta is defined over this interval,except where theta is equal to zero.But since we're defined everywhere else,we can now find the limit.So what we can say is, well, by the squeeze theoremor by the sandwich theorem,if this is true over the interval,then we also know that the following is true.And this, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.The limitas theta approaches zero of thisis going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this,which is the one that we care about,sine of theta over theta,which is going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this.Now this is clearly going to be just equal to one.This is what we care about.And this, what's the limit as theta approaches zeroof cosine of theta?Well, cosine of zero is just oneand it's a continuous function,so this is just gonna be one.So let's see.This limit is going to be less than or equal to oneand it's gonna be greater than or equal to one,so this must be equal to oneand we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-squeeze-theorem/v/1-cosx-over-x-as-x-approaches-0	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we wanna do in this videois figure out what the limit, as x approaches zero,of one minus cosine of x over x is equal to.And we're going to assume we know one thing ahead of time.We're going to assume we know that the limit,as x approaches zero, of sine of x over x,that this is equal to one.Now, I'm not gonna reprove this in this video,but we have a whole other videodedicated to proving this famous limit,and we do it using the squeeze, or the sandwich theorem.So, let's see if we can work this out.So the first thing we're going to dois algebraically manipulate this expression.What I'm going to do is I'm going to multiplyboth the numerator and the denominatorby one plus cosine of x.So, times...The denominator I have to do the same thing,one plus cosine of x.I'm not changing the value of the expression,this is just multiplying it by one.What does that do for us?Well I can rewrite the whole thing asthe limit, as x approaches zero,so one minus cosine of x times one plus cosine of x,well that is just going to be...Put this in another color.That is going to be one squared, which is just one,minus cosine squared of x.Cosine squared of x, difference of squares.And then in the denominator, I am going to havethese, which is just x times 1 plus cosine of x.Now what is one minus cosine squared of x?Well, this comes straight out of thePythagorean identity, trig identity.This is the same thing as the sine squared of x.So, sine squared of x.And so, I can rewrite all of this as being equal tothe limit, as x approaches zero,and let me rewrite this as...Instead of sine squared of x,that's the same thing as sine of x times sine of x.Let me write it that way.Sine x times sine x.So, I'll take the first sine of x,so I'll take this one right over here,and put it over this x.So, sine of x over xtimes the second sine of x, this one,over one plus cosine of xtimes sine of x over one plus cosine of x.All I've done is I've leveraged a trigonometric identity,and I've done a little bit of algebraic manipulation.Well here, the limit of the productof these two expressions, is going to be the same thingas the product of the limits.So I can rewrite this as being equal tothe limit, as x approaches zero, of sine of x over xtimes the limit, as x approaches zero,of sine of x over one plus cosine of x.Now, we said, going into this video,that we're going to assume that we know what this is.We've proven it in other videos.What is the limit, as x approaches zero,of sine of x over x?Well, that is equal to one.So, this whole limit is just going to be dependenton whatever this is equal to.Well, this is pretty straight forward, here.As x approaches zero, the numerator's approaching zero,sine of zero is zero.The denominator is approaching...Cosine of zero is one,so the denominator is approaching two.So this is approaching zero over two, or just zero.That's approaching zero.One times zero, well this is just going to be equal to zero.And we're done.Using that fact, and a little bit of trig identities,and a little bit of algebraic manipulation,we were able to show that our original limit,the limit, as x approaches zero,of one minus cosine of x over x is equal to zero.And I encourage you to graph it.You will see that that makes sensefrom a graphical point of view, as well.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-types-of-discontinuities/v/types-of-discontinuities	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois talk about the various types of discontinuitiesthat you've probably seen when you took algebra,or precalculus, but then relate it to our understandingof both two-sided limits and one-sided limits.So let's first review the classification of discontinuities.So here on the left, you see that this curvelooks just like y equals x squared,until we get to x equals three.And instead of it being three squared,at this point you have this opening,and instead the function at three is defined at four.But then it keeps going and it looks just likey equals x squared.This is known as a point,or a removable, discontinuity.And it's called that for obvious reasons.You're discontinuous at that point.You might imagine defining or redefining the functionat that point so it is continuous,so that this discontinuity is removable.But then how does this relate to our definitionof continuity?Well, let's remind ourselves our definition of continuity.We say f is continuous,continuous,if and only if,or let me write f continuousat x equals c, if and only ifthe limit as x approaches cof f of x is equal to the actual value of the functionwhen x is equal to c.So why does this one fail?Well, the two-sided limit actually exists.You could find, if we say c in this case is three,the limitas x approaches threeof f of x,it looks like, and if you graphically inspect this,and I actually know this is the graph of y equals x squared,except at that discontinuity right over there,this is equal to nine.But the issue is, the way this graph has been depicted,this is not the same thing as the value of the function.This functionf of three, the way it's been graphed,f of three is equal to four.So this is a situation where this two-sided limit exists,but it's not equal to the value of that function.You might see other circumstances where the functionisn't even defined there,so that isn't even there.And so, once again, the limit might exist,but the function might not be defined there.So, in either case, you aren't going to meet this criteriafor continuity.And so that's how a point or removable discontinuity,why it is discontinuouswith regards to our limit definition of continuity.So now let's look at this second example.If we looked at our intuitive continuity test,if we would just try to trace this thing,we see that once we get to x equals two,I have to pick up my pencil to keep tracing it.And so that's a pretty good sign that we are discontinuous.We see that over here as well.If I'm tracing this function, I gotta pick up my pencil to,I can't go to that point.I have to jump down here,and then keep going right over there.So in either case I have to pick up my pencil.And so, intuitively, it is discontinuous.But this particular type of discontinuity,where I am making a jump from one point,and then I'm making a jump down here to continue,it is intuitively called a jumpdiscontinuity,discontinuity.And this is, of course, a point removable discontinuity.And so how does this relate to limits?Well, here, the left and right-handed limits exist,but they're not the same thing,so you don't have a two-sided limit.So, for example, for this one in particular,for all the x-values up to and including x equals two,this is the graph of y equals x squared.And then for x greater than two,it's the graph of square root of x.So in this scenario,if you were to take the limitof f of xas x approachestwofrom the left,from the left,this is going to be equal to four,you're approaching this value.And that actually is the value of the function.But if you were to take the limit as x approaches twofrom the right of f of x,what is that going to be equal to?Well, approaching from the right,this is actually the square root of x,so it's approaching the square root of two.You wouldn't know it's the square root of twojust by looking at this.I know that, just because when I,when I went on to Desmos and defined the function,that's the function that I used.But it's clear even visuallythat you're approaching two different valueswhen you approach from the leftthan when you approach from the right.So even though the one-sided limits exist,they're not approaching the same thing,so the two-sided limit doesn't exist.And if the two-sided limit doesn't exist,it for sure cannot be equal to the valueof the function there, even if the function is defined.So that's why the jump discontinuity is failing this test.Now, once again, it's intuitive.You're seeing that, hey, I gotta jump,I gotta pick up my pencil.These two things are not connected to each other.Finally, what you see here is,when you learned precalculus,often known as an asymptotic discontinuity,asymptotic,asymptoticdiscontinuity,discontinuity.And, intuitively, you have an asymptote here.It's a vertical asymptote at x equals two.If I were to try to trace the graphfrom the left,I would just keep on going.In fact, I would be doing it forever, 'cause it's,it would be infinitely,it would be unbounded as I get closer and closerto x equals two from the left.And if try to get to x equals two from the right,once again I get unbounded up.But even if I could,and when I say it's unbounded, it goes to infinity,so it's actually impossiblein a mortal's lifespan to try to trace the whole thing.But you get the sense that, hey, there's no way that I coulddraw from here to here without picking up my pencil.And if you wanna relate it to our notion of limits,it's thatboth the left and right-handed limits are unbounded,so they officially don't exist.So if they don't exist, then we can't meet these conditions.So if I were to say,the limitas x approaches two from the left-hand side of f of x,we can see that it goes unbounded in the negative direction.You might sometimes see someone write something like this,negative infinity.But that's a little handwavy with the math.The more correct way to say it is it's just unbounded,unbounded.And, likewise, if we thought about the limitas x approaches twofrom the rightof f of x,it is now unbounded towards positive infinity.So this, once again,this is also,this is also unbounded.Andbecause it's unbounded and this limit does not exist,it can't meet these conditions.And so we are going to be discontinuous.So this is a point or removable discontinuity,jump discontinuity, I'm jumping,and then we have these asymptotes, a vertical asymptote.This is an asymptotic discontinuity.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-continuity-at-a-point/v/continuity-at-a-point	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois come up with a more rigorous definition for continuity.And the general idea of continuity,we've got an intuitive idea of the past,is that a function is continuous at a point,is if you can draw the graph of that functionat that point without picking up your pencil.So what do we mean by that?And this is...What I just said is not that rigorous,or not rigorous at all,is that well, let's think about the point right over here.Let's say that's RC.If I can draw the graph at that point,the value of the function at that pointwithout picking up my pencil, or my pen,then it's continuous there.So I could just start here,and I don't have to pick up my pencil,and there you go.I can go through that point,so we could say that our function is continuous there.But if I had a function that lookedsomewhat different that that,if I had a function that looked like this,let's say that it is defined up until then,and then there's a bit of a jump,and then it goes like this,well this would be very hard to draw at...This function would be very hard to drawgoing through x equals c without picking up my pen.Let's see, my pen is touching the screen,touching the screen, touching the screen.How do I keep drawing this functionwithout picking up my pen?I would have to pick it up,and then move back down here.And so that is an intuitive sensethat we are not continuous in this case right over here.Well let's actually come upwith a formal definition for continuity,and then see if it feels intuitive for us.So the formal definition of continuity, let's start here,we'll start with continuity at a point.So we could say the function f is continuous...Continuous at x equals c.If, and only if...I'll draw this two-way arrow to show if, and only if,the two-sided limit of f of x,as x approaches c,is equal to f of c.So this seems very technical.But let's just think about what it's saying.It's saying look,if the limit as we approach cfrom the left and the right of f of x,if that's actually the value of our function there,then we are continuous at that point.So let's look at three examples.Let's look at one example, we are, we're...By our picking-up-the-pencil idea,it feels like we are continuous at a point.And then let's think about a couple of exampleswhere it doesn't seem like we're continuous at a point,and see how this more rigorous definition applies.So, let's say that my function...So let's say this right over hereis y is equal to f of x.And, we care about the behavior right over herewhen x is equal to c.This is my X-axis, that's my Y-axis.So we care about the behavior when x is equal to c.And so, notice,from our first intuitive sense,I can definitely draw this functionas we go through x equals c without picking up my pencil,so it feels continuous there.There's no jumps or discontinuities that we can tell.It just kind of keeps on going.It seems all connected, is one way to think about it.But let's think about this definition.Well, the limit as x approaches c from the left, it is...As we approach from the left,it looks like it is approaching...It looks like it is approaching f of c.So this is the value, f of c right over here.And as we approach from the right,as we approach from the right,it also looks like it's approaching f of c.And we are defined right at x equals c.And it is the value that we are approachingfrom both the left or the right.So this seems good in this scenario.So now let's look at some scenariosthat we would have to pick up the pencilas we draw the function through that point, through that...Through that...When x is equal to c.So let's look at a scenario.Let's look at a scenario where we havewhat's often called a point discontinuity,although you don't have to know at this point,no pun intended, the formal terminology for it.So let's say we have a function that...Let's see, this is c.Now let's say our function looks something...Something like this.So we go like this,and at c let's say it's equal to that.So, f of c is right over here.F of c would be that value.But what's the limit as x approaches c?So the limit as x approaches c,this would be a two-sided limit of f of x.Well, this is, as we approach from the left,it looks like we are approaching this value right over here.And from the right,it looks like we are approaching that same value.And so, we could call that L.And L is different than f of c.And so, in this case, by our formal definition,we will not be continuous at, for...F will not be continuous for x is equal...Or at the point x...Or when x is equal to c.And you can see that there.If we try to draw this, okay,my pencil is touching the paper,touching the paper, touching the paper.Uh oh, if I needed to keep drawing this function,I'd have to pick up my pencil, move it over here,then pick it up again and then jump right back down.And but this rigorous definitionis giving us the same conclusion.The limit as we approach x equals cfrom the left and the right,it's a different value than f of c.And so, this is not continuous.Not...Not continuous.And let's think about another scenario.Let's think about a scenario...And actually, maybe let's think about a scenariowhere the limit...The two-sided limit doesn't even exist.So, there are my axes, x and y.And let's say it's doing something like this.Let's say it's doing something like this,and that it does something like this and goes like that.And let's say that this right over here is our c.And so let's see, this is f of c right over here.That is...Lemme draw a little bit neater.That is f of c.And it does look like the limit,as x approaches c from the left,so from values less than c,it does look like that is approaching f of c.But if we look at the limitas x approaches c from the right,that looks like it's approaching some other value.That looks like it's approaching this value right over here,let's call it L.That's approaching L,and L does not equal f of c.And so in this situation,the two-sided limit doesn't even exist.We're approaching two different valueswhen we approach from the left and from the right.And since so the limit doesn't even exist at c,this is definitely not going to be continuous.And this matches up to our expectationswith our little do-we-have-to-pick-up-the-pencil test.If I have to draw this, I can leave my pencil,it's on the paper, it's on the paper,it's on the paper, it's on the paper.How am I going to continue to draw this function,this graph of the function, without picking up my pencil?Pick it up, put it back down, and then keep drawing it.And so once again, this right over here is not continuous.Both intuitively, by our pick-up-the-pencil definition,and also by this more rigorous definition where,in this case the limit,the two-sided limit at x equals c doesn't even exist,so we're definitely not gonna be continuous.But even when the two-sided limit does exist,but the limit is a different valuethan the value of the function,that will also not be continuous.The only situation that it's going to be continuousis if the two-sided limit approaches the same valueas the value of the function.And if that's true, then we're continuous.If we're continuous, that is going to be true.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-continuity-at-a-point/v/continuity-at-a-point-graphically	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We have the graph of y is equal to g of xright over here, and what I wanna do is I wanna checkwhich of these statements are actually trueand then check them off.And like always, I encourage you to pause the videoand see if you can work through this on your own.So let's look at this first statement.So this first statement says both the limit of g of xas x approaches six from the right-hand sideand the limit as x approaches six from the left-hand sideof g of x exist.All right, so let's first think about the limitof g of x as x approaches six from the right-hand side,as we approach six from values greater than six.So if we look over here, we could say okay,when x is equal to nine, and g of nine is right over there,g of eight is right over here,g of seven is right over here,looks like it's between negative three and negative four,g of 6.5 looks like it's a little bit,it's still between negative three and negative fourbut it's closer to negative three.G of 6.1 is even closer to negative three.G of 6.01 is even closer to negative three,so it looks like the limitfrom the right-hand side does exist.So it looks like this one exists.Now let's see, and I'm just looking at it graphically.That's all they can expect you to doin an exercise like this.Now let's think about the limit as x approaches sixfrom the left-hand side.So I could start anywhere, but let's say when x is equalto three, g of three is a little more than one.G of four looks like there's a little bit less than two.G of five looks like it's close to three.G of 5.5 looks like it's between five and six.G of 5.75 looks like it's approaching nine.And as we get closer and closer,as x gets closer and closer to six from below,from values to the left of six,it looks like we're unbounded, we're approaching infinity.And so technically, we would say this limit does not exist.So this one does not exist.So I won't check this one off.Some people say the limit is approaching infinity,but that technically is,infinity is not a value that you can sayit is approaching in the classical formal definitionof a limit.So for these purposes, we would just saythis does not exist.Now let's see, they say the limit as x approaches sixof g of x exists.Well, the only way that the limit existsis if both the left, if both the left, the left,and the right limits exist and they approach the same thing.We'll, our limit as x approaches six from the negative sideor from the left-hand side, I guess I could say,does not even exist.So this cannot be true.So that's not gonna be true.The first one's not gonna be true.G is defined as x equals six.So at x equals six, it doesn't look like g is defined.Looking at this graph, I can't tell youwhat g of six should be.We have an open circle over here, so g of sixdoes not equal to negative three,and this goes up to infinity,and we have a vertical asymptote actually drawnright over here at x equals six.So g is not defined at x equals six.So I'll rule that one out.G is continuous at x equals six.Well, you can see that it goes up to infinitythen it jumps down, back down here, then it continues.So when you just think about it in commonsense language,it looks very discontinuous.And if you wanna think about it more formally,in order for something to be continuous,the limit needs to exist at that value.The function needs to be defined at that value,and the value of the function needs to be equalto the value of the limitand neither of these, the first two conditions are trueand so these can't even equal each other because neitherof these exist.So this is not continuous at x equals sixand so the only think I can check here is none of the above.Let's do another one of these.So the first statement, both the right-handand the left-hand limit exists as x approaches three.So let's think about it.So x equals three is where we have this littlediscontinuity here, this jump discontinuity.So let's approach, let's go from the positive,from values larger than three.So when x is equal to five, g of five is a little bitmore negative than negative three.G of four is between negative two and negative three.G of 3.5 is getting a bit closer to negative two.G of 3.1, it's getting even closer,closer to negative two.G of 3.01 is even closer to negative two.So it looks like this limit right over here,well, I'm circling the wrong one,it looks like this limit exists.In fact, it looks like it is approaching negative two.So this right over here is equal to negative two.The limit of g of x as x approaches threefrom the right-hand side,and I'll just think about it from the left-hand side.So I can start here.G of one, looks like it's a little bitgreater than negative one.G of two, it's less than one.G of 2.5 is between one and two.G of 2.9 looks like it's a little bit less than two.G of 2.99 is getting even closer to two.G of 2.99999 would be even closer to twoso it looks like this thing right over hereis approaching two.So both of these limits, the limit from the rightand the limit from the left exist.The limit of g of x as x approaches three exists.So these are the one-sided limit.This is the actual limit.Now in order for this to exist, both the rightand left-handed limits need to existand they need to approach the same value.Well, this first statement,we saw that both of these exist but they aren't approachingthe same value.From the left, we are, or sorry,from the right, we are approaching,we are approaching negative two.And from the left, we are approaching two.So this limit does not exist.So I will not check that out or I will not check that box.G is defined at x equals three.Well, when x equals three, we see a solid dotright over there.And so it is indeed defined.It is indeed defined there.G is continuous at x equals three.Well, in order for g to be continuous at x equals three,the limit must exist there.It must be defined there,and the value of the function thereneeds to be equal to the value of the limit.Well, the function is defined there,but the limit doesn't exist thereso it cannot be continuous.It cannot be continuous there.So I would cross that out.And I can't click, I wouldn't click none of the abovebecause I've already checked something,or I've actually checked two things already.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-continuity-over-an-interval/v/continuity-over-an-interval	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois explore continuity over an interval.But to do that, let's refresh our memoryabout continuity at a point.So we say that fis continuouswhenx is equal to c,if and only if,so I'm gonna make these two-way arrows right over here,the limitof f of xas x approaches cis equal to f of c.And when we first introduced this,we said, hey, this looks a little bit technical,but it's actually pretty intuitive.Think about what's happening.The limit as x approaches c of f of x,so let's say that f of x as x approaches cis approaching some value.So if we approach,if we approach from the left,we're getting to this value.If we approach from the right, we're getting this value.Well, in order for the function to be continuous,if I had to draw this function without picking up my pen,well, the value of the function at that pointshould be the same as the limit.This is really just a more rigorous way of describingthis notion of not having to pick up your pencil,this notion of connectedness,that you don't have any jumpsor any discontinuities of any kind.So with that out the way,let's discuss continuity over intervals.Let me delete this really fast,so I have space to work with.So we say, so I'm gonna first talk about an open interval,and then we're gonna talk about a closed intervalbecause a closed interval gets a little bit more involved.So we say fis continuousover an open interval from a to b.So the parentheses instead of brackets,this shows that we're not including the endpoint.So this would be all of the points between x equals aand x equals b,but not equaling x equals a and x equals b.So f is continuous over this open interval,if and only if,if and only if,f is continuous,f is continuousoverevery point in,over every pointinthe interval.So let's do a couple of examples of that.So let's say we're talking about the open intervalfrom negative sevento negative five.Is f continuous over that interval?Let's see, we're going from negative sevento negative five,and there's a couple of ways you could do it.There's the not-so-mathematically-rigorous way,where you could say, hey, look, if I start here,I can get all the way to negative fivewithout having to pick up my pencil.If you wanted to do more rigorouslyand you actually had the definition of the function,you might be able to do a proof,that for any of these points over the interval,that the limit as x approaches any one of these pointsof f of x is equal to the value of the functionat that point.It's harder to do when you only have a graph.When you only have a graph,you can only just do it by inspection,and say, okay, I can go from that point to that pointwithout picking up my pencil,so I feel pretty good about it.Now let's do another interval.Let's say the, so let me put a check mark here,that is continuous.Let's think about the interval from negative twoto positive one, the open interval.So this is interesting because the functionat negative two is up here.And so if you really wanted to start at negative two,you would have to start here and then jump immediately downas soon as you get slightly larger than negative twoand then keep going.But this is an open interval,so we're not actually concernedwith what exactly happens at negative two,we're concerned what happens when we areall the numbers larger than negative two.So we would actually start right over here,and then we would go to one.And once again, based on the intuitiveI didn't have to pick up my pen idea,this function would be continuousover this,over this interval.So what's an example of an intervalwhere the function would not be continuous?Well, think about the interval from,well, this is a pretty straightforward one,the open interval from three to five.The function is here when x is equal to three.But if we wanted to get to five,it looks like we're asymptoting,it looks like we're asymptoting up towards infinityand we just keep on going for a very long time.And then we would have to pick up our pencil and jump over,and then we would come back down right over here.And so here we are not continuous over that interval.So now let's think about the more,the slightly more involved interval.The slightly more involved caseis when you have a closed interval.F is continuousover the closed interval from a to b.So this includes not just the points between a and b,but the endpoints as well,if and only if,f iscontinuousover the open intervaland the one-sided limits.Let me right this.Andthe limitas x approaches afrom the rightof f of xis equal to f of a,and the limitas x approaches bfrom the left,from the left of f of xis equal to f of b.Now what's going on here?Well, it's just saying that the one-sided limit,when you're operating within the Interval,has to approach the same value as the function.So for example, if we said the closed intervalfrom negative seven to negative five,well, this one is still reasonable,you know, just based on the picking up your pencil thing.You don't have to pick up your pencil.And what you would do is at the endpoint,and at negative seven,this function is just plain old continuous,but if it wasn't defined over here,it could still be continuous because you would dothe right-handed limit towards it.And you'd say, okay, the right-handed limitis equal to the value of the function.And then at this endpoint, at the second endpoint,you'd say, okay, the left-handed limitis equal to the function, even if it wasn't defined here,even if the two-sided limit were not defined.And so we could actually look at an example of that.If we were looking atthe interval from the closed,and you could have one side open, one side closed,but let's just do the closed interval from negative threeto negative two.So notice I did not have to pick up my pencil.I'm including negative three,and I'm getting all the way to negative two.If you knew the analytic definition of this function,you could prove that, hey, the limit at any of these pointsinside, between negative three and negative two,is equal to the value of the function.Negative three, the function is clearly, at negative three,the function is just plain old continuous.The two-sided limit approaches the value of the function.But at negative two, the two-sided limit does not exist.When you approach from the left,it looks like you're approaching zero.F of x is equal to zero.When you approach from the right,it looks like f of x is approaching negative three.So even though the two-sided limit does not exist,we can still be goodbecause the left-handed limit does exist.And the left-handed limit is approachingthe value of the function.So we actually are continuous over that interval.But then if we did the interval,if we did the closed interval from negative two tonegative two to one,pause the video and think about,based on what we just talked about,are we continuous over this interval?Well, we're going from negative twoto one,and negative two is the lower bound.So is this right over here,is this right over here true?Is the limit as we approach negative two from the right,is that the same thing as f of negative two?Well, the limit as we approach from the rightseems to be approaching negative three,and f of negative two is zero.So this limit does not, this, this,these two things, the limit as we approach from the rightand the value of the function are not the same.And so we do not have that, I guess you could saythat one-sided (laughs) continuity at negative two.And that also makes sense.If I start at negative two,let me do this in a color you can see,if I start at negative twoand I want to go the rest of the interval to one,I have to pick up my pencil.Pick up my pencil, go here, and then keep on going.So this is, we are not continuous over that interval.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-continuity-over-an-interval/v/functions-continuous-on-all-numbers	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Which of the following functionsare continuous for all real numbers?So let's just remind ourselveswhat it means to be continuous.What a continuous function looks like.So, a continuous function,let's see, that's my y-axis,that is my x-axis.A function is going to be continuous over some interval.If it just has,doesn't have any jumps or discontinuitiesover that, or gaps over that interval,so if it's connectedand it for sure has to be defined over that intervalwithout any gaps,so for example,a continuous function could look something like this.This function,let me make that line a little bit thicker,so this function right over here is continuous.It is connected over this interval,the interval that we can see.Now, examples of discontinuous functionsover an interval, or non-continuous functions,well, they would have gaps of some kind.They could have some type of an asymptotic discontinuityso something like that,that makes it discontinuous.They could havea jump of discontinuity,something like that.They could just have a gapwhere they're not defined,so they could have a gap where they're not defined,or maybe they actually are defined there,but it's removable discontinuity,so all of these are examples of discontinuous functions.Now, if you want the more mathy understanding of thatand we've looked at this before,we say that a function f is continuous,continuous at somevalue, x equals a,if and only if,draw my little two-way arrows here,say if and only if the limitof f of x as x approaches ais equal to the value of the function at a,so once again, in order to be continuous there,you at least have to be defined there.Now, when you look at these, the one thing that jumps outat me, in order to be continuous for all real numbers,you have to be defined for all real numbersand g of x is not defined for all real numbers.It's not defined for negative values of x,and so, we wouldrule this one out,so let's think about f of x equals e to the x.It is defined for all real numbers,and as we'll see,most of the common functions that you've learned in math,they don't have these strange jumps or gapsor discontinuities.Some of them do,functions like 1 over xand things like that,but things like e to the x, it doesn't have any of those.We could graph e to the x.E to the x looks something like,e to the x looks something like this,it's defined for all real numbers,there's no jumps or gaps of any kindand so,this f of x is continuousfor all real numbersand f only.Now, I didn't do a very rigorous proof.You could if you like,but for the sake of this exercise,it's really more of getting this intuitive senseof like, look, e to the x is defined for all real numbersand so,and there's no jumps or gaps hereso it's reasonable to say that it's continuousbut you could do a more rigorous proof if you likeas well.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-continuity-over-an-interval/v/functions-continuous-on-specific-numbers	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Which of the following functionsare continuous at x equals three?Well, as we said in the previous video,in the previous example,in order to be continuous at a point,you at least have to be defined at that point.We saw our definition of continuity,f is continuous at a, if and only if,the limit of f as x approaches a is equal to f of a.So, over here, in this case,we could say that a function is continuousat x equals three, so f is continuous at x equals three,if and only if the limit as x approaches three of f of x,is equal to f of three.Now let's look at this first function right over here.Natural log of x minus three.Well, try to evaluate it, and it's not an f now,it's g, try to evaluate g of three.G of three, let me write it here,g of three is equal to the natural log of zero.Three minus three.This is not defined.You can't raise e to any power to get to zero.You can try to go to, you could say, negative infinity,but that's not, this is not defined.And so, if this isn't even defined at x equals three,there's no way that it's going to be continuousat x equals three, so we could rule this one out.Now f of x is equal to e to the x minus three.Well this is just a shifted over version of e to the x.This is defined for all real numbers,and as we saw in the previous example,it's reasonable to say it's continuous for all real numbers,and you could even do this little test here.The limit of e to the x minus three as x approaches three,well that is going to be, that is going to bee to the three minus three, or e to the zero, or one.And so f is the only one that is continuous.And once again, it's good to think aboutwhat's going on here visually, if you like.Both of these are, you could think of them,this is a shifted over version of ln of x,this is a shifted over version of e to the x,and so if we like, we could draw ourselves some axes,so that's our y-axis, this is our x-axis,and actually, let me draw some points here.So that's one, that is one, that is two, three,two, and three, and let's see,I said these are shifted over versions,so actually, this is maybe not the best way to draw it,so let me draw it, this is one, two, three,four, five, and six.And on this axis, I won't make 'em on the same scale,let's say this is one, two, three.I'm gonna draw one, two, three,I'm gonna draw a dotted line right over here.So g of x, ln of x minus threeis gonna look something like this.If you put three in it, it's not defined,if you put four in it, ln of four,well, that's gonna, sorry, ln of four minus one,so that's gonna be ln of four minus three,is actually let me just draw a table here,I know I'm confusing you.So, if I say x and I say g of x,so at three, you're undefined.At four, this is ln of one, ln of one,which is equal to zero, so it's right over there.So g of x is gonna look something like, something like that.And so you can see at three,you have this discontinuity there,it's not even defined to the left of three.Now f of x is a little bit more straightforward.If you have, so e to the three is going to be,sorry, f of three is going to be e to the three minus three,or e to the zero, so it's going to be one,so it's gonna look something like this,it's gonna look something,something like, like that.There's no jumps, there's no gaps,it is going to be continuous, and frankly,all real numbers so for sure it's goingto be continuous at three.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-removing-discontinuities/v/defining-a-function-at-a-point-to-make-it-continuous	khanacademy	video	:00The function, f of x is equal to 6x squared plus 18x plus 12over x squared minus 4, is not definedat x is equal to positive or negative 2.And we see why that is, if x is equal to positive or negative 2then x squared is going to be equal to positive 4,and 4 minus 4 is 0, and then we'regoing to have a 0 in the denominator.And that's not defined.We don't know what that happens when you divide-- well we'venever defined what happens when you divide by 0.So they say, what value should be assigned to f of negative 2to make f of x continuous at that point?So to think about that, let's tryto actually simplify f of x.So f of x-- I'll just rewrite it-- is equal to-- Actually letme just start simplifying right from the get go.So in the numerator I can factor out a 6out of every one of those terms.So it's 6 times x squared plus 3xplus 2 over-- and the denominator, thisis a difference of squares.This is x plus 2 times x minus 2.And then we can factor this expression up here.So this is going to be equal to 6 times--let me do it a different color.So we think of two numbers and if I take their productI get 2.If I take their sum I get 3.The most obvious one is 2 and 1.So this is 6 times x plus 2 times x plus 1.When you take the product there you'llget x squared plus 3x plus 2, and then allof that over x plus 2 times x minus 2.Now, if we know that x does not equal negative 2.Then we can divide both the numerator and the denominatorby x plus 2.The reason why I'm making that constraintis that if x were to be equal to negative 2then x plus 2 is going to be equal to 0.And you won't be able to do that.You can't.We don't know what it means divide something by 0.So we could say that this is goingto be equal to-- so we can divide the numeratorand denominator by x plus 2 but we have to assume that x is notequal to negative 2.So this is equal to 6 times-- we're going divided by x plus 2in the numerator, x plus 2 in the denominator--so it's going to be 6 times x plus 1 over x minus 2.And we have to put the constraint herebecause now we've changed it.Now this expression over here is actuallydefined at x equals negative 2.But in order to be equivalent to the original functionwe have to constrain it.So we will say for x not equal to negative 2.And it's also obvious that x can't be equal to 2 here.This one also isn't defined at positive 2because you're dividing by 0.So you could say, for x does not equal to positive or negative2 if you want to make it very explicit.But they ask us, what could we assign f of negative 2to make the function continuous at the point?Well the function is completely equivalent to this expressionexcept that the function is not defined at x equals negative 2.So that's why we have to put that constraint hereif we wanted this to be the same thing as our original function.But if we wanted to re-engineer the function so itis continuous at that point then we justhave to set f of x equal to whatever this expression wouldhave been when x is equal to negative 2.So let's think about that.Let's think about that.So 6 times negative 2 plus 1 over negative 2 minus 2is equal to-- this is 6 times negative 1.So it's negative 6 over negative 4, which is equal to 3/2.So if we redefine f of x, if we say f of x is equal to 6xsquared plus 18x plus 12 over x squared minus 4.For x not equal positive or negative2, and it's equal to 3/2 for x equals negative 2.Now this function is going to be the exact same thingas this right over here.This f of x, this new one.This new definition-- this extended definitionof our original one-- is now equivalent to this expression,is equal to 6 times x plus 1 over x minus 2.But just to answer their question,what value should be assigned to f of negative 2to make f of x continuous to that point?Well f of x should be-- or f of negative 2 should be 3/2.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-infinite-limits/v/introduction-to-infinite-limits	khanacademy	video	"- [Instructor] In a previous video, we explored the graphs:00of Y equals one over X squared and one over X.In a previous video we've looked at these graphs.This is Y is equal to one over X squared.This is Y is equal to one over X.And we explored what's the limitas X approaches zero in either of those scenarios.And in this left scenario we sawas X becomes less and less negative,as it approaches zero from the left hand side,the value of one over X squared is unboundedin the positive direction.And the same thing happens as we approach X from the right,as we become less and less positivebut we are still positive,the value of one over X squared becomesunbounded in the positive direction.So in that video, we just said, ""Hey,""one could say that this limit is unbounded.""But what we're going to do in this video isintroduce new notation.Instead of just saying it's unbounded,we could say, ""Hey, from both the left and the rightit looks like we're going to positive infinity"".So we can introduce this notation of saying,""Hey, this is going to infinity"",which you will sometimes see used.Some people would call this unbounded,some people say it does not existbecause it's not approaching some finite value,while some people will use this notationof the limit going to infinity.But what about this scenario?Can we use our new notation here?Well, when we approach zero from the left,it looks like we're unbounded in the negative direction,and when we approach zero from the right,we are unbounded in the positive direction.So, here you still could not saythat the limit is approaching infinitybecause from the right it's approaching infinity,but from the left it's approaching negative infinity.So you would still say that this does not exist.You could do one sided limits here,which if you're not familiar with,I encourage you to review it on Khan Academy.If you said the limit of one over Xas X approaches zero from the left hand side,from values less than zero,well then you would look at this right over here and say,""Well, look, it looks like we're goingunbounded in the negative direction"".So you would say this is equal to negative infinity.And of course if you said the limit as X approaches zerofrom the right of one over X, well hereyou're unbounded in the positive directionso that's going to be equal to positive infinity.Let's do an example problem from Khan Academybased on this idea and this notation.So here it says, consider graphs A, B, and C.The dashed lines represent asymptotes.Which of the graphs agree with this statement,that the limit as X approaches 1 of H of Xis equal to infinity?Pause this video and see if you can figure it out.Alright, let's go through each of these.So we want to think about what happens at X equals one.So that's right over here on graph A.So as we approach X equals one,so let me write this, so the limit,let me do this for the different graphs.So, for graph A, the limit as x approaches onefrom the left, that looks likeit's unbounded in the positive direction.That equals infinity and the limitas X approaches one from the right,well that looks like it's going to negative infinity.That equals negative infinity.And since these are going in two different directions,you wouldn't be able to say thatthe limit as X approaches onefrom both directions is equal to infinity.So I would rule this one out.Now let's look at choice B.What's the limit as X approaches one from the left?And of course these are of H of X.Gotta write that down.So, of H of X right over here.Well, as we approach from the left,looks like we're going to positive infinity.And it looks like the limit of H of Xas we approach one from the right isalso going to positive infinity.And so, since we're approaching you could saythe same direction of infinity, you could say this for B.So B meets the constraints, butlet's just check C to make sure.Well, you can see very clearly X equals one,that as we approach it from the left,we go to negative infinity,and as we approach from the right,we got to positive infinity.So this, once again, would not be approachingthe same infinity.So you would rule this one out, as well."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-infinite-limits/v/infinite-limits-and-asymptotes	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois use the online graphing calculator Desmos,and explore the relationship between verticaland horizontal asymptotes, and think abouthow they relate to what we knowabout limits.So let's first graph two over x minus one,so let me get that one graphed,and so you can immediately see that something interestinghappens at x is equal to one.If you were to just substitute x equals oneinto this expression, you're going to gettwo over zero, and whenever you get a non-zero thing,over zero, that's a good sign that you mightbe dealing with a vertical asymptote.In fact we can draw that vertical asymptoteright over here at x equals one.But let's think about how that relates to limits.What if we were to explore the limit as x approaches oneof f of x is equal to two over x minus one,and we could think about it from the leftand from the right, so if we approach onefrom the left, let me zoom in a little bitover here, so we can see as we approach from the leftwhen x is equal to zero, the f of xwould be equal to negative two,when x is equal to point five, f of xis equal to negative of four, and then it just getsmore and more negative the closer we getto one from the left.I could really, so I'm not even that close yetif I get to let's say 0.91, I'm still nine hundredthsless than one, I'm at negative 22.222, already.And so the limit as we approach one from the leftis unbounded, some people would sayit goes to negative infinity, but it's reallyan undefined limit, it is unboundedin the negative direction.And likewise, as we approach from the right,we get unbounded in the positive infinity directionand technically we would say that that limitdoes not exist.And this would be the case when we're dealingwith a vertical asymptote like we see over here.Now let's compare that to a horizontal asymptotewhere it turns out that the limitactually can exist.So let me delete these or just erase them for now,and so let's look at this functionwhich is a pretty neat function, I made it upright before this video startedbut it's kind of cool looking, but let's thinkabout the behavior as x approaches infinity.So as x approaches infinity, it looks like our y valueor the value of the expression, if we said yis equal to that expression, it looks likeit's getting closer and closer and closer to three.And so we could say that we have a horizontal asymptoteat y is equal to three, and we could alsoand there's a more rigorous way of defining it,say that our limit as x approaches infinityis equal of the expression or of the function,is equal to three.Notice my mouse is covering it a little bitas we get larger and larger, we're gettingcloser and closer to three,in fact we're getting so close now, well hereyou can see we're getting closer and closerand closer to three.And you could also think about what happensas x approaches negative infinity and hereyou're getting closer and closer and closerto three from below.Now one thing that's interesting about horizontalasymptotes is you might see that the functionactually can cross a horizontal asymptote.It's crossing this horizontal asymptotein this area in between and even as we approach infinityor negative infinity, you can oscillatearound that horizontal asymptote.Let me set this up, let me multiply this times sine of x.And so there you have it, we are now oscillatingaround the horizontal asymptote,and once again this limit can existeven though we keep crossing the horizontal asymptote,we're getting closer and closer and closer to itthe larger x gets.And that's actually the key difference betweena horizontal and a vertical asymptote.Vertical asymptotes if you're dealing with a function,you're not going to cross it, while with a horizontalasymptote, you could, and you are just gettingcloser and closer and closer to itas x goes to positive infinity or as xgoes to negative infinity.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-infinite-limits/v/unbounded-limits-graphical	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We're asked to select the correct description.It looks like all the descriptions deal withwhat is the limit of f of x as we approach sixfrom either the right hand side or from the left hand side,so let's think about that.So first let me just do the left hand side.So the limit of f of xas we approach six from the left hand side,what is this going to be equal to?So as we approach from the left hand sidewe can see f of four is a little under two,f of five looks like it's around three,f of 5.5 looks like it's a lot higher,f of 5.75 even is just going off the charts,so it looks like this is going unboundedin the positive direction, so we could saythat this right over here is positive infinity,and if we were to think about the limit of f of xas we approach six from the right side,what is this going to be?Well here, f of seven, it's negative,f of 7.5 is even more negative,f of 6.5 is even more negative,f of 6.1 is way more negative than that,f of 6.01 would be even more negative than that.So it looks like this is unboundedin the negative direction, so this is negative infinity.so let's see which of our choices match up to that.so the way they listed it, they listed the limitfrom the right direction first, so that's this one,so the limit of f of x as x approaches sixfrom values greater than six, we have negative infinity,so that is these two choices, these two choices say that,so we're gonna rule out those two choices.And then we think about as we approach six from the lefthand side, we see that we go to positive infinity,and that is this choice right over here,so we rule out that one, and that is what we will pick.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-infinite-limits/v/unbounded-limits-algebraic-1	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let f of x be equal to negative oneover x minus one squared.Select the correct description of the one-sided limitsof f at x equals one.And so we can see, we have a bunch of choiceswhere we're approaching x from the right-hand sideand we're approaching x from the left-hand side.And we're trying to figure out do we get unboundedon either of those, in the positive,towards positive infinity or negative infinity.And there's a couple of ways to tackle it.The most straightforward, well,let's just consider each of these separately.So we can think about the limit of f of xas x approaches one from the positive directionand limit of f of x as x approaches one,as x approaches one from the left-hand side.This is from the right-hand side.This is from the left-hand side.So I'm just gonna make a table and try out some valuesas we approach, as we approach one from the different sides,x, f of x, and I'll do the same thing over here.So, we are going to have our x and have our f of xand if we approach one from the right-hand side here,that would be approaching one from above,so we could try 1.1, we could try 1.01.Now f of 1.1 is negative one over 1.1 minus one squared.So see this denominator here is going to be .1 squared.So this is going to be, this is going to be 0.01,and so this is going to be negative 100.So let me just write that down.That's going to be negative 100.So if x is 1.01, well, this is going to benegative one over 1.01 minus one squared.Well, then this denominator this is going to be,this is the same thing as 0.01 squared,which is the same thing as 0.0001, 1/10000.And so the negative one 1/10000is going to be negative 10,000.So, let's just write that down, negative 10,000.And so this looks like, as we get closer,'cause notice, as I'm going here I am approaching onefrom the positive direction,I'm getting closer and closer to one from aboveand I'm going unbounded towards negative infinity.So this looks like it is negative infinity.Now we can do the same thing from the left-hand side.I could do 0.9, I could do 0.99.Now 0.9 is actually also going to get me negative 100'cause 0.9 minus one is going to be negative .1but then when you square it the negative goes awayso you get a .01 and then one divided by that is 100but you have the negative, so this is also negative 100.And if you don't follow those calculations, I'll do it,let me do it one more time just so you see it clearly.This is going to be negative one over,so now I'm doing x is equal to 0.99,so I'm getting even closer to one,but I'm approaching from below from the left-hand side.So this is going to be 0.99 minus one squared.Well, 0.99 minus one is, is going to be negative 1/100,so this is going to be negative 0.01 squared.When you square it the negative goes awayand you're left with 1/10000.So this is going to be 0.0001and so when you evaluate this you get 10,000.So that, or sorry, you get negative 10,000.So in either case, regardless of which directionwe approach from, we are approaching negative infinity.So that is this choice right over here.Now there's other ways you could have tackled thisif you just look at, kind of,the structure of this expression here,the numerator is a constant,so that's clearly always going to be positive.Let's ignore this negative for the time being.That negative's out front.This numerator, this one is always going to be positive.Down here, we're taking at x equals one,while this becomes zero and the whole expressionbecomes undefined, but as we approach one,x minus one could be positive or negativeas we see over here, but then when we square it,this is going to become positive as well.So the denominator is going to be positivefor any x other than one.So positive divided by positive is gonna be positivebut then we have a negative out front.So this thing is going to be negativefor any x other than one,and it's actually not defined at x equals one.And so you could, from that, you could deduce,well, okay then, we can only go to negative infinitythere's actually no way to get positive valuesfor this function.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-infinite-limits/v/unbounded-limits-algebraic-2	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] So we're told that f of xis equal to x over one minus cosine of x minus two,and they ask us to select the correct descriptionof the one-sided limits of f at x equals two.And we see that right at x equals two,if we try to evaluate f of two,we get two over one minus cosineof two minus two,which is the same thing as cosine of zero,and cosine of zero is just one,and so one minus one is zero,and so the function is not defined at x equals two,and that's why it might be interesting to find the limitas x approaches two, and especially the one-sided limit.And the one-sided limit.Well, we'll obviously leave it at thatso let's try to approach this.So there's actually a couple of ways you could do it.There is one way you could do this without a calculatorby just inspecting what's going on here,and thinking about the properties of the cosine function,and if that inspires you, pause the video and work it out,and I will do that at the end of this video.The other way, if you have a calculatoris to do it with a little bit of a tablelike we've done in other example problems.So if we think about x approaching twofrom the positive direction, well then.We can make a little table herewhere you have x, and then you have f of x.And so for approaching two from values greater than two,you could have 2.1,2.01.Now the reason why I said calculators,these aren't trivial to evaluatebecause this would be what, 2.1over 1 minus cosine of,2.1 minus two is 0.1.I do not know what cosine of 0.1 is without a calculator.I do know that cosine of zero is oneso this is very, very close to one without getting to one,and it's going to be less than one.Cosine is never going to be greater than one.The cosine function is bounded between negative oneis less than cosine of x.I'll just write the x, then I don't need the parenthesis.Which is less than one.The cosine function just oscillates between these two valuesso this, this thing is gonna be approaching onebut it's going to be less than one.It definitely cannot be greater than one,and that's actually a good hintfor how you can just explore the structure here,and then you could say, ""All right, 2.01.""Well, that's going to be 2.01""over one minus""cosine of 0.01.""And this is going to even closer to onewithout being one but it's going to be less than one.No matter what, cosine of anythingis going to be between negative one and one,and it could even be including those thingsbut as we approach two,this thing is going to approach one,I guess you could say approach one from below.And so you can start to make some intuitions here.If it's approaching from below, this thing over here,this whole expression is going to be positive,and as we approach x equals two.Well, the numerator is positive.It's approaching two.The denominator is positive so this whole thinghas to be approaching a positive valueor it could become unboundedin the positive direction as we'll see,this is unbounded because this thingis even closer to one than this thing,and you would see that if you have a calculatorbut needless to say, this is going to be unboundedin the positive direction so we're going to be goingtowards positive infinity so these two choices have that,and we can make the exact same argument as we approach xin the negative or from below,as we approach two from below, I should say.So that's x, and that is f of x,and once again, I don't have a calculator in front of me.You could evaluate these things at a calculator,and become very clear that these are positive,and as we get closer to,they become even larger and larger positive values,and the same thing would happen if you did 1.9,and if you did 1.99because here, you'd be 1.9 over one minus cosine.Now here, you'd have 1.9 minus twoso this would be negative 0.1.Let me scroll over a little bit.The second one would be 1.99over one minus cosineof negative 0.01.And cosine of negative 0.1is the same thing as cosine of 0.1.Cosine of negative 0.01is the same thing as cosine of 0.01.So these two things, this is going to be equal to that.That is going to be equal to that.And once again, we're gonna be approaching positive infinityso the only choice where all of that is trueis this first one.Whether we approach two from the right-hand sideor the left-hand side, we're approaching positive infinitybut the other way you could have deduced that is say,""Okay, as we approach two,the numerator is going to be positive'cause two is positive, and then over here,as we approach two,cosine of anything can never be greater than one.It's going to approach one but be less than oneso if this is less than as x approaches two.It becomes one when x is equal to two.Well then, this right over here,one minus something less than one is going to be positiveso you have a positive divided by a positiveso you're definitely going to get positive valuesas you approach two.And we know, and they've already told usthat these are going to be unbounded based on the choicesso you would also pick thatbut you should also feel good about it,that the closer that we get to two,the closer that this value right over here gets to zero.And the closer that this value gets to zero,the closer we get to one.The closer we get to one, the smaller the denominator gets.And then you divide by smaller and smaller denominators,you're going to become unbounded towards infinity,which is exactly what we see in that first choice."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/introduction-to-limits-at-infinity	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We now have a lot of experience takinglimits of functions, if I'm taking limit of f of x.What we're gonna think about, what does f of x approach as xapproaches some value a?And this would be equal to some limit.Now everything we've done up till nowis where a is a finite value.But when you look at the graphof the function f right over here,you see something interesting happens.As x gets larger and larger, it looks like our function fis getting closer and closer to two.It looks like we have a horizontalasymptote at y equals two.Similarly, as x gets more and more negative,it also seems like we have a horizontal asymptoteat y equals two.So is there some type of notation we can use to think aboutwhat is the graph approaching as x gets much largeror as x gets smaller and smaller?And the answer there is limits at infinity.So if we want to think about what is this graph,what is this function approachingas x gets larger and larger,we can think about the limit of f of xas x approaches positive infinity.So that's the notation, and I'm not goingto give you the formal definition of this right now.There, in future videos, we might do that.But it's this idea, as x gets larger and larger and larger,does it look like that our functionis approaching some finite value,that we have a horizontal asymptote there?And in this situation, it looks like it is.It looks like it's approaching the value two.And for this particular function, the limitof f of x as x approaches negative infinityalso looks like it is approaching two.This is not always going to be the same.You could have a situation, maybe we had,you could have another function.So let me draw a little horizontalasymptote right over here.You could imagine a function that looks like this.So I'm going to do it like that,and maybe it does something wacky like this.Then it comes down, and it does something like this.Here, our limit as x approaches infinity is still two,but our limit as x approaches negative infinity,right over here, would be negative two.And of course, there's many situations where,as you approach infinity or negative infinity,you aren't actually approaching some finite value.You don't have a horizontal asymptote.But the whole point of this video is justto make you familiar with this notation.And limits at infinityor you could say limits at negative infinity,they have a different formal definitionthan some of the limits that we've looked at in the past,where we are approaching a finite value.But intuitively, they make sense,that these are indeed limits.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/functions-with-same-limit-at-inifinity	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The goal of this videois to get an appreciation that you could have many,in fact, you could have an infinite numberof functions that have the same limitas x approaches infinity.So, if we were to make the general statementthat the limit of some function f of x,as x approaches infinity, is equal to three.What I wanna do in this videois show some examples of that.And to show that we can keep creatingmore and more examples, really an infinite numberof examples where that is going to be true.So, for example, we could look at this graph over here.And in other videos, we'll think about why this is the case,but just think about what happens whenyou have very, very large Xs.When you have very, very large Xs,the plus five doesn't matter as much,and so it gets closer and closer to three x squaredover x squared, which is equal to three.And you could see that right over here,it's graphed in this green color.And you can see, even when x is equal to 10,we're getting awfully close to three right over there.Let me zoom out a little bit so you see our axes.So that is three.Let me draw a dotted line at the asymptote.That is y is equal to three, and so you seethe function's getting closer and closeras x approaches infinity.But that's not the only function that could do that,as I keep saying, there's an infinite numberof functions that could do that.You could have this somewhat wild functionthat involves natural logs.That too, as x approaches infinity,it is getting closer and closer to three.It might be getting closer to threeat a slightly slower rate than the one in green,but we're talking about infinity.As x approaches infinity, this thing is approaching three.And as we've talked about in other videos,you could even have things that keeposcillating around the asymptote,as long as they're getting closer and closer and closerto it as x gets larger and larger and larger.So, for example, that function right over there.Let me zoom in.So, let's zoom in.Let's say when x is equal to 14,we can see that they're all approaching three.The purple one is oscillating around it,the other two are approaching three from below.But as we get much larger,let me actually zoom out a ways, and then I'll zoom in.So let's get to really large values.So, actually, even 100 isn't even that largeif we're thinking about infinity.Even a trillion wouldn't be that largeif we're thinking about infinity.But let's go to 200.200 is much larger than numbers we've been looking at.And let me zoom inwhen x is equal to 200, and you can see,we have to zoom in an awfully lot, an awful lot,just to even see that the graphs still aren't quitestabilized around the asymptote,that they are a little bit different than the asymptote.I really zoomed in, I mean look at the scale.This is, each of these are now 100th, each square.And so we've gotten much, much,much closer to the asymptote.In fact, the green function,we still can't tell the difference.You can see the calculation, this is up tothree or four decimal places,we're getting awfully close to three now,but we aren't there.So the green functions got there the fastest,is an argument.But the whole point of this is to emphasize the factthat there's an infinite number of functionsfor which you could make the statement that we made.That the limit of the function as x approaches infinity,in this case, we said that limit is goingto be equal to three, and I just picked three arbitrarily.This could be true for any, for any function.I didn't realize how much I had zoomed in.So let me now go back to the originwhere we had our original expression.So, there we have it, and maybe I can zoom in this way.So there you have it.Limit of any of these, as x approaches infinity,is equal to three.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/limits-at-positive-and-negative-infinity	khanacademy	video	:00So we have f of x equaling 4x to the fifth minus 3x squaredplus 3, all of that over 6x to the fifth minus 100xsquared minus 10.Now, what I want to think about is--what is the limit of f of x, as x approaches infinity?And there are several ways that you could do this.You could actually try to plug in larger and larger numbersfor x and see if it seems to be approaching some value.Or you could reason through this.And when I talk about reasoning through this,it's to think about the behavior of this numeratorand denominator as x gets very, very, very large.And when I'm talking about that, what I'm saying is,as x gets very, very large-- let's justfocus on the numerator.As x gets very, very large, this term rightover here in the numerator-- 4x to the fifth--is going to become a much, much more significantthan any of these other things.Something squaring gets large.But something being raised to the fifth powergets raised that much, much faster.Similarly, in the denominator, this term right over here-,,the highest degree term-- 6x to the fifth--is going to grow much, much, much faster than any of theseother terms.Even though this has 100 as a coefficient or a negative 100as a coefficient, when you take something to the fifth power,it's going to grow so much faster than x squared.So as x gets very, very, very large,this thing is going to approximate 4xto the fifth over 6x to the fifth for a very large, large xOr we could say as x approaches infinity.Now, what could this be simplified to?Well, you have x to the fifth divided by x to the fifth.These are going to grow together.So these you can think of them as canceling out.And so you are left with 2/3.So what you could say is-- the limit of fof x, as x approaches infinity, as x gets larger and largerand larger, all of these other termsaren't going to matter that much.And so it's going to approach 2/3.Now, let's look at the graph and seeif that actually makes sense.What we're actually saying is that wehave a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to 2/3.So lets look at the graph.So right here is the graph.Got it from Wolfram Alpha.And we see, indeed, as x gets larger and larger and larger, fof x seems to be approaching this value that looks rightat around 2/3.So it looks like we have a horizontal asymptoteright over here.Let me draw that a little bit neater.We have a horizontal asymptote right at 2/3.So let me draw it as neatly as I can.So this right over here is y is equal to 2/3.The limit as x gets really, really large,as it approaches infinity, y is getting closer and closerand closer to 2/3.And when we just look at the graph here,it seems like the same thing is happeningfrom the bottom direction, when x approaches negative infinity.So we could say the limit of f of x,as x approaches negative infinity, thatalso looks like it's 2/3.And we can use the exact same logic.When x becomes a very, very, very negative number,as it becomes further and furtherto the left on the number line, the only termsthat are going to matter are going to be the 4x to the fifthand the 6x to the fifth.So this is true for very large x's.It's also true for very negative x's.So we could also say, as x approaches negative infinity,this is also true.And then, the x to the fifth over the x to the fifthis going to cancel out.These are the dominant terms.And we're going to get it equaling 2/3.And once again, you see that in the graph here.We have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to 2/3.We take the limit of f of x as x approaches infinity,we get 2/3.And the limit of f of x as x approaches negative infinityis 2/3.So in general, whenever you do this,you just have to think about whatterms are going to dominate the rest?And focus on those.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/more-limits-at-infinity	khanacademy	video	:00Let's do a few more examples of finding the limit of functionsas x approaches infinity or negative infinity.So here I have this crazy function.9x to the seventh minus 17x to the sixth,plus 15 square roots of x.All of that over 3x to the seventh plus 1,000xto the fifth, minus log base 2 of x.So what's going to happen as x approaches infinity?And the key here, like we've seen in other examples,is just to realize which terms will dominate.So for example, in the numerator,out of these three terms, the 9x to the seventhis going to grow much faster than any of these other terms.So this is the dominating term in the numerator.And in the denominator, 3x to the seventhis going to grow much faster than an x to the fifth term,and definitely much faster than a log base 2 term.So at infinity, as we get closer and closer to infinity,this function is going to be roughly equal to 9xto the seventh over 3x to the seventh.And so we can say, especially since,as we get larger and larger as we get closer and closerto infinity, these two things aregoing to get closer and closer each other.We could say this limit is going to bethe same thing as this limit.Which is going to be equal to the limitas x approaches infinity.Well, we can just cancel out the x to the seventh.So it's going to be 9/3, or just 3.Which is just going to be 3.So that is our limit, as x approaches infinity,in all of this craziness.Now let's do the same with this function over here.Once again, crazy function.We're going to negative infinity.But the same principles apply.Which terms dominate as the absolute value of xget larger and larger and larger?As x gets larger in magnitude.Well, in the numerator, it's the 3x to the third term.In the denominator it's the 6x to the fourth term.So this is going to be the same thing as the limit of 3xto the third over 6x to the fourth, as x approachesnegative infinity.And if we simplified this, this isgoing to be equal to the limit as x approachesnegative infinity of 1 over 2x.And what's this going to be?Well, if the denominator, even though it'sbecoming a larger and larger and larger negative number,it becomes 1 over a very, very large negative number.Which is going to get us pretty darn close to 0.Just as 1 over x, as x approaches negative infinity,gets us close to 0.So this right over here, the horizontal asymptotein this case, is y is equal to 0.And I encourage you to graph it, or try it out with numbersto verify that for yourself.The key realization here is to simplify the problemby just thinking about which termsare going to dominate the rest.Now let's think about this one.What is the limit of this crazy functionas x approaches infinity?Well, once again, what are the dominating terms?In the numerator, it's 4x to the fourth, and in the denominatorit's 250x to the third.These are the highest degree terms.So this is going to be the same thing as the limit,as x approaches infinity, of 4x to the fourth over 250xto the third.Which is going to be the same thing as the limit of-- let'ssee, 4, well I could just-- this isgoing to be the same thing as-- well we could divide two hundredand, well, I'll just leave it like this.It's going to be the limit of 4 over 250.x to the fourth divided by x to the third is just x.Times x, as x approaches infinity.Or we could even say this is going to be 4/250 timesthe limit, as x approaches infinity of x.Now what's this?What's the limit of x as x approaches infinity?Well, it's just going to keep growing forever.So this is just going to be, this right over hereis just going to be infinity.Infinity times some number right over hereis going to be infinity.So the limit as x approaches infinity of all of this,it's actually unbounded.It's infinity.And a kind of obvious way of seeing that, right,from the get go, is to realize that the numerator hasa fourth degree term.While the highest degree term in the denominatoris only a third degree term.So the numerator is going to grow far fasterthan the denominator.So if the numerator is growing far fasterthan the denominator, you're goingto approach infinity in this case.If the numerator is growing slower than the denominator,if the denominator is growing far faster than the numerator,like this case, you are then approaching 0.So hopefully you find that a little bit useful.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/limits-with-two-horizontal-asymptotes	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1and I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinityand the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.So let's think about what these are going to be.Well, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive wayis to think about what this function approximately equalsas we get larger and larger and larger x'es.This is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.Still the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinityor negative infinity.Well, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term ---- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.And as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative directionthis x squared term is going to really dominate this oneYou can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.The value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.So this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.This term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.And this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared ---- this is going to be equal to x over ---- if I square something and then take the principle root ---- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something ---- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.This is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of xfor x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.So, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,is as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.Now, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.This is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.Similarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,this is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.Remember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over herebecome very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,as x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.Now, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,x is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.And so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.So let's try to do that.So let's say, that is my y axis,this is my x axis,and we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.We have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,so let's say this right over here is y=1,let me draw that line as dotted line,we're going to approach this thing,and then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.So that might be right over there, y=-1.And if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.So, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.Well that's all just going to be equal to zero.So we have this point, right over here,and we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,so it might look something like this.Let me do it a little bit differently. There you go.I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.That's not the color I wanted to use.So it might look something like that.We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and largerand then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.I'm not drawing it so well.So that right over there is y=f(x).And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more pointsor using some type of graphing calculator or something.But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinityand we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominateas x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptotein the positive direction and this one in the negative.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/limit-at-infinity-involving-trig-undefined	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can figure outwhat the limit of x squared plus one over sine of x isas x approaches infinity.So, let's just think about what's going onin the numerator and then think about what's going onin the denominator.So, the numerator, we have x squared plus one.So, as x gets larger and larger and largeras it approaches infinity, well, we're just squaringit here so this numerator's gonna get even,approach infinity even faster.So, this thing is going to go to infinityas x approaches infinity.Now what's happening to the denominator here?Well, sine of x, we've seen this before.Sine of x and cosine of x are bounded,they oscillate.They oscillate between negative one and one,so negative one is gonna be less than or equal tosine of x which is going to be less than or equal to one.So, this denominator's going to oscillate.So, what does that tell us?Well, we might be tempted to say, well the numerator'sunbound and goes to infinity and the denominator'sjust oscillating between these values here.So maybe the whole thing goes to infinity.But we have to be careful because one,the denominator's going between positiveand negative values.So, the numerator's just going to get moreand more and more positivebeing divided sometimes by a positive value,sometimes by a negative value.So, we're gonna jump between positive and negative.Positive and negative.And then you also have all these crazy asymptotes here.Every time sine of x becomes zero,well then, you're gonna have a vertical asymptote.This thing will not be defined.So you have all these vertical asymptotes.You're gonna oscillate between positive and negativejust larger and larger values.So, this limit does not exist.So, it does not exist.Does not exist.And we can see that graphically.We described it in words,just inspecting this expression,but we can see it graphically if we actuallylooked at a graph of this,which I have right here.And you can see that as x goes towards positive infinity,as x goes to positive infinity,we, depending on which x we are, we're kind of going,we go, we get really large, then we had avertical asymptote than we jump back down andgo really negative, vertical asymptote,up, down, up, down, up, down,the oscillations just get more and more extremeand we keep having these vertical asymptoteson a periodic basis.So it's very clear that this limit does not exist.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-limits-at-infinity/v/limits-infinity-algebra	khanacademy	video	:00- Let's think about the limit of the square rootof 100 + x - the square root of x,as x approaches infinity and I encourageyou to pause this video and try tofigure this out on your own.So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.So first let's just try to think about it,before we try to manipulate this algebraically,in some way.So what happens is xgets really really really really large,as x approaches,as x approaches infinity.While even though this 100is a reasonablya reasonably large number,as x gets really large,Billion, trillion, trillion trillions.Even larger than that.Trillion trillion trillion trillions.You could imagine that the 100,under the radical sign,starts to matter a lot less.As x approaches really really large numbers,the square root of 100 + x is going to beapproximately the same thing as thesquare root of x.So forreally reallylarge large x's,we can reason that the square rootof 100 + x is going to beapproximately equal tothe square root of xand so in that reality,we are going toreally really really large x's.In fact,there's nothing larger,where you can keep increasing x's,then these two things are going to beroughly equal to each other.So it's reasonable to believe,that the limit as x approachesinfinity here,is going to be zero.You're subtracting this,from something that ispretty similar to that,but let's actually dosome algrebraic manipulationto feel better about that,instead of this kind ofhand-wavy argument aboutthe 100 not mattering as much,when x gets really really really largeand so let me re-write this expression.See if we canmanipulate it in interesting ways.So this is100 + x - x.So one thing that might jump out at youwhenever you see one radical,minus another radical like this.Well maybe we can multiplyby its conjugate and somehowget rid of the radicals,or at least transform theexpression in some way,that might be a little more usefulwhen we try to find the limit,as x approaches infinity.So let's just and obviouslywe can't just multiply itby anything arbitrary,in order to not change the valueof this expression,we can only multiply it by one.So let's multiply it by a form of one,but a form of one that helps us,that is essentially made up of its conjugate.So let's multiply thislet's multiply thistimes the square rootof 100 + x+ the square root of x,over the same thing.The square root of100 + x+ the square root of x.Now notice this,of course is exactly equal to oneand the reason why we liketo multiply by conjugates,is that we can take advantageof differences of squares.So this is going to be equal toand our denominator,we're just going to havewe're just going to have thesquare root of 100.Let me write it this way actually.100 + x+ the square root of xand our then our numberator,we have the square rootof 100 + x,minus the square root of xtimes this thing.Times square root of100 + x +the square root of x.Now right over here,we're essentially multiplyingA + B times A - B,will produce a difference of squares.So this is going to be equal tothis top part right over here,is going to be equal tois going to be equal tothis,let me do this in a different color.It's going to be equal tothis thing squaredminus,minus,this thing,minus that thing squared.So what's 100 + x squared?Well that's just 100 + x,100 + xand then what square rootof x squared?Well that's just going to be x.So minus xand we do see that thisis starting to simplify nicely.All of that,over the square rootof 100 + x+ the square root of xand these x'sx - x will just be nothingand so we are left with 100 overthe square root of 100 + x +the square root of x.So we could re-write the original limit,as the limit,the limit as x approaches infinity.Instead of this,we just algebraically manipulated it,to be this.So the limit as x approaches infinityof 100 overthe square root of100 + x+ the square root of xand now it becomes much clearer.We have a fixed numerator.This numerator just stays at 100,but our denominator right over here,is just going to be,it's just going to keep increasing.It's going to be unbounded.So if you're just increasing this denominator,while you keep the numerator fixed,you essentially have a fixed numerator,with an ever-increasing,or a super large,or an infinitely large denominator.So that is going to approach,that is going to approach zero,which is consistent withour original intuition.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-intermediate-value-theorem/v/intermediate-value-theorem	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] What we're gonna cover in this videois the intermediate value theorem.Which, despite some of this mathy language you'll seeis one of the more intuitive theoremspossibly the most intuitive theorem you willcome across in a lot of yourmathematical career.So first I'll just read it outand then I'll interpret it and hopefullywe'll all appreciate that it's pretty obvious.I'm not going to prove it here.But, I think the conceptual underpinning here isit should be straightforward.So the theorem tells us that suppose F is a functioncontinuous at every point of the intervalthe closed interval, so we're including A and B.So it's continuous at every point of the interval A, B.Let me just draw a couple of examplesof what F could look like justbased on these first lines.Suppose F is a function continuous at every pointof the interval A, B.So let me draw some axes here.So that's my Y axis.And this is my X axis.So, one situationif this is A.And this is B.F is continuous at every point of the intervalof the closed interval A and B.So that means it's got to be for sure definedat every point.As well, as to be continuous you haveto defined at every point.And the limit of the function that is recorded at that pointshould be equal to the value of the function of that point.And so the function is definitely going to be definedat F of A.So it's definitely going to have an F of Aright over here.That's right over hereis F of A.Maybe F of B is higher.Although we can look at different cases.So that would be our F of B.And they tell us it is a continuous function.It is a continuous function.So if you're trying to imagine continuous functionsone way to think about it isif we're continuous over an intervalwe take the value of the function atone point of the interval.And, if it's continuous we need to be able toget to the other, the value of the functionat the other point of the intervalwithout picking up our pencil.So, I can do all sorts of thingsand it still has to be a function.So, I can't do something like that.But,as long as I don't pick up my pencilthis is a continuous function.So, there you go.If the somehow the graphI had to pick up my pencil.If I had to do something like thisoops, I got to pick up my pencil do something like that,well that's not continuous anymore.If I had to do something like thisand oops, pick up my pencilnot continuous anymore.If I had to do something likewooo.Whoa, okay, pick up my pencil, go down here,not continuous anymore.So, this is what a continuous functionthat a function that is continuousover the closed interval A, B looks like.I can draw some other examples, in fact,let me do that.So let me drawone.Maybe where F of B is less thanF of A.So it's my Y axis.And this is myX axis.And once again, A and B don't bothhave to be positive,they can both be negative.One could be, A could be negative.B could be positive.And maybe in this situation.And F of A and F of Bit could also be a positive or negative.But let's take a situation where this isF of A.So that, right over there,is F of A.This right over hereis F of B.F of B.And once again we're saying F is acontinuous function.So I should be able to go from F of Ato F of BF of B draw a functionwithout having to pick up my pencil.So it could do something like this.Actually I want to make it go vertical.It could go like thisand then go down.And thendo somethinglike that.So these are both casesand I could draw an infinite number of caseswhere F is a function continuous at every pointof the interval.The closed interval, from A to B.Now, given thatthere's two ways to state the conclusionfor the intermediate value theorem.You'll see it written in one of these waysor something close to one of these ways.And that's why I included both of these.So one way to say it is, wellif this first statement is truethen F will take on every valuebetween F of A and F of Bover the interval.And you see in both of these casesevery interval, sorry, everyevery value between F of Aand F of B.So every value hereis being taken on at some point.You can pick some value.You can pick some value, an arbitrary valueL, right over here.Oh look.L happened right over there.If you pick Lwell, L happened right over there.And actually it also happened thereand it also happened there.And this second bullet point describesthe intermediate value theorem more that way.For any L between the values of F and Aand F of Bthere are exists a number Cin the closed interval from A to Bfor which F of C equals L.So there exists at least one C.So in this casethat would be our C.Over here, there's potentialthere's multiple candidates for C.That could be a candidate for C.That could be a C.So we could say there exists at leastone number.At leastone number, I'll throw that in there,at least one number Cin the interval for which this is true.And, something that might amuse youfor a few minutes istry to draw a function where this firststatement is true.But somehow the second statement isnot true.So, you say, okay, well let's saylet's assume that there's an Lwhere there isn't a C in the interval.Let me try and do that.And I'll draw it big so thatwe can really see how obviousthat we have to take onall of the values between F and Aand F of B is.So,let me draw a big axis this time.So that's my Y axis.And,that is my X axis.And I'll just do the case wherejust for simplicity, that is Aand that is B.And let's saythat this is F of A.So that isF of A.And let's say that thisis F of B.Little dotted line.All right.F of B.And we assume that wewe have a continuous function here.So the graph, I could draw it fromF of A to F of B from this pointto this pointwithout picking up my pencil.From this coordinate A comma F of Ato this coordinate B comma F of Bwithout picking up my pencil.Well, let's assumethat there is some L that we don't take on.Let's say there's some value L right over here.And,and we never take on this value.This continuous function never takes on this valueas we go from X equaling A to X equal B.Let's see if I can draw that.Let's see if I can getfrom hereto herewithout ever essentially crossing this dotted line.Well let's see, I could, wooo,maybe I would a little bit.But gee, how am I gonna get there?Well, without picking up my pencil.Well,well, I really need to cross that line,all right.Well, there you go.I found, we took on the value Land it happened at Cwhich is in that closed interval.So once again, I'm not giving you a proof here.But hopefully you have a good intuitionthat the intermediate value theoremis kind of common sense.The key is you're dealing with a continuous function.If you make its graphif you were to draw it betweenthe coordinates A comma F of Aand B comma F of Band you don't pick up your pencil,which would be true of a continuous function.Well, it's going to take on every valuebetween F of A and F of B.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-intermediate-value-theorem/v/justification-with-the-intermediate-value-theorem-table	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The table gives selected valuesof the continuous function f.All right, fair enough.Can we use the intermediate value theoremto say that the equation f of x equal is equal to zerohas a solution where fouris less than or equal to x is less than or equal to six?If so, write a justification.So, pause this video and see if you can think about thison your own before we do it together.Okay, well let's just visualize what's going onand visually think about the intermediate value theorem.So, if that's my y-axis thereand then let's say that this is my x-axisright over here.We've been given some points over here.We know when x is equal to zero, f of x is equal to zero.Let me draw those.So, we have that point.When x is equal to two,y or f of x, y equals f of xis gonna be equal to a negative two.So, we have a negative two right over there.When x is equal to four, so, three, four,f of x is equal to three.One, two, three.I'm doing it on a slightly different scaleso that I can show everything.And when x is equal to six, so, five, six,f of x is equal to seven.Three, four,five, six, seven.So, right over here.Now, they also tell us that our function is continuous.So, one intuitive way of thinking about continuityis I can connect all of these dotswithout lifting my pencil.So, the function might look,I'm just gonna make up some stuff,it might look something,anything like what I just drew just now.And it could have even wilder fluctuationsbut that is what my f looks like.Now, the intermediate value theoremsays hey, pick a closed interval.And here, we're picking the closed intervalfrom four to six, so let me look at that.So, this is one, two, three, four here,this is six here,so we're gonna look at this closed interval.And the intermediate value theorem tells usthat look, if we're continuous over that closed interval,our function f is gonna take on every valuebetween f of four, which in this case,so, this is f of four, is equal to three,and f of six, which is equal to seven.f of six,which is equal to seven.And so, if someone said hey, is there gonna be a solutionto f of x is equal to, say, five over this interval?Yes.Over this interval, for some x,you're going to have f of x being equal to five.But they're not asking us for an f of xequaling something between these two values.They're asking us for an f of x equaling zero.Zero isn't between f of four and f of six,and so we cannot use the intermediate value theorem here.And so, if we wanted to write it out,we could say f is continuousbut zero is notbetween f of fourand f of six.So, the intermediate value theorem does not apply.All right, let's do the second one.So here they say, can we use the intermediate value theoremto say that there is a value c such that f of c equals zeroand two is less than or equal to cis less than or equal to four?If so, write a justification.We are given that f is continuous, so let write that down.We are giventhat f is continuous,and if you wanna be over that interval,but they're telling us it's continuous in general.And then we can just look at what is the valueof the function at these end points?Our interval goes from two to four,so we're talking about this closed interval right over here.We know that f of twois going to be equal to negative two.We see it on that table.And what's f of four?f of four is equal to three.So, zerois betweenf of two and f of four.And you can see it visually here.There's no way to draw between this point and that pointwithout picking up your pen, without crossing the x-axis,without having to pointwhere your function is equal to zero.And so, we can sayaccording to the intermediate value theorem,there isa value csuch thatf of c is equal to zeroand two is less than or equal to cis less than or equal to four.So, all we're saying is hey, there must be a value c,and the way I drew it here, that c value is right overwhere c is between two and four,where f of c is equal to zero.And this seems all mathyand a little bit confusing sometimesbut it's saying something very intuitive.If I had to go from this point to that pointwithout picking up my pen, I am going to at least crossevery value between f of two and f of four at least once.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-intermediate-value-theorem/v/justification-with-the-intermediate-value-theorem-equation	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let g of x equal one over x.Can we use the intermediate value theoremto say that there is a value c,such that g of c is equal to zero,and negative one is less than or equal to c,is less than or equal to one?If so, write a justification.So in order to even use the intermediate value theorem,you have to be continuous over the intervalthat you care about.And this interval that we care about is from x equalsnegative one to one.And, one over x is not continuous over that interval,it is not defined when x is equal to zero.And so, we could say, no, because,g of x not defined, or I could say not continuous.It's also not defined on every point of the interval,but let's say not continuous over the closed intervalfrom negative one to one.And we could even put in parentheses not defined,at x is equal to zero.All right, now let's start asking the second question.Can we use the intermediate value theorem to saythat the equation g of x is equal to 3/4has a solution where 1 is less than or equal to x,is less than or equal to two?If so, write a justification.All right so first let's look at the interval.If we're thinking about the interval from one to two,well, yeah, our function is going to be continuousover that interval, so we could say g of x is continuouson the closed interval from one to two.And if you wanted to put more justification there,you could say g defined for all real numbers,such that x does not equal zero.I could write g of x defined for all real numberssuch that x does not equal to zero,and you could say rational functions like one over x,are continuous at all points in their domains.That's going really establishing that g of xis continuous on that interval.And then we wanna see what values does g take over,take on at the end point, or actually,these are the end points we're looking at right over here.G of one is going to be equal to one over one is one,and g of two is going to be one over two.So, 3/4 is between g of one and g of two,so by the intermediate value theorem,there must be an x that is in the intervalfrom where it's talking about the interval from one to two,such that g of x is equal to 3/4.And so, yes, we can use the intermediate value theoremto say that the equation g of x is equal to 3/4has a solution, and we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-average-vs-instantaneous-rate-of-change/v/newton-leibniz-and-usain-bolt	khanacademy	video	:00This is a picture of Isaac Newton,super famous British mathematician and physicist.This is a picture of a Gottfried Leibnitz,super famous, or maybe not as famous,but maybe should be, famous German philosopherand mathematician, and he was a contemporary of Isaac Newton.These two gentlemen together were reallythe founding fathers of calculus.And they did some of their-- most of their major workin the late 1600s.And this right over here is Usain Bolt, Jamaican sprinter,whose continuing to do some of his best work in 2012.And as of early 2012, he's the fastest human alive,and he's probably the fastest human that has ever lived.And you might have not made the association with these threegentleman.You might not think that they have a lot in common.But they were all obsessed with the same fundamental question.And this is the same fundamental questionthat differential calculus addresses.And the question is, what is the instantaneous rateof change of something?And in the case of Usain Bolt, how fast is he going right now?Not just what his average speed was for the last second,or his average speed over the next 10 seconds.How fast is he going right now?And so this is what differential calculus is all about.Instantaneous rates of change.Differential calculus.Newton's actual original term for differential calculuswas the method of fluxions, whichactually sounds a little bit fancier.But it's all about what's happening in this instant.And to think about why that is not a super easy problemto address with traditional algebra, let'sdraw a little graph here.So on this axis I'll have distance.I'll say y is equal to distance.I could have said d is equal to distance,but we'll see, especially later on in calculus,d is reserved for something else.We'll say y is equal to distance.And in this axis, we'll say time.And I could say t is equal to time,but I'll just say x is equal to time.And so if we were to plot Usain Bolt's distanceas a function of time, well at time zerohe hasn't gone anywhere.He is right over there.And we know that this gentleman iscapable of traveling 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.So after 9.58 seconds, we'll assumethat this is in seconds right over here,he's capable of going 100 meters.And so using this information, wecan actually figure out his average speed.Let me write it this way, his average speedis just going to be his change in distanceover his change in time.And using the variables that are over here,we're saying y is distance.So this is the same thing as changein y over change in x from this point to that point.And this might look somewhat familiar to youfrom basic algebra.This is the slope between these two points.If I have a line that connects these two points,this is the slope of that line.The change in distance is this right over here.Change in y is equal to 100 meters.And our change in time is this right over here.So our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds.We started at 0, we go to 9.58 seconds.Another way to think about it, the rise over the run you mighthave heard in your algebra class.It's going to be 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.So this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.And the slope is essentially just rate of change,or you could view it as the average rateof change between these two points.And you'll see, if you even just follow the units,it gives you units of speed here.It would be velocity if we also specified the direction.And we can figure out what that is,let me get the calculator out.So let me get the calculator on the screen.So we're going 100 meters in the 9.58 seconds.So it's 10.4, I'll just write 10.4, I'll round to 10.4.So it's approximately 10.4, and then the unitsare meters per second.And that is his average speed.And what we're going to see in a secondis how average speed is differentthan instantaneous speed.How it's different than what the speedhe might be going at any given moment.And just to have a concept of how fast this is,let me get the calculator back.This is in meters per second.If you wanted to know how many meters he's going in an hour,well there's 3,600 seconds in an hour.So he'll be able to go this many meters 3,600 times.So that's how many meters he can,if he were able to somehow keep up that speed in an hour.This is how fast he's going meters per hour.And then, if you were to say how many miles per hour,there's roughly 1600-- and I don't know the exact number,but roughly 1600 meters per mile.So let's divide it by 1600.And so you see that this is roughly a little over 23,about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.So this is approximately, and I'llwrite it this way-- this is approximately 23.5 milesper hour.And relative to a car, not so fast.But relative to me, extremely fast.Now to see how this is different than instantaneous velocity,let's think about a potential plot of his distancerelative to time.He's not going to just go this speed immediately.He's not just going to go as soon as the gun fires,he's not just going to go 23 and 1/2 miles per hour all the way.He's going to accelerate.So at first he's going to start off going a little bit slower.So the slope is going to be a little bit lot lowerthan the average slope.He's going to go a little bit slower,then he's going to start accelerating.And so his speed, and you'll see the slope hereis getting steeper and steeper and steeper.And then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.And so his distance plotted against timemight be a curve that looks something like this.And what we calculated here is justthe average slope across this change in time.What we could see at any given momentthe slope is actually different.In the beginning, he has a slower rateof change of distance.Then over here, then he accelerates over here,it seems like his rate of change of distance, whichwould be roughly-- or you could view itas the slope of the tangent line at that point,it looks higher than his average.And then he starts to slow down again.When you average it out, it gets to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.And I looked it up, Usain Bolt's instantaneous velocity,his peak instantaneous velocity, is actuallycloser to 30 miles per hour.So the slope over here might be 23 whatever miles per hour.But the instantaneous, his fastest pointin this 9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.But you see it's not a trivial thing to do.You could say, OK, let me try to approximate the slope rightover here.And you could do that by saying, OK, well,what is the change in y over the change of x right around this?So you could say, well, let me take some change of x,and figure out what the change of y is around it,or as we go past that.So you get that.But that would just be an approximation,because you see that the slope of this curveis constantly changing.So what you want to do is see whathappens as your change of x gets smallerand smaller and smaller.As your change of x get smaller and smaller and smaller,you're going to get a better and better approximation.Your change of y is going to get smallerand smaller and smaller.So what you want to do, and we'regoing to go into depth into all of this,and study it more rigorously, is youwant to take the limit as delta x approaches0 of your change in y over your change in x.And when you do that, you're goingto approach that instantaneous rate of change.You could view it as the instantaneous slopeat that point in the curve.Or the slope of the tangent line at that point in the curve.Or if we use calculus terminology,we would view that as the derivative.So the instantaneous slope is the derivative.And the notation we use for the derivative is a dy over dx.And that's why I reserved the letter y.And then you say, well, how does thisrelate to the word differential?Well, the word differential is relating--this dy is a differential, dx is a differential.And one way to conceptualize it, thisis an infinitely small change in yover an infinitely small change in x.And by getting super, super small changes in yover change in x, you're able to get your instantaneous slope.Or in the case of this example, the instantaneous speedof Usain Bolt right at that moment.And notice, you can't just put a 0 here.If you just put change in x is zero,you're going to get something that's undefined.You can't divide by 0.So we take the limit as it approaches 0.And we'll define that more rigorouslyin the next few videos.

are likely already familiar with the ideaof a slope of a line.If you're not, I encourage you to review it on Khan Academy,but all it is, it's describing the rate of changeof a vertical variablewith respect to a horizontal variable,so for example, here I have our classic y axisin the vertical direction and x axisin the horizontal direction,and if I wanted to figure out the slope of this line,I could pick two points,say that point and that point.I could say, ""Okay, from this point to this point,what is my change in x?""Well, my change in x would be this distance right over here,change in x,the Greek letter delta, this triangle here.It's just shorthand for ""change,"" so change in x,and I could also calculate the change in y,so this point going up to that point, our change in y,would be this, right over here, our change in y,and then, we would define slope, or we have defined slopeas change in y over change in x,so slope is equal to the rate of changeof our vertical variableover the rate of change of our horizontal variable,sometimes described as rise over run,and for any line, it's associated with a slopebecause it has a constant rate of change.If you took any two points on this line,no matter how far apart or no matter how close together,anywhere they sit on the line,if you were to do this calculation,you would get the same slope.That's what makes it a line,but what's fascinatingabout calculus is we're going to build the toolsso that we can think about the rate of change not justof a line, which we've called ""slope"" in the past,we can think about the rate of change,the instantaneous rate of change of a curve,of something whose rateof change is possibly constantly changing.So for example, here's a curve where the rate of change of ywith respect to x is constantly changing,even if we wanted to use our traditional tools.If we said, ""Okay, we can calculate the average rateof change,"" let's say between this point and this point.Well, what would it be?Well, the average rate of change between this point andthis point would be the slope of the linethat connects them,so it would be the slope of this line of the secant line,but if we picked two different points,we pick this point and this point,the average rate of changebetween those points all of a sudden looks quite different.It looks like it has a higher slope.So even when we take the slopes between two pointson the line, the secant lines,you can see that those slopes are changing,but what if we wanted to ask ourselvesan even more interesting question.What is the instantaneous rate of change at a point?So for example, how fast is y changingwith respect to x exactly at that point,exactly when x is equal to that value.Let's call it x one.Well, one way you could think about it iswhat if we could draw a tangent line to this point,a line that just touches the graph right over there,and we can calculate the slope of that line?Well, that should be the rate of change at that point,the instantaneous rate of change.So in this case,the tangent line might look something like that.If we know the slope of this,well then we could say thatthat's the instantaneous rate of change at that point.Why do I say instantaneous rate of change?Well, think about the video on these sprinters,Usain Bolt example.If we wanted to figure out the speed of Usain Boltat a given instant, well maybe this describes his positionwith respect to time if y was position and x is time.Usually, you would see t as time, but let's say x is time,so then, if were talking about right at this time,we're talking about the instantaneous rate,and this idea is the central idea of differential calculus,and it's known as a derivative,the slope of the tangent line, which you could also viewas the instantaneous rate of change.I'm putting an exclamation markbecause it's so conceptually important here.So how can we denote a derivative?One way is known as Leibniz's notation,and Leibniz is one of the fathers of calculusalong with Isaac Newton,and his notation, you would denote the slopeof the tangent lineas equaling dy over dx.Now why do I like this notation?Because it really comes from this idea of a slope,which is change in y over change in x.As you'll see in future videos,one way to think about the slopeof the tangent line is, well,let's calculate the slope of secant lines.Let's say between that point and that point,but then let's get even closer,say that point and that point,and then let's get even closerand that point and that point,and then let's get even closer,and let's see what happens as the changein x approaches zero,and so using these d's instead of deltas,this was Leibniz's way of saying,""Hey, what happens if my changesin, say, x become close to zero?""So this idea,this is known as sometimes differential notation,Leibniz's notation, is instead of just changein y over change in x, super small changes in yfor a super small change in x,especially as the change in x approaches zero,and as you will see,that is how we will calculate the derivative.Now, there's other notations.If this curve is described as y is equal to f of x.The slope of the tangent lineat that point could be denotedas equaling f prime of x one.So this notation takes a little bit of time getting used to,the Lagrange notation.It's saying f prime is representing the derivative.It's telling us the slope of the tangent linefor a given point,so if you input an x into this function into f,you're getting the corresponding y value.If you input an x into f prime,you're getting the slope of the tangent line at that point.Now, another notation that you'll see less likelyin a calculus class but you might see in a physics classis the notation y with a dot over it,so you could write this is y with a dot over it,which also denotes the derivative.You might also see y prime.This would be more common in a math class.Now as we march forward in our calculus adventure,we will build the tools to actually calculate these things,and if you're already familiar with limits,they will be very useful, as you could imagine,'cause we're really going to be taking the limitof our change in y over change in x as our changein x approaches zero,and we're not just going to be able to figure it outfor a point.We're going to be able to figure out general equationsthat described the derivative for any given point,so be very, very excited."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-average-vs-instantaneous-rate-of-change/v/secant-lines-and-average-rate-of-change	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] So right over herewe have the graph of y is equal to x squared,or at least part of the graph of y is equal to x squared.And the first thing I'd like to tackle isthink about the average rate of changeof y with respect to xover the interval from x equaling 1 to x equaling 3.So let me write that down.We want to know the average rate of changeof y with respect to xover the interval from x going from 1 to 3.And that's a closed interval,where x could be 1, and x could be equal to 3.Well we could do this even without looking at the graph.If I were to just make a table here,where, if this is x, and this is y is equal to x squared,when x is equal to 1, y is equal to 1 squared,which is just 1.You see that right over there.And when x is equal to 3,y is equal to 3 squared, which is equal to 9.And so you can see when x is equal to 3,y is equal to 9.And to figure out the average rate of changeof y with respect to x,you say, ""Okay, well what's my change in x?""Well, we could see very clearlythat our change in x over this intervalis equal to positive 2.Well, what's our change in y over the same interval?Our change in y is equal to ...When x increased by 2 from 1 to 3,y increases by 8, so it's going to be a positive 8.So what is our average rate of change?Well, it's going to be our change in y,or our change in x,which is equal to 8 over 2, which is equal to 4.So that would be our average rate of change.Over that interval, on average,every time x increases by 1, y is increasing by 4.And how did we calculate that?We looked at our change in x,let me draw that here ...We looked at our change in x,and we looked at our change in y,which would be this right over here,and we calculated change in y over change of xfor average rate of change.Now this might be looking fairly familiar to you,because you're used to thinking aboutchange in y over change in xas the slope of a line connecting two points.And that's indeed what we did calculate.If you were to draw a secant line between these two points,we essentially just calculatedthe slope of that secant line.And so the average rate of change between two points,that is the same thing as the slope of the secant line.And by looking at the secant line,in comparison to the curve over that interval,it hopefully gives you a visual intuitionfor what even average rate of change means.Because in the beginning part of the interval,you see that the secant lineis actually increasing at a faster rate,but then as we get closer to 3,it looks like our yellow curveis increasing at a faster rate than the secant line,and then they eventually catch up.And so that's why the slope of the secant lineis the average rate of change.Is it the exact rate of change at every point?Absolutely not.The curve's rate of change is constantly changing.It's at a slower rate of changein the beginning part of this interval,and then it's actually increasing at a higher rateas we get closer and closer to three.So over the interval,the change in y over the change in x is exactly the same.Now one question you might be wondering iswhy are you learning this is in a calculus class?Couldn't you have learned this in an algebra class?The answer is yes.But what's going to be interesting,and is really one of the foundational ideas of calculus iswell what happens as these pointsget closer and closer together?We found the average rate of change between 1 and 3,or the slope of the secant line from (1, 1) to (3, 9).But what instead if you found the slope of the secant linebetween (2, 4) and (3, 9)?So what if you found this slope?But what if you wanted to get even closer?Let's say you wanted to find the slope of the secant linebetween the point(2.5, 6.25)and (3, 9)?And what if you just kept gettingcloser and closer and closer?Well then, the slopes of these secant linesare going to get closer and closerto the slope of the tangent line at x equals 3.And if we can figure out the slope of the tangent line,well then we're in business.Because then we're not talking about average rate of change,we're going to be talking aboutinstantaneous rate of change,which is one of the central ideas,that is the derivative,and we're going to get there soon.But it's really important to appreciatethat average rate of change between two pointsis the same thing as the slope of the secant line.And as those points get closer and closer together,and as the secant line is connectingtwo closer and closer points together,that distance between the points,between the x values of the points approach 0,very interesting things are going to happen."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-average-vs-instantaneous-rate-of-change/v/derivative-as-slope-of-curve	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this videois a few examples that test our intuitionof the derivative as a rate of changeor the steepness of a curveor the slope of a curveor the slope of a tangent line of a curvedepending on how you actually want to think about it.So here it says F prime of fiveso this notation, primethis is another way of saying well what's the derivativelet's estimate the derivative of our function at five.And when we say F prime of five this is the slopeslope of tangent linetangent line at fiveor you could view it as theyou could view it as the rate of changeof Y with respect to Xwhich is really how we define sloperespect to X of our function F.So let's think about that a little bit.We see they put the pointthe point five comma F of five right over hereand so if we want to estimate the slope of the tangent lineif we want to estimate the steepness of this curvewe could try to draw a linethat is tangent right at that point.So let me see if I can do that.So if I were to draw a line starting thereif I just wanted to make a tangentit looks like it would do something like that.Right at that point that looks to beabout how steep that curve isnow what makes this an interesting thing in non-linearis that it's constantly changingthe steepness it's very low here and it gets steeperand steeper and steeper as we move to the rightfor larger and larger X values.But if we look at the point in questionwhen X is equal to five remember F prime of fivewould be if you were estimating itthis would be the slope of this line here.And the slope of this line it looks likefor every time we move one in the X directionwe're moving two in the Y direction.Delta Y is equal to two when delta X is equal to one.So our change in Ywith respect to Xat least for this tangent line herewhich would represent our change in Ywith respect to X right at that pointis going to be equal to two over one, or two.And it's almost estimated, but all of these are way off.Having a negative two derivativewould mean that as we increase our X our Y is decreasing.So if our curve looks something like thiswe would have a slope of negative two.If having slopes in thisa positive of point onethat would be very flat something down herewe might have a slope closer to point one.Negative point one that might be closer on this sidenow we're sloping but very close to flat.A slope of zero, that would be right over here at the bottomwhere right at that moment as we change XY is not increasing or decreasingthe slope of the tangent line right at that bottom pointwould have a slope of zero.So I feel really good about that response.Let's do one more of these.So alright, so they're telling us to comparethe derivative of G at four to the derivative of G at sixand which of these is greaterand like always, pause the videoand see if you can figure this out.Well this is just an exerciselet's see if we were toif we were to make a line that indicates the slope thereyou can do this as a tangent linelet me try to do that.So now that wouldn't, that doesn't do a good jobso right over here atthat looks like aI think I can do a better job than thatno that's too shallow to seenot shallow's not the word, that's too flat.So let me try to reallyokay, that looks pretty good.So that line that I just drewseems to be indicative ofthe rate of change of Y with respect to Xor the slope of that curveor that line you can view it as a tangent lineso we could think about what its slope is going to beand then if we go further down over herethis one is, it looks like it issteeper but in the negative directionso it looks like it is steeper for surebut it's in the negative direction.As we increase, think of it this wayas we increase X one hereit looks like we are decreasing Y by about one.So it looks like G prime of fourG prime of four, the derivative when X is equal to fouris approximately, I'm estimating itnegative onewhile the derivative here when we increase Xif we increase X byif we increase X by oneit looks like we're decreasing Y by close to threeso G prime of sixlooks like it's closer to negative three.So which one of these is larger?Well, this one is less negativeso it's going to be greater than the other oneand you could have done this intuitivelyif you just look at the curvethis is some type of a sinusoid hereyou have right over here the curve is flatyou have right at that momentyou have no change in Y with respect to Xthen it starts to decreasethen it decreases at an even faster ratethen it decreases at a faster ratethen it starts, it's still decreasingbut it's decreasing at slower and slower ratesdecreasing at slower rates and right at that momentyou have your slope of your tangent line is zerothen it starts to increase, increase, so on and so forthand it just keeps happening over and over again.So you can also think about this in a more intuitive way.

[Voiceover] We're told that the tangent line to the graphof function at the the point two comma threepasses through the point seven comma six.Find f prime of two.So whenever you see something like this,it doesn't hurt to try to visualize it.You might want to draw it out or just visualize itin your headbut since you can't get in my head,I will draw it out.So let medraw the information that they are giving us.So that's x axis and that is the y axis.Let's see the relevant points here at two comma threeand seven comma six.So let me go,one, two, three, four,five, six, seven, along the x axisand I'm going to go one, two, three, four,five, and six, along the y axis.And now this point,so we have the point two comma three,so let me mark that,so two comma three is right over there,so that's two comma three and we also havethe point seven comma six.Seven comma six is going to be right over there.Seven comma six.Let us remind ourselves what they're saying.They're saying the tangent line to the graph of function fat this pointpasses through the point seven comma six.So if it's the tangent line to the graph at that point,it must go through two comma three,that's the only place where it intersects our graphand it goes through seven comma six.We only need two points to define a lineand so the tangent line is going to look like,it's going to look like,let me see if I can,no that's not right.Let me draw itlike it's going to look.Oh that's not exactly right.Let me try one more time.Okay, there you go.So the tangent line is going to look like that.It goes, it's tangent two f right at two comma threeand it goes through the point seven comma sixand so we don't know anything other than fbut we can imagine what f looks like.Our function f could,so our function f,it could look something like this.It just has to be tangentso that line has to be tangent to our functionright at that point.So our function f could look something like that.So when they say, find f prime of two,they're really saying,what is the slope of thetangent line when x is equal to two?So when x is equal to two,well the slope of the tangent lineis the slope of this line.They gave us, they gave us the two points that siton the tangent line.So we just have to figure out its slopebecause that is going to be the rate of change ofthat function right over there,its derivative.It's going to be the slope of the tangent linebecause this is the tangent line.So let's do that.So as we know,slope is change in y over change in x.So if we change our,to go from two comma three to seven comma six,our change in x,change in x,we go from x equals two to x equals 7so our change in x is equal to five.And our change in y,our change in y,we go from y equals three to y equals six.So our change in y is equal to three.So our change in y over change in xis going to be three over fivewhich is the slope of this line,which is the derivative of the function at twobecause this is the tangent line at x equals two.Let's do another one of these.For a function g,we are given that g of negative one equals threeand g prime of negative one is equal to negative two.What is the equation of the tangent line to the graph of gat x equals negative one?Alright, so once againI think it will be helpful to graph this.Sowe have our y axis,we have our x axisand let's see.We say for function g we are given that g of negative oneis equal to three.So the point negative one comma three is on our function.So this is negative one and then we have,one,two,and three.So that's that right over there.That is the point.That is the point negative one comma three,it's going to be on our function.And we also know that g prime of negative oneis equal to negative two.So the slope of the tangent lineright at that point on our functionis going to be negative two.That's what that tells us.The slope of the tangent line,when x is equal to negative one is equal to negative two.So I could use that informationto actually draw the tangent line.So let me see if I can,let me see if I can do this.So it will look,so I think it will,let me just draw it like this.So it's going to go,so it's a slope of negative twois going to look something like that.So as we can see if we move positive one in the x direction,we godown two in the y direction.So that is a slope of negative two.And so you might say well, where is g?Well we could draw what g could look like.G might look something like this.Might look something like that right over therewhere that is the tangent lineor you can make g do all sorts of crazy things after thatbut all we really care about is equationfor this green line.And there's a couple of ways that you could do this.You could say, well look a line is generally,there's a bunch of different ways where you can definethe equation for a line.You could saya line has a form y is equal to mx plus bwhere m is the slope and b is the y intercept.Well we already know what the slope of this line is.It is negative two.So we could say y is equal to negative two.Negative two times x.Times x plus b.And then to solve for b,we know that the point negative one comma threeis on this lineand this goes back to some of your Algebra Ithat you might have learned a few years ago.So let's substitute negative one and three for x and y.So when yis equal to three,so three,three is equal to,is equal to negative two,negative two times x.Times negative one,times negative one plus b.Plus b.And so let's see,this is negative two times negative one is positive two.And so if you subtract two from both sides,you get one is equal to b.And there you have it.That is equation of our line.Y is equal to negative two x plus one.And there's other ways that you could have done this,you could have written the line in point-slope formor you could have done it this way.You could have written it in standard formbut at least this is the way my brain likes to process it.

When we start dealing with non-line or non-linear curves.So let's imagine a curve that looks something like this.So what is the rate of change of ywith respect to x of this curve?Well, let's look at it at different points.And we could at least try to approximate whatit might be in any moment.So let's say that this is one point on a curve.Let's call that x1, and then this is y1.And let's say that this is another point on a curveright over here, x2.And let's call this y2.So this is a point x1, y1, this is a point x2, y2.So we don't have the tools yet.And this is what's exciting about calculus,we will soon have the tools to figure out,what is the rate of change of y with respectto x at exactly this point?But we don't have that tool yet.But using just the tools from algebra,we could at least start to think about,what is the average rate of changeover the interval from x1 to x2?Well, what's the average rate of change?Well, that's just how much did my y change--so that's my change in y-- for this change in x.And so we would calculate it the same way.y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1.So our change in y over this intervalis equal to y2 minus y1, and our changein x is going to be equal to x2 minus x1.So just like that we were able to figure outthe rate of change between these two points.Or another way of thinking about itis, this is the average rate of change for the curve between xequals x1, and x is equal to x2.This is the average rate of changeof y with respect to x over this interval.But what if we have we also figured out here?Well, we figured out the slope of the linethat connects these two points.And what we call a line that intersectsa curve in exactly two places?Well, we figured out, we call that a secant line.So this right over here is a secant line.So the big idea here is we're extending the idea of slope.We said, OK, we already knew how to find the slope of a line.A curve, we don't have the tools yet,but calculus is about to give it to us.But let's just use our algebraic tools.We can at least figure out the average rateof change of a curve, or a function, over an interval.That is the same exact thing as the slope of a secant line.Now just as a little bit of foreshadowing,where is this all going?How will we eventually get the tools, sothat we can figure out the instantaneous rate of change,not just the average?Well just imagine what happens if this point right over heregot closer and closer to this point.Then the secant line is going to better and betterand better approximate the instantaneous rateof change right over here.Or you could even think of it as the slope of the tangent line.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-secant-lines/v/slope-of-a-secant-line	khanacademy	video	:01A curve has the equation y equals the natural log of x,and passes through the points P equals e comma 1.And Q is equal to x natural log of x.Write an expression in x that gives the slope of the secantjoining P and Q. So I think I'm going to need my little scratchpad for this one right over here.So this is the same question over again.Now let's just try to visualize this curve right over here.So let me draw my axes.So let's say this is my y-axis.This is my y-axis, and then this is my x-axis.This is my x-axis right over here.That's my x-axis.And natural log of x-- so let's think about it a little bit.The natural log of 0, e to what power is equal to 0?Well, that's going to be 1.So you're going to have the point 1, 0 on this.So that's 1 right over there.And then the natural log of smaller and smaller numbersas we approach 0 is going to get more and more negative,all the way going down to negative infinity.So this curve is going to look something like this.It's going to look something like that.And we know it also has the point e comma 1 on it.So it has a point, the natural log of e.So if that's 1, that'll be about 2.That'll be about 3.So that is e right over here, roughly e, right over here.And that's the point e comma 1.So that's the point e comma 1 right over there.And I'll just mark that as P thereto give us a label for it.So that is P.And we want to find the secant line between Pand an arbitrary Q for any given x.The y value is going to be natural log of x.So let's say that this is our Q right over here.So let's say this right over here is our-- actually,I want to make it clear that it is a, I'll do it our here.I'm being a little indecisive.So let's say that is our Q right over there.And that's the point x natural log, natural log of x.And we want to find the slope of the secant line joiningthese two points.So this, the slope of this line, Iwant to try to make it so it doesn't look tangent,so it's secant.So you see it cuts through the curve.So that's the secant line right over there.It intersects the curve at P and at Q.So I want to find the slope of that secant line.Well, to find the slope of the secant line,I just need to find the change in yand the change in x between these two points.So what's the change in-- so let's be clear here.This is the point, this is when x is equal to-- well,it's just a kind of arbitrary x.And this right over here is the point lnx.So what is our change in x?Our change in x-- this value right over here,our change in x-- is just going to be x minus eis equal to x minus e.And what is our change in y?Our change in y is going to be lnx is goingto be the natural log of x minus 1, minus 1.That's this distance right over here.So the slope of this line, the linethat contains both of these points, the slope-- I couldwrite m for slope-- is going to be our changein y over our change in x, which is equal to lnx minus 1over x minus e.And now we can just input that and make surethat we got that right.So let me try to remember it-- lnx minus 1 over x minus e.So let me input that.So we have the natural log of x minus 1 over--and it interprets it nicely for us right below,so we make sure that we're doing over x minus e.And now let us check our answer.And we got it right.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-secant-lines/v/graphs-of-functions-and-their-derivatives-example-1	khanacademy	video	:00We're asked, at which points on the graph is f of x timesf prime of x equal to 0?So if I have the product of two things and it's equal to 0,that tells us that at least one of these two thingsneed to be equal to 0.So first of all, let's see are there any points when f of xis equal to 0?So we're plotting f of x on the vertical axis.We could call this graph right over here,we could say this is y is equal to f of x.So at any point, does the y value of this curve equal 0?So it's positive, positive, positive, positive, positive,positive.But it is decreasing right over here.Well, it's decreasing here.Then it's increasing.Then it's decreasing.And it does get to 0 right over here,but that's not one of the labeled points.And they want us to pick one of the labeled pointsor maybe even more than one of these labeled points.So we're going to focus on where f prime of x is equal to 0.And we just have to remind ourselveswhat f prime of x even represents.f prime of x represents the slope of the tangent lineat that value of x.So for example, f prime of 0-- whichis the x value for this point right over here--is going to be some negative value.It's the slope of the tangent line.Similarly, f prime of x, when x isequal to 4-- that's what's going on right over here--that's going to be the slope of the tangent line.That's going to be a positive value.So if you look at all of these, whereis the slope of the tangent line 0?And what does a 0 slope look like?Well, it looks like a horizontal line.So where is the slope of the tangent line here horizontal?Well, the only one that jumps out at meis point B right over here.It looks like the slope of the tangent linewould indeed be horizontal right over here.Or another way you could think of it is the instantaneous rateof change of the function, right at x equals 2,looks like it's pretty close to-- if thisis x equals 2-- looks like it's pretty close to 0.So out of all of the choices here,I would say only B looks like the derivative at x equals 2.Or the slope of the tangent line at B, it looks like it's 0.So I'll say B right over here.And then they had this kind of crazy, wacky expression here. fof x minus 6 over x.What is that greatest in value?And we have to interpret this.We have to think about what does f of x minus 6 over x actuallymean?Whenever I see expressions like this,especially if I'm taking a differential calculus class,I would say well, this looks kind oflike finding the slope of a secant line.In fact, all of what we know about derivativesis finding the limiting value of the slope of a secant line.And this looks kind of like that,especially if at some point, my y value is a 6 here.And this could be the change in y value.And if the corresponding x value is 0,then this would be f of x minus 6 over x minus 0.So do I have 0, 6 on this curve here?Well, sure.When x is equal to 0, we see that f of x is equal to 6.So what this is right over here-- let me rewrite this.This we could rewrite as f of x minus 6 over x minus 0.So what is this?What does this represent?Well, this is equal to the slope--let me do some of that color-- thisis equal to the slope of the secant line between the points,x, f of x, x, and whatever the corresponding f of x is.And we could write it as 0, f of 0 because we see f of 0is equal to 6.This right over here is f of 0.In fact, let me just write that as 6.And the point, 0, 6.So let's go through each of these pointsand think about what the slope of the secant linebetween those points are and point A. This is essentiallythe slope of the secant line between some point x, fof x, and essentially point A. So let's draw this out.So between A and B you have a fairly negative slope.Remember we want to find the largest slope.So here it's fairly negative.Between A and C, it's less negative.Between A and D, it's even less negative.It's still negative, but it's less negative.And then between A and E, it becomes more negative now.And then between A and F, it becomes even more negative.So when is the slope of the secant line between oneof these points and A the greatest?Or I guess we could say the least negative?Because it seems like they're always negative.It would be between point D and A.So when is this greatest in value?Well, when we're looking at point D.At point D, x is equal to 6 and itlooks like f of x is like 5 and 1/2 or something.So this will turn into f of 6, which is 5 and 1/2 or maybeit's even less than that-- 5 and 1/3or something, minus 6 over 6 minus 0.That's how we'll maximize this value.This is the least negative slope of the secant line.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/calculus-derivatives-1-new-hd-version	khanacademy	video	:00We're first exposed to the idea of a slope of a line early onin our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurtsto review it a bit.So let me draw some axes.That is my y-axis.Maybe I should call it my f of x-axis.y is equal to f of x.Let me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis.And let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this.And what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do wefind the slope of that line?And what we do is, we take two points on the line,so let's say we take this point, right here.Let's say that that is the point x is equal to a.And then what would this be?This would be the point f of a, where the function isgoing to be some line.We could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b.We don't know what m and b are, but this is alla little bit of review.So this is a.And then the y-value is what happens to the function whenyou evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there.And then we could take another point on this line.Let's say we take point b, right there.And then this coordinate up here is going to bethe point b, f of b.Right?Because this is just the point when you evaluatethe function at b.You put b in here, you're going to get that point right there.So let me just draw a little line right there.So that is f of b, right there.Actually, let me make it clear that this coordinate rightis the point a, f of a.So how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or moregenerally, of this entire line?Because whole the slope is consistent thewhole way through it.And we know that once we find the slope, that'sactually going to be the value of this m.That's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it?Well, a couple of ways to think about it.Slope is equal to rise over run.You might have seen that when you first learned algebra.Or another way of writing it, it's change iny over change in x.So let's figure out what the change in why over the changein x is for this particular case.So the change in y is equal to what?Well, let's just take, you can take this guy as being thefirst point, or that guy as being the first point.But since this guy has a larger x and a larger y,let's start with him.The change in y between that guy and that guy is thisdistance, right here.So let me draw a little triangle.That distance right there is a change in y.Or I could just transfer it to the y-axis.This is the change in y.That is your change in y, that distance.So what is that distance?It's f of b minus f of a.So it equals f of b minus f of a.That is your change in y.Now what is your change in x The slope is changein y over change in x.So what our change in x?What's this distance?Remember, we're taking this to be the first point,so we took its y minus the other point's y.So to be consistent, we're going to have to take thispoint x minus this point x.So this point's x-coordinate is b.So it's going to be b minus a.And just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, orif you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would justplug them in right here and you would get your slope.That straightforward.And that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class.And let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, ifthis was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here,was the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope ofthis line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change iny, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then wedo that over 5 minus 2.Because this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so thiswould be your change in x.5 minus 2.So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so yourslope would be 4/3.Now let's see if we can generalize this.And this is what the new concept that we're goingto be learning as we delve into calculus.Let's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve.So let's say I have a curve.We have to have a curve before we can generalizeit to a curve.Let me scroll down a little.Well, actually, I want to leave this up here, showyou the similarity.Let's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now.Let's say I have a curve.I'll make it a familiar-looking curve.Let's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, whichlooks something like that.And I want to find the slope.Let's say I want to find the slope at some point.And actually, before even talking about it, let's eventhink about what it means to find the slope of a curve.Here, the slope was the same the whole time, right?But on a curve your slope is changing.And just to get an intuition for that means, is, what'sthe slope over here?Your slope over here is the slope of the tangent line.The line just barely touches it.That's the slope over there.It's a negative slope.Then over here, your slope is still negative, but it's alittle bit less negative.It goes like that.I don't know if I did that, drew that.Let me do it in a different color.Let me do it in purple.So over here, your slope is slightly less negative.It's a slightly less downward-sloping line.And then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here,your slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, yequals 0, is tangent to this curve.And then as you go to more positive x's, then yourslope starts increasing.I'm trying to draw a tangent line.And here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more.So your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kindof the big change that happens when you go from aline to a curve.A line, your slope is the same the entire time.You could take any two points of a line, take the change in yover the change in x, and you get the slope forthe entire line.But as you can see already, it's going to be a littlebit more nuanced when we do it for a curve.Because it depends what point we're talking about.We can't just say, what is the slope for this curve?The slope is different at every point along the curve.It changes.If we go up here, it's going to be even steeper.It's going to look something like that.So let's try a bit of an experiment.And I know how this experiment turns out, so it won'tbe too much of a risk.Let me draw better than that.So that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.Let's call this, we can call this y, or we can callthis the f of x axis.Either way.And let me draw my curve again.And I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that.That's my curve.And what if I want to find the slope right there?What can I do?Well, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 pointsto find a slope, right?Here, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point.So let's just call this point right here,that's going to be x.We're going to be general.This is going to be our point x.But to find our slope, according to our traditionalalgebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points.So let's get another point in here.Let's just take a slightly larger version of this x.So let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it evenfurther out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise.So let's say we have this point right here.And the difference, it's just h bigger than x.Or actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, welllet me just say h bigger.So this is x plus h.That's what that point is right there.So what going to be their corresponding y-coordinateson the curve?Well, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x.So this point right here is going to be f of ourparticular x right here.And maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybeI'll do a little 0 here.This is x naught, this is x naught plus h.This is f of x naught.And then what is this going to be up here, this point uphere, that point up here?Its y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate,which I shifted over a little bit.It's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which isf of x naught plus h.That's its y-coordinate.So what is a slope going to be between these two points thatare relatively close to each other?Remember, this isn't going to be the slopejust at this point.This is the slope of the line between these two points.And if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be asecant line between, to the curve.So it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point,once at this point.You can't see it.If I blew it up a little bit, it would looksomething like this.This is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up hereis our coordinate for this point, which would be, thex-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinatewould be f of x naught plus h.Just whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at thisx-coordinate That's all it is.So these are the 2 points.So maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is theslope of this secant line?And just like we did in the previous example, you find thechange in y, and you divide that by your change in x.Let me draw it here.Your change in y would be that right here, change in y, andthen your change in x would be that right there.So what is the slope going to be of the secant line?The slope is going to be equal to, let's start with thispoint up here, just because it seems to be larger.So we want a change in y. so this value right here, thisy-value, is f of x naught plus h.I just evaluated this guy up here.Looks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look.The slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate.Where the curve is at that value of x.So that is going to be, so the change in y is going to bea f of x naught plus h.That's just the y-coordinate up here.Minus this y-coordinate over here.So minus f of x naught.So that equals our change in y.And you want to divide that by your change in x.So what is this?This is the larger x-value.We started with this coordinate, so we startwith its x-coordinate.So it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h.Minus this x-coordinate.Well, we just picked a general number.It's x naught.So that is over your change in x.Just like that.So this is the slope of the secant line.We still haven't answered what the slope is right at thatpoint, but maybe this will help us get there.If we simplify this, so let me write it down like this.The slope of the secant, let me write that properly.The slope of the secant line is equal to the value of thefunction at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the valueof the function here, mine f of x naught.So that just tells us the change in y.It's the exact same definition of slope we've always used.Over the change in x.And we can simplify this.We have x naught plus h minus x naught.So x naught minus x naught cancel out, so youhave that over h.So this is equal to our change in y over change in x.Fair enough.But I started off saying, I want to find the slope ofthe line at that point, at this point, right here.This is the zoomed-out version of it.So what can I do?Well, I defined second point here as just the firstpoint plus some h.And we have something in our toolkit called a limit.This h is just a general number.It could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1times 10 to the negative 100.It could be an arbitrarily small number.So what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically,if I were take the limit as h approaches 0?So, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number overhere, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd befinding the slope of this secant line.If I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding theslope of that secant line.If h is a little bit smaller, I'd be findingthe slope of that line.So as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer tofinding the slope of the line right at my point in question.Obviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is goingto be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there.But if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally smallnumber, then I'm going to get pretty close.So what happens if I take the limit as happroaches zero of this?So the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope.Of, let me switch to green.f of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change iny, over h, which is my change in x.And now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'llsee it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of anh, they'll write a delta x here.Where this second point would have been defined as x naughtplus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to justdelta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit asdelta x approaches 0.The exact same thing.h, delta x, doesn't matter.We're taking h as the difference between one x pointand then the higher x point, and then we're just going totake the limit as that approaches zero.We could have called that delta x just as easily.But I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slopeof the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of thetangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f.Let me write that down.And I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x.And this is going to be another function.Because remember, the slope changes at every x-value.No matter what x-value you pick, the slope isgoing to be different.Doesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve,it is different.It can be different.So now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply thisformula over here, and then I can tell you theslope at that point.And it all seems very confusing and maybeabstract at this point.In the next video, I'll actually do an example ofcalculating a slope, and it'll make it everything alittle bit more concrete.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/formal-and-alternate-form-of-the-derivative-for-ln-x	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that f of x is equal to the natural log of x,and we want to figure out what the slope of the tangent lineto the curve f is when x is equal to the number e.So here, x is equal to the number e.The point e comma 1 is on the curve.f of e is 1.The natural log of e is 1.And I've drawn the slope of the tangent line,or I've drawn the tangent line.And we need to figure out what the slope of itis, or at least come up with an expression for it.And I'm going to come up with an expression usingboth the formal definition and the alternate definition.That will allow us to compare them a little bit.So let's think about first the formal definition.So the formal definition wants usto find an expression for the derivative of our functionat any x.So let's say that this is some arbitrary x right over here.This would be the point x comma f of x.And let's say that this is-- let's call this x plus h.So this distance right over here is going to be h.This right over here is going to bethe point, x plus h f of x plus h.Now, the whole underlying idea of the formal definitionof limits is to find the slope of the secant linebetween these two points, and thentake the limit as h approaches 0.As h gets closer and closer, this blue pointis going to get closer and closer and closer to x.And this point is going to approach it on the curve.And the secant line is going to becomea better and better and better approximationof the tangent line at x.So let's actually do that.So what's the slope of the secant line?Well, it's the change in your vertical axis, whichis going to be f of x plus h minus f of x--over the change in your horizontal axis.And that's x plus h minus x.And we see here the difference is just h.Over h.And we're going to take the limit of thatas h approaches 0.So in the case when f of x is the natural log of x,this will reduce to the limit as h approaches 0.f of x plus h is the natural log of xplus h minus the natural log of x, all of that over h.So this right over here, for our particular f of x,this is equal to f prime of x.So if we wanted to evaluate this when x is equal to e,then everywhere we see an x we justhave to replace it with an e.This is essentially expressing our derivativeas a function of x.It's kind of a crazy-looking function of x.You have a limit here and all of that.But every place you see an x, like any function definition,you can replace it now with an e.So we can-- let me just do that.Whoops.I lost my screen.Here we go.So we could write f prime of e isequal to the limit as h approaches 0 of natural log--let me do it in the same color so wecan keep track of things-- natural log of e plus h--I'll just leave that blank for now--minus the natural log of e, all of that over h.So just like that.This right over here, if we evaluate this limit--if we're able to and we actually can--if we are able to evaluate this limit,this would give us the slope of the tangent line whenx equals e.This is doing the formal definition.Now let's do the alternate definition.The alternate definition-- if youdon't want to find a general derivative expressedas a function of x like this and you justwant to find the slope at a particular point,the alternate definition kind of just gets straight to the pointthere.So what they say is hey, look, let's imaginesome other x value here.So let's imagine some other x value.This right over here is the point x comma-- well,we could say f of x or we could even say the natural log of x.What is the slope of the secant line between those two points?Well, it's going to be your change in y values.So it's going to be natural log of x minus 1--let me do that red color-- over your change in x values.That's x minus e.So that's the slope of the secant line between those twopoints.Well, what if you want to get the tangent line?Well, let's just take the limit as x approaches e.As x gets closer and closer and closer,these points are going to get closer and closer and closer,and the secant line is going to better approximatethe tangent line.So we're just going to take the limit as x approaches e.So either one of this.This is using the formal definition of a limit.Let me make it clear that that h does not belong part of it.So we could either do it using the formal definitionor the alternate definition of the derivative.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/formal-and-alternate-form-of-the-derivative-example-1	khanacademy	video	:00The alternate form of the derivative of the functionf, at a number a, denoted by f prime of a,is given by this stuff.Now this might look a little strange to you,but if you really think about what it's saying,it's really just taking the slopeof the tangent line between a comma f of a.So let's imagine some arbitrary function like this.Let's say that that is-- well I'll justwrite that's our function f.And so you could have the point whenx is equal to a-- this is our x-axis-- when x is equal to a,this is the point a, f of a.You notice a, f of a.And then we could take the slope between that and some arbitrarypoint, let's call that x.So this is the point x, f of x.And notice, the numerator right here, thisis just our change in the value of our function.Or you could view that as the change in the vertical axis.So that would give you this distance right over here.That's what we're doing up here in the numerator.And then in the denominator, we'refinding the change in our horizontal values,horizontal coordinates.Let me do that in a different color.So the change in the horizontal, that's this right over here.And then they're trying to find the limit as x approaches a.So as x gets closer and closer and closer and closerto a, what's going to happen is, is that when x is out here,we have this secant line.We're finding the slope of this secant line.But as x gets closer and closer, the secant linesbetter and better and better approximatethe slope of the tangent line.Where the limit, as x approaches a, but doesn't quite equal a,is going to be-- this is actuallyour definition of our derivative.Or I guess the alternate form of the derivative definition.And this would be the slope of the tangent line, if it exists.So with that all that out the way,let's try to answer their question.With the Alternative Form of the Derivative as an aid,make sense of the following limit expressionby identifying the function f and the number a.So right here, they want to find the slope of the tangent lineat 5.Here they wanted to find the slope of the tangent line at a.So it's pretty clear that a is equal to 5.And that f of a is equal to 125.Now what about f of x?Well here, it's a limit of f of x minus f of a.Well here it's the limit as x to the third minus 125.And this makes sense.If f of x is equal to x to the third,then it makes sense that f of 5 is going to be 5 to the third,is going to be 125.And we're also taking up here the limit as x approaches a.Here we're taking the limit as x approaches 5.So this is the derivative of the functionf of x is equal to x to the third.Let me write that down in the green color.x to the third at the number a is equal to 5.And so we can imagine this.Let's try to actually graph it, just so that we can imagine it.Actually, I'll do it out here, whereI have a little bit better contrast with the colors.So let's say that is my y-axis.Let's say that this is my x-axis.I'm not going to quite draw it to scale.Let's say this right over here is the 125.Or y, this is when y equals 125.This is when x is equal to 5, so they're clearlynot at the same scale.But the function is going to look something like this.We know what x to the third looks like,it looks something like this.So here, our a is equal to 5.This point right over here is 5, 125.And then we're taking the slope between that pointand an arbitrary x-value.Or I should say an arbitrary other point on the curve.So this right over here would be the point,we could call that x, x to the third.We know that f of x is equal to x to the third.And let me make it clear.This is a graph of y is equal to x to the third.And so this expression, right over here, all of this, thisis the slope between these two points.And as we take the limit as x approaches 5,so right now this is our x, as x getscloser and closer and closer to 5,the secant lines are going to better and betterapproximate the slope of the tangent line at x equals 5.So the slope of a tangent line would look something like that.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/calculus-derivatives-2-new-hd-version	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video we tried to figure out the slope of apoint or the slope of a curve at a certain point.And the way we did, we said OK, well let's find the slopebetween that point and then another point that's not toofar away from that point.And we got the slope of the secantline.And it looks all fancy, but this is just the y value of thepoint that's not too far away, and this is just the y valuepoint of the point in question, so this isjust your change in y.And then you divide that by your change in x.So in the example we did, h was the differencebetween our 2 x values.This distance was h.And that gave us the slope of that line.We said hey, what if we take the limit as this pointright here gets closer and closer to this point.If this point essentially almost becomes this point, thenour slope is going to be the slope of our tangent line.And we define that as the derivative of our function.We said that's equal to f prime of x.So let's if we can apply this in this video to maybe makethings a little bit more concrete in your head.So let me do one.First I'll do a particular case where I want to find theslope at exactly some point.So let me draw my axes again.Let's draw some axes right there.Let's say I have the curve-- this is the curve-- yis equal to x squared.So this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and I want to knowthe slope at the point x is equal to 3.When I say the slope you can imagine a tangent line here.You can imagine a tangent line that goes just like that, andit would just barely graze the curve at that point.But what is the slope of that tangent line?What is the slope of that tangent line which is the sameas the slope of the curve right at that point.So to do it, I'm actually going to do this exact technique thatwe did before, then we'll generalize it so you don't haveto do it every time for a particular number.So let's take some other point here.Let's call this 3 plus delta x.I'm changing the notation because in some books you'llsee an h, some books you'll see a delta x, doesn't hurt tobe exposed to both of them.So this is 3 plus delta x.So first of all what is this point right here?This is a curve y is equal to x squared, so f of x is 3squared-- this is the point 9.This is the point 3,9 right here.And what is this point right here?So if we were go all the way up here, what is that point?Well here our x is 3 plus delta x.It's the same thing as this one right here,as x naughtplus h.I could have called this 3 plus h just as easily.So it's 3 plus delta x up there.So what's the y value going to be?Well whatever x value is, it's on the curve, it's goingto be that squared.So it's going to be the point 3 plus delta x squared.So let's figure out the slope of this secantline.And let me zoom in a little bit, because that might help.So if I zoom in on just this part of the curve,it might look like that.And then I have one point here, and then I have theother point is up here.That's the secantline.Just like that.This was the point over here, the point 3,9.And then this point up here is the point 3 plus delta x, sojust some larger number than 3, and then it's going tobe that number squared.So it's going to be 3 plus delta x squared.What is that?That's going to be 9.I'm just foiling this out, or you do the distributeproperty twice.a plus b squared is a squared plus 2 a b plus b squared, soit's going to be 9 plus two times the productof these things.So plus 6 delta x, and then plus delta x squared.That's the coordinate of the second line.This looks complicated, but I just took this x value and Isquared it, because it's on the line y is equal to x squared.So the slope of the secantline is going to be the change in y dividedby the change in x.So the change in y is just going to be this guy's y value,which is 9 plus 6 delta x plus delta x squared.That's this guy's y value, minus this guy's y value.So minus 9.That's your change in y.And you want to divide that by your change in x.Well what is your change in x?This is actually going to be pretty convenient.This larger x value-- we started with this point on thetop, so we have to start with this point on the bottom.So it's going to be 3 plus delta x.And then what's this x value?What is minus 3?That's his x value.So what does this simplify to?The numerator-- this 9 and that 9 cancel out,we get a 9 minus 9.And in the denominator what happens?This 3 and minus 3 cancel out.So the change in x actually end up becoming this delta x, whichmakes sense, because this delta x is essentially how much morethis guy is then that guy.So that should be the change in x, delta x.So the slope of my secantline has simplified to 6 times my change in x, plus my changein x squared, all of that over my change in x.And now we can simplify this even more.Let's divide the numerator and the denominatorby our change in x.And I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony.So my slope of my tangent of my secantline-- the one that goes through both of these-- isgoing to be equal if you divide the numerator anddenominator this becomes 6.I'm just dividing numerator and denominator by deltax plus six plus delta x.So that is the slope of this secantline So slope is equal to 6 plus delta x.That's this one right here.That's this reddish line that I've drawn right there.So this number right here, if the delta x was one, ifthese were the points 3 and 4, then my slope would be 6 plus1, because I'm picking a point 4 where the delta x herewould have to be 1.So the slope would be 7.So we have a general formula for no matter what my deltax is, I can find the slope between 3 and 3 plus delta x.Between those two points.Now we wanted to find the slope at exactly thatpoint right there.So let's see what happens when delta x getsmaller and smaller.This is what delta x is right now.It's this distance.But if delta x got a little bit smaller, then the secantline would look like that.Got even smaller, the secantline would look like that, it gets even smaller.Then we're getting pretty close to the slopeof the tangent line.The tangent line is this thing right here that Iwant to find the slope of.Let's find a limit as our delta x approaches 0.So the limit as delta x approaches 0 of ourslope of the secantline of 6 plus delta x is equal to what?This is pretty straightforward.You can just set this equal to 0 and it's equal to 6.So the slope of our tangent line at the point x is equal to3 right there is equal to 6.And another way we could write this if we wrote that f ofx is equal to x squared.We now know that the derivative or the slope of the tangentline of this function at the point 3-- I just only evaluatedit at the point 3 right there-- that that is equal to 6.I haven't yet come up with a general formula for the slopeof this line at any point, and I'm going to do thatin the next video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/calculus-derivatives-2-5-new-hd-version	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we found the slope at a particular point ofthe curve y is equal to x squared.But let's see if we can generalize this and come upwith a formula that finds us the slope at any point of thecurve y is equal to x squared.So let me redraw my function here.It never hurts to have a nice drawing.So that is my y-axis.That is my x-axis right there.My x-axis.Let me draw my curve.It looks something like that.You've seen that multiple times.This is y is equal to x squared.So let's be very general right now.Remember, if we want to find-- let me just write thedefinition of our derivative.So if we have some point right here-- let's call that x.So we want to be very general.We want to find the slope at the point x.We want to find a function where you give me an xand I'll tell you the slope at that point.We're going to call that f prime of x.That's going to be the derivative of f of x.But all it does is, look, f of x, you give-- it's a functionthat you give it an x, and it tells you the value of that.And we draw the curve here.With f of x, you give that same x but it's not going to tellyou the value of the curve.It's not going to say, oh, this is your f of x.It's going to give you the value of the slope ofthe curve at that point.So f of x, if you put it into that function, it should tellyou, oh, the slope at that point, is equal to-- you know,if you put 3 there, you'll say, oh, the slope thereis equal to 6.We saw that in the last example.So that's what we want to do.And we saw on the last-- I think it was 2-- videos ago,that we defined f prime of x to be equal to-- just the--well, I'll write it this way.It's the slope of the secant line between x and somepoint that's a little bit further away from x.So the slope of the secant line is change in y.So it's the y value of the point that's a littlebit further away from x.So f of x plus h minus the y value at x, right?Because this is right here.This is f of x.So minus f of x.All of that over the change in x.So if this is x plus h here, the change in xis x plus h minus x.Or this distance right here is just h.The change in x is going to be equal to h.So that's just slope of the secant line, betweenany 2 points like that.And we said, hey, we could find the slope of the tangent lineif we just take the limit of this as it approaches--as h approaches 0.And then we'll be finding the slope of the tangent line.Now let's apply this idea to a particular function, f ofx is equal to x squared.Or y is equal to x squared.So here, we could have the point-- we could consider thisto be the point x-- x squared.So f of x is just equal to x squared.And then this would be the point-- let me do it ina more vibrant color.This is the point x plus h-- that's this point right here.It's a little bit further down.And then x plus h squared.And you know, in the last video, we did thisfor a particular x.We did it for 3.But now I want a general formula.You give me any x and I won't have to do what I did in thelast video for any particular number.I'll have a general function.You give me 7, I'll tell you what the slope is at 7.You give me negative 3, I'll tell you what the slopeis at negative 3.You give me 100,000, I'll tell you what theslope is at 100,000.So let's apply it here.So we want to find the change in y over the change in x.So first of all, the change in y is this guy's y value,which is x plus h squared.That's this guy's y value right here.That's this right here.That's x plus h squared.I just took x plus h, evaluated, I squared it, andthat's its point on the curve.So it's x plus h squared.So that's there right there.And then what's this value?f of x right here is equal to-- I know it's getting messy--is equal to x squared.If you take your x, you evaluate the functionat that point, you're going to get x squared.So it's equal to minus x squared.This is your change in y.That's this distance right there.And just to relate it to our definition of a derivative,this blue thing right here is equivalent to thisthing right here.We just evaluated our function.Our function is f of x is equal to x squared.We just evaluated when x is equal to x plus h.So if you have to square it, if I put an a there,it'd be a squared.If I put an apple there, it'd be apple squared.If I put an x plus h in there, it's going tobe x plus h squared.So this is that thing.And then, this thing right here is just the function evaluatedat the point in question.Right there.So this is our change in y.And let's divide that by our change in x.Our change in x-- if this is x plus h and this is just x, ourchange in x is just going to be h.So that's where we get that term from.So this is just a slope between these 2 points.This is just a slope between those two points.But, of course, we want to find-- the limit at this pointgets closer and closer to this point, and this point getscloser and closer to that point.So this becomes a tangent line.So we're going to take the limit as h approaches 0, andthis is our f prime of x.And this is the exact same definition of this, insteadof being general and saying, for any function, we knowwhat the function was.It was f of x is equal to x squared.So we actually applied it.Instead of f of x, we wrote x squared.Instead of f of x plus h, we wrote x plus h squared.So let's see if we can evaluate this limit.So this is going to be equal to the limit as h approaches0 to square this out.I'll do it in the same color.That's x squared plus 2xh plus h squared, and then we havethis minus x squared over here.I just multiplied this guy out over here.And then all of that is divided by h.Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.Well, you immediately see you have an x squared and youhave a minus x squared, so those cancel out.And then we can divide the numerator and thedenominator by h.So this simplifies to-- so we get f prime of x is equal to--if we divide the numerator and the denominator by h--we get 2x plus h.I'm sorry, I forgot my limit.It equals the limit.Very important.Limit as h approaches 0 of divide everything by h, andyou get 2x plus h squared divided by h is h.And if you remember the last video, when we did it with aparticular x, we said x is equal to 3, we got 6plus delta x here.Or 6 plus h here, so it's very similar.So if you take the limited h approaches 0 here, that'sjust going to disappear.So this is just going to be equal to 2x.So we just figured out that if f of x-- this is a big result.This is exciting!That if f of x is equal to x squared, f primeof x is equal to 2x.That's what we just figured out.And I wanted to make sure you understandhow to interpret this.f of x, if you give me a value, is going to tell you the valueof the function at that point.At prime of x it's going to tell you theslope at that point.Let me draw that.Because this is a key realization.And you might, you know, it's kind of maybe initiallyunintuitive to think of a function that gives us theslope, at any point, of another function.So it looks like this.Let me draw a little neater than that.Ah, it's still not that neat.That's satisfactory.Let me just draw it in the positive coordinate.Well, I'll just draw the whole-- the curve lookssomething like that.Now this is the curve of f of x.This is the curve of f of x is equal to x squared.Just like that.So if you give me a point.You give me the point 7.You apply, you put it in here, you square it.And it is mapped to the number 49.So you get the number 49 right there.This is the number 7, 49.You're used to dealing with functions right there.But what is f prime of 7?f prime of 7.You say, 2 times 7 is equal to 14.What is this 14 number here?What is this thing?Well, this is the slope of the tangent lineat x is equal to 7.So if I were to take that point and draw a tangent line-- apoint that just grazes our curve-- if I were to justdraw a tangent line.That wasn't tangent enough for me.So that's my tangent line right there.You get the idea.The slope of this guy-- you do your change in y over yourchange in x-- is going to be equal to 14.The slope of the curve at y is equal to 7-- isa pretty steep curve.If you wanted to find the slope, let's say that thisis y-- let's say it's x is equal to 2.I said at x is equal to 7, the slope is 14.At x is equal to 2, what is the slope?Well, you figure out f prime of 2, which is equal to 2 times2, which is equal to 4.So the slope here is 4.You could say m is equal to 4. m for slope.What is f prime of 0?f prime.We know that f of 0 is 0, right?0 squared is 0.But what is f prime of 0?Well, 2 times 0 is 0.That's also equal to 0.But what does that mean?What's the interpretation?It means the slope of the tangent line is 0.So a 0 sloped line looks like this.Looks just like a horizontal line.And that looks about right.A horizontal line would be tangent to thecurve at y equals 0.Let's try another one.Let's try the point minus 1.So let's say we're right there. x is equal to minus 1.So f of minus 1, you just square it.Because we're dealing with x squared.So it's equal to 1.That's that point right there.What is f prime of minus 1?f prime of minus 1 is 2 times minus 1.2 times minus is minus 2.What does that mean?It means that the slope of the tangent line at x is equal to1, to this curve, to the function, is minus 2.So if I were to draw the tangent line here-- the tangentline looks like that-- and look, it is a downwardsloping line.And it makes sense.The slope here is equal to minus 2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-definition/v/tangent-slope-as-limiting-value-of-secant-slope-example-3	khanacademy	video	:00With the graph of the function f as an aid,evaluate the following limits.So the first one is the limit as x approaches3 of f of x minus f of 3 over x minus 3.So let's think about x minus-- x equals 3 is right over here.This right over here is f of 3, or we could say f of 3is 1 right over here.That's the point 3 comma f of 3.And they're essentially trying to findthe slope between an arbitrary x and thatpoint as that x gets closer and closer to 3.So we can imagine an x that is above 3,that is, say, right over here.Well, if we're trying to find the slope between this x commaf of x and 3 comma f of 3, we seethat it gets this exact same form.Your end point is f of x.So it's f of x minus f of 3 is your changein the vertical axis.That's this distance right over here.And we would divide by your changein the horizontal axis, which is your change in x.And that's going to be x minus 3.So that's the exact expression that we have up here whenI picked this as an arbitrary x.And we see that that slope, just by lookingat the line between those two intervals,seems to be negative 2.And the slope was the same thing if we go the other side.If x was less than 3, then we alsowould have a slope of negative 2.Either way, we have a slope of negative 2.And that's important because this limitis just the limit as x approaches 3.So it can be as x approaches 3 from the positive directionor from the negative direction.But in either case, the slope, as we get closer and closerto this point right over here, is negative 2.Now let's think about what they're asking us here.So we have 8, f of 8.So let's think.We have 8.This is 8 comma f of 8.So that's 8 comma f of 8 right over there.And they have f of 8 plus h.So our temptation might be to say, hey,8 plus h is going to be someplace out here.It's going to be something larger than 8.But notice, they have the limit as happroaches 0 from the negative direction.So approaching 0 from the negative directionmeans you're coming to 0 from below.You're at negative 1, negative 0.5, negative 0.1,negative 0.0001.So h is actually going to be a negative number.So 8 plus h would actually be-- we could justpick an arbitrary point.It could be something like this right over here.So this might be the value of 8 plus h.And this would be the value of f of 8 plus h.So once again, they're finding-- or this expressionis the slope between these two points.And then we are taking the limit as h approaches 0from the negative direction.So as h gets closer and closer to 0,this down here moves further and further to the right.And these points move closer and closer and closer together.So this is really just an expressionof the slope of the line, roughly--and we see that it's constant.So what's the slope of the line over this interval?Well, you can just eyeball it and see, well, look.Every time x changes by 1, our f of x changes by 1.So the slope of the line there is 1.It would have been a completely different thingif this said limit as h approaches 0from the positive direction.Then we would be looking at points over here.And we would see that we would slowly approach, essentially,a vertical slope, kind of an infinite slope.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-estimating-derivatives/v/estimating-derivative-at-a-point	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So we're told that this tablegives select values of the differentiable function F.So it gives us the value of the functionat a few values for X, in particular,five different values for X andit tells us what the corresponding f(x) is.And they say, what is the best estimatefor f'(4)?So this is the derivative of our function Fwhen X is equal to four.Or another way to think about it,what is the slope of the tangent linewhen X is equal to four for f(x)?So what is the best estimate for f'(4)we can make based on this table?So, let's just visualize what's going onbefore we even look at the choices.So let me draw some axes here.And let me plot these points.We know that these would sit on the curve of Yis equal to f(x).When X is zero, f(x) is 72.So this is the point (0,72).This is the point (3,95)clearly, two different scales on the X and Y axes.This is the point(5,112).This is (6,77).This is (9,54), actually, let mewrite outthethis is one, two, three,four, five, six,seven, eight, nine,and ten.Now they want us to know, they want towhat is the derivative of our functionwhen F is equal to four?Well, they haven't told useven what the value of F is at four.We don't know what that point is.But what they're trying to do is,well, we're trying to make a best estimate.And using these points, we don't even knowexactly what the curve looks like.It could look like all sorts of things.We could try to fit a reasonably smooth curve.The curve might look something like that.But it might be wackier.It might do something like this.Let me try to do it.It might look somethinglike this.So we don't know, for sure.All we know is thatit needs to go through those points.'Cause they've just sampled to the functionat those points.But let's just, for the sake ofthis exercise, let's assume the simplest,let's say it's a nice smoothcurve without too many twists and turnsthat goes through these points, just like that.So what they're asking, okay,when X is equal to fourif this yellow curve were the actual curvethen what is the slope of the tangent line, at that point?So we would be visualizing that.Now to be clear,this tangent line that I just drewthis would be forthis version of our function that I didconnecting these points.That does not have to bethe actual function.We know that the actual function has to gothrough those points.But I'm just doing this for visualization purposes.One of the whole ideas here isthat all we do have is the sampleand we're trying to get a best estimate.We don't knowif it's even gonna be a good estimate.It's just going to be a best estimate.So what we generally dowhen we just have some dataaround a point, is, let's use a data pointsthat are closestto that pointand find slopes of secant linespretty close around that point.And that's going to give us our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent line.So what points do we have nearF of four, or near the point(4,f(4))?Well, they give us what F is equal towhen X is equal to three.They give us this point, right over here.Let me do this in another color.So, (3,95)that is that right over there.And they also give us(5,112).That is that point right over there.And so what we could dowe could say, well, what is the averagerate of change between these two points?Another way to think about it is,what is the slope of the secant linebetween those two points.And, that would be our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent lineat X equals four.Do we know that it's a good estimate?Do we know that it's even close?No, we don't know for sure, but that wouldbe the best estimate.It would be better than trying to take thethe average rate of change betweenWhen X equals threeand X equals six.Or between when X equals zeroand X equals nine.These are pretty close around four.And so, let's do that.Let's find the average rate of changebetween when X goes from three to five.So, we can see hereour change in X.Let me do this in a new color.So our change in X hereis equal toplus two.And I can draw that out.My change in X hereisplus two.And, my change in Yis going to bewhen my X increased by two, my change in Y isplus, let's see, this isif I add ten I get toI get to 105.If I add another sevenso this is plus 17.So this is plus 17 right over here.Plus 17.And so my change in Y over change in X.Change in Yover my change in X.For this secant line betweenwhen X is equaling threeand X is equaling fiveis going to be equal to 17 over two.Seventeen overtwo.Which is equal to 8.5.So the slope of this green line here is 8.5.And that would be our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent line when X equals fourof the curve Y is equal to f(x).And so, lucky for usthe people who wrote this question hadthe exact same logic, and they did it right over there.So you wouldn't have to graph it the way I did.I did it just to help us visualize what's going on.In general, when you see a question like thisthey're really saying, look,you don't have all the data you needto figure out exactly what f'(4) is.But if you can find points close to, or aroundf'(4)and find the secant line, the average rateof the slope of the secant line.Or the average rate of change between those pointsthat's going to be our best estimatefor the instantaneous rate of changewhen X equals four.Or the derivative when X equals four.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-differentiability/v/differentiability	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois explore the notion of differentiability at a point.And that is just a fancy way of sayingdoes the function have a defined derivative at a point?So let's just remind ourselves a definition of a derivative.And there's multiple ways of writing this.For the sake of this video, I'll write it asthe derivative of our function at point C,this is Lagrange notation with this F prime.The derivative of our function F at C is going to be equalto the limit as X approaches Zof F of X, minus F of C,over X minus C.And at first when you see this formula,and we've seen it before, it looks a little bit strange,but all it is is it's calculating the slope,this is our change in the value of our function,or you could think of it as our change in Y,if Y is equal to F of X, and this is our change in X.And we're just trying to see, well, what is that slopeas X gets closer and closer to C, as our change in Xgets closer and closer to zero?And we talk about that in other videos.So I'm now going to make a few claims in this video,and I'm not going to prove them rigorously.There's another video that will go a little bit moreinto the proof direction.But this is more to get an intuition.And so the first claim that I'm going to makeis if F is differentiable,at X equals C,at X equals C,then F is continuousat X equals C.So I'm saying if we know it's differentiable,if we can find this limit,if we can find this derivative at X equals C,then our function is also continuous at X equals C.It doesn't necessarily mean the other way around,and actually we'll look at a case where it's notnecessarily the case the other way around thatif you're continuous, then you're definitely differentiable.But another way to interpret what I just wrote down is,if you are not continuous, then you definitelywill not be differentiable.If F not continuousat X equals C, then Fis not differentiable,differentiable at X is equal to C.So let me give a few examples of a non-continuous functionand then think about would we be able to find this limit.So the first is where you have a discontinuity.Our function is defined at C, it's equal to this value,but you can see as X becomes larger than C,it just jumps down and shifts right over here.So what would happen if you were trying to find this limit?Well, remember, all this is is a slope of a linebetween when X is some arbitrary value,let's say it's out here, so that would be X,this would be the point X comma F of X,and then this is the point C comma F of C right over here.So this is C comma F of C.So if you find the left side of the limit right over here,you're essentially saying okay, let's find this slope.And then let me get a little bit closer,and let's get X a little bit closerand then let's find this slope.And then let's get X even closer than thatand find this slope.And in all of those cases, it would be zero.The slope is zero.So one way to think about it, the derivative or this limitas we approach from the left, seems to be approaching zero.But what about if we were to take Xs to the right?So instead of our Xs being there,what if we were to take Xs right over here?Well, for this point, X comma F of X,our slope, if we take F of X minus F of Cover X minus C, that would be the slope of this line.If we get X to be even closer, let's say right over here,then this would be the slope of this line.If we get even closer, then this expressionwould be the slope of this line.And so as we get closer and closer to X being equal to C,we see that our slope is actuallyapproaching negative infinity.And most importantly, it's approachinga very different value from the right.This expression is approaching a very different valuefrom the right as it is from the left.And so in this case, this limit up here won't exist.So we can clearly say this is not differentiable.So once again, not a proof here.I'm just getting an intuition for if somethingisn't continuous, it's pretty clear, at least in this case,that it's not going to be differentiable.Let's look at another case.Let's look at a case where we have what's sometimes calleda removable discontinuity or a point discontinuity.So once again, let's say we're approaching from the left.This is X, this is the point X comma F of X.Now what's interesting is where as this expressionis the slope of the line connecting X comma F of Xand C comma F of C, which is this point, not that point,remember we have this removablediscontinuity right over here,and so this would be this expression is calculatingthe slope of that line.And then if X gets even closer to C, well, then we're gonnabe calculating the slope of that line.If X gets even closer to C, we're gonna be calculatingthe slope of that line.And so as we approach from the left, as X approaches Cfrom the left, we actually have a situationwhere this expression right over here is goingto approach negative infinity.And if we approach from the right, if we approachwith Xs larger than C, well, this is our X comma F of X,so we have a positive slope and then as we get closer,it gets more positive, more positiveapproaches positive infinity.But either way, it's not approaching a finite value.And one side is approaching positive infinity,and the other side is approaching negative infinity.This, the limit of this expression, is not going to exist.So once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof here,but try to construct a discontinuous functionwhere you will be able to find this.It is very, very hard.And you might say, well, what about the situationswhere F is not even defined at C, which for sureyou're not gonna be continuous if F is not defined at C.Well if F is not defined at C, then this partof the expression wouldn't even make sense,so you definitely wouldn't be differentiable.But now let's ask another thing.I've just given you good arguments for when you'renot continuous, you're not going to be differentiable,but can we make another claim that if you are continuous,then you definitely will be differentiable?Well, it turns out that there are for suremany functions, an infinite number of functions,that can be continuous at C, but not differentiable.So for example, this could be an absolute value function.It doesn't have to be an absolute value function,but this could be Y is equal tothe absolute value of X minus C.And why is this one not differentiable at C?Well, think about what's happening.Think about this expression.Remember, this expression all it's doing is calculatingthe slope between the point X comma F of Xand the point C comma F of C.So if X is, say, out here, this is X comma F of X,it's going to be calculated, so if we take the limitas X approaches C from the left,we'll be looking at this slope.And as we get closer, we'll be looking at this slopewhich is actually going to be the same.In this case it would be a negative one.So as X approaches C from the left,this expression would be negative one.But as X approaches C from the right,this expression is going to be one.The slope of the line that connects these points is one.The slope of the line that connects these points is one.So the limit of this expression, or I would say the valueof this expression, is approaching two different valuesas X approaches C from the left or the right.From the left, it's approaching negative one,or it's constantly negative one and so it's approachingnegative one, you could say.And from the right, it's one,and it's approaching one the entire time.And so we know if you're approaching two different valuesfrom on the left side or the right side of the limit,then this limit will not exist.So here, this is not, not differentiable.And even intuitively, we think of the derivativeas the slope of the tangent line.And you could actually draw an infinite numberof tangent lines here.That's one way to think about it.You could say, well, maybe this is the tangent lineright over there, but then why can't I makesomething like this the tangent line?That only intersects at the point C comma zero.And then you could keep doing things like that.Why can't that be the tangent line?And you could go on and on and on.So the big takeaways here, at least intuitively,in a future video I'm going to prove to youthat if F is differentiable at C that it is continuous at C,which can also be interpreted as that if you're notcontinuous at C, then you're not gonna be differentiable.These two examples will hopefully give yousome intuition for that.But it's not the case that if something is continuousthat it has to be differentiable.It oftentimes will be differentiable, but it doesn't haveto be differentiable, and this absolute value functionis an example of a continuous function at C,but it is not differentiable at C.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-differentiability/v/differentiability-at-a-point-graphical	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] The graph of function f is given below.It has a vertical tangent at the point three comma zero.Three comma zero has a vertical tangent, let me draw that.It has a vertical tangent right over there,and a horizontal tangent at the pointzero comma negative three.Zero comma negative three,so it has a horizontal tangent right over there,and also has a horizontal tangent at six comma three.Six comma three, let me drawthe horizontal tangent, just like that.Select all the x-values for which f is not differentiable.Select all that apply.F prime, f prime, I'll write it in short hand.We say no f prime underit's going to happen under three conditions.The first condition you could saywell we have a vertical tangent.Vertical tangent.Why is a vertical tangent a place whereit's hard to define our derivative?Well, remember, our derivative iswe're really trying to find our rate of change of ywith respect to x,but when you have a vertical tangent,you change your x a very small amount,you have an infinite change in y,either in the positive or the negative direction.That's one situation where you have no derivative.They tell us where we have a vertical tangent in here,where x is equal to three.We have no ...F is not differentiable at x equals threebecause of the vertical tangent.You might say what about horizontal tangents?No, horizontal tangents are completely fine.Horizontal tangents are places where the derivativeis equal to zero.F prime of six is equal to zero.F prime of zero is equal to zero.What are other scenarios?Well another scenario where you're not gonna havea defined derivative is where the graph is not continuous.Not continuous.We see right over here at x equals negative three,our graph is not continuous.X equals negative three it's not continuous.Those are thee only places where f is not differentiablethat they're giving us options on.We don't know what the graph is doingto the left or the right.These there I guess would be interesting cases.They haven't given us those choices here.We already said, at x equals 0, the derivative is zero.It's defined.It's differentiable there.At x equals six, the derivative is zero.We have a flat tangent.Once again it's defined there as well.Let's do another one of these.Actually, I didn't include, I think thatthis takes care of this problem,but there's a third scenarioin which we have, I'll call it a sharp turn.A sharp turn.This isn't the most mathy definition right over here,but it's easy to recognize.A sharp turn is something like that,or like, well no, that doesn't look too sharp,or like this.The reason why where you have these sharp bendsor sharp turns as opposed to somethingthat looks more smooth like that.The reason why we're not differentiable there isas we approach this point,as we approach this point from either side,we have different slopes.Notice our slope is positive right over here,as x increases, y is increasing,While the slope is negative here.As you're trying to find the limit of our slopeas we approach this point,it's not going to exist because it's differenton the left hand side and the right hand side.That's why the sharp turns, I don't see any sharp turns hereso it doesn't apply to this example.Let's do one more examples.Actually this one does have some sharp turns.This could be interesting.The graph of function f is given to the left right here.It has a vertical asymptote at x equals negative three,we see that,and horizontal asymptotes at y equals zero.This end of the curve as x approaches negative infinityit looks like y is approaching zero.It has another horizontal asymptote at y equals four.As x approaches infinity, it looks likeour graph is trending down to y is equal to four.Select the x values for which f is not differentiable.First of all, we could think about vertical tangents.Doesn't seem to have any vertical tangents.Then we could think about where we are not continuous.Well, we're definitely not continuouswhere we have this vertical asymptote right over here.We're not continuous at x equals negative three.We're also not continuous at x is equal to one.Then the last situation wherewe are not going to be differentiableis where we have a sharp turn,or you could kind of view it as a sharp point, on our graph.I see a sharp point right over there.Notice as we approach from the left hand side,the slope looks like a constant, I don't know,it's like a positive three halves,while as we go to the right side of thatit looks like our slope turns negative.If you were to try to find the limit of the slopeas we approach from either side,which is essentially what you're trying to dowhen you try to find the derivative,well it's not going to be definedbecause it's different from either side.F is also not differentiable at the x valuethat gives us that little sharp point right over there.If you were to graph the derivative,which we will do in future videos,you will see that the derivative is notcontinuous at that point.Let me mark that off.Then we can check x equals zero.X equals zero's completely cool.We're at a point that our tangent lineis definitely not vertical.We're definitely continuous there.We definitely do not have a sharp point or edge.We're completely cool at x equals zero.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-differentiability/v/differentiability-at-a-point-algebraic-not-differentiable	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Is the function given below continuousslash differentiable at x equals one?And they define the function g piece wiseright over here, and then theygive us a bunch of choices.Continuous but not differentiable.Differentiable but not continuous.Both continuous and differentiable.Neither continuous nor differentiable.And, like always, pause this videoand see if you could figure this out.So let's do step by step.So first let's think about continuity.So for continuity, for g to be continuous at x equals onethat means that g of one, that means g of onemust be equal to the limit as x approaches oneof g of g of x.Well g of one, what is that going to be?G of one we're going to fall into this case.One minus one squared is going to be zero.So if we can show that the limit of g of xas x approaches one is the same as g of oneis equal to zero than we know we're continuous there.Well let's do the left and right handed limits here.So if we do the left handed limit, limit,and that's especially useful 'cause we're inthese different clauses here as we approachfrom the left and the right hand side.So as x approaches one fromthe left hand side of g of x.Well we're going to be falling into this situation hereas we approach from the left as x is less than one.So this is going to be the same thing as that.That's what g of x is equal to when weare less than one as we're approaching from the left.Well this thing is defined, and it's continuousfor all real numbers.So we could just substitute one in for x,and we get this is equal to zero.So so far so good, let's do one more of these.Let's approach from the right hand side.As x approaches one from the right hand side of g of x.Well now we're falling into this caseso g of x if we're to the right of oneif values are greater or equal to oneit's gonna be x minus one squared.Well once again x minus one squaredthat is defined for all real numbers.It's continuous for all real numbers,so we could just pop that one in there.You get one minus one squared.Well that's just zero again,so the left hand limit, the right hand limitare both equal zero, which means that thelimit of g of x as x approaches one is equal to zero.Which is the same thing as g of one,so we are good with continuity.So we can rule out all of the onesthat are saying that it's not continuous.So we can rule out that one,and we can rule out that one right over there.So now let's think about whether it is differentiable.So differentiability.So differentiability, I'll write differentiability, ability.Did I, let's see, that's a long word.Differentiability, alright.Differentiability, what needs to be true here?Well we have to have a defined limitas x approaches one for f of xminus f of one over,oh let me be careful, it's not f it's g.So we need to have a defined limit for g of xminus g of oneover x minus one.And so let's just try to evaluate this limitfrom the left and right hand sides,and we can simplify it.We already know that g of one is zero.So that's just going to be zero.So we just need to find the limitas x approaches one of g of x over x minus oneor see if we can find the limit.So let's first think about the limitas we approach from the left hand sideof g of x overx minus.G of x over x minus one.Well as we approach from the left hand side,g of x is that right over there.So we could write this.Instead of writing g of x,we could write this as x minus one.X minus one over x minus one,and as long as we aren't equal to one,this thing is going to be equalas long as x does not equal one.X minus one over x minus one is just going to be one.So this limit is going to be one.So that one worked out.Now let's think about the limitas x approaches one from the right hand sideof, once again, I could write g of x of g of one,but g of one is just zero,so I'll just write g of x over x minus one.Well what's g of x now?Well it's x minus one squared.So instead of writing g of x,I could write this as x minus one squaredover x minus one,and so as long as x does not equal one,we're just doing the limit.We're saying as we approach one from the right hand side.Well, this expression right over hereyou have x minus one squared divided by x minus one,well, that's just going to give us x minus one.X minus one squared divided by x minus oneis just going to be x minus one,and this limit, well this expression right over hereis going to be continuous and defined for sure allx's that are not equaling one.Actually, let me, let me, well,it was before it was this,x minus one squared over x minus one.This thing over here, as I said, is not definedfor x equals one, but it is defined for anythingfor x does not equal one, and we're just approaching one.And, if we wanted to simplify this expression,it would get, this would just beI think I just did this,but I'm making sure I'm doing it right.This is going to be the same this as thatfor x not being equal to one.Well this is just going to be zero.We could just evaluate when x is equal to one here.This is going to be equal to zero.And so notice, you get a different limitfor this definition of the derivative as we approachfrom the left hand side or the right hand side,and that makes sense.This graph is gonna look something like,we have a slope of one, so it's gonna looksomething like this.And then right when x is equal to oneand the value of our function is zeroit looks something like this, it looks something like this.And so the graph is continuousthe graph for sure is continuous,but our slope coming into that point is one,and our slope right when we leave that point is zero.So it is not differentiable over there.So it is continuous, continuous, but not differentiable.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-power-rule/v/power-rule	khanacademy	video	:00In this video, we will cover the power rule,which really simplifies our life whenit comes to taking derivatives, especiallyderivatives of polynomials.You are probably already familiarwith the definition of a derivative,limit is delta x approaches 0 of fof x plus delta x minus f of x, all of that over delta x.And it really just comes out of tryingto find the slope of a tangent line at any given point.But we're going to see what the power rule is.It simplifies our life.We won't have to take these sometimes complicated limits.And we're not going to prove it in this video,but we'll hopefully get a sense of how to use it.And in future videos, we'll get a sense of why it makes senseand even prove it.So the power rule just tells us that if I have some function,f of x, and it's equal to some power of x, so xto the n power, where n does not equal 0.So n can be anything.It can be positive, a negative, it could be-- itdoes not have to be an integer.The power rule tells us that the derivative of this, f primeof x, is just going to be equal to n,so you're literally bringing this out front, n times x,and then you just decrement the power, times xto the n minus 1 power.So let's do a couple of examples justto make sure that that actually makes sense.So let's ask ourselves, well let's say that f of xwas equal to x squared.Based on the power rule, what is fprime of x going to be equal to?Well, in this situation, our n is 2.So we bring the 2 out front.2 times x to the 2 minus 1 power.So that's going to be 2 times x to the first power, whichis just equal to 2x.That was pretty straightforward.Let's think about the situation where,let's say we have g of x is equal to x to the third power.What is g prime of x going to be in this scenario?Well, n is 3, so we just literally pattern match here.This is-- you're probably findingthis shockingly straightforward.So this is going to be 3 times x to the 3 minus 1 power,or this is going to be equal to 3x squared.And we're done.In the next video we'll think aboutwhether this actually makes sense.Let's do one more example, just to showit doesn't have to necessarily applyto only these kind of positive integers.We could have a scenario where maybe wehave h of x. h of x is equal to x to the negative 100 power.The power rule tells us that h prime of xwould be equal to what?Well n is negative 100, so it's negative 100xto the negative 100 minus 1, whichis equal to negative 100x to the negative 101.Let's do one more.Let's say we had z of x.z of x is equal to x to the 2.571 power.And we are concerned with what is z prime of x?Well once again, power rule simplifies our life,n it's 2.571, so it's going to be2.571 times x to the 2.571 minus 1 power.So it's going to be equal to-- letme make sure I'm not falling off the bottom of the page--2.571 times x to the 1.571 power.Hopefully, you enjoyed that.And in the next few videos, we will not onlyexpose you to more properties of derivatives,we'll get a sense for why the power rule at least makesintuitive sense.And then also prove the power rule for a few cases.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-power-rule/v/power-rule-with-rewriting	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois get some practice taking derivatives with the power rule.So let's say we take the derivativewith respect to x of one over x.What is that going to be equal to?Pause this video and try to figure it out.So at first, you might say,""How does the power rule apply here?""The power rule, just to remind ourselves,it tells us that if we're takingthe derivative of x to the n with respect to x,so if we're taking the derivative of that,that that's going to be equal to,we take the exponent, bring it out front,and we've proven it in other videos,but this is gonna be n times x to the,and then we decrement the exponent.So, n minus one.But this does not look like that,and the key is to appreciate that one over xis the same thing as x to the negative one.So, this is going to be the derivativewith respect to x of x to the negative one.And now, this looks a lot morelike what you might be used to,where this is going to be equal to,you take our exponent, bring it out front,so it's negative one,times x to the negative one minus one,negative one minus one.And so, this is going to be equalto negative x to the negative two,and we're done.Let's do another example.Let's say that we're told that f of xis equal to the cube root of xand we wanna figure out what f prime of x is equal to.Pause the video and see if you can figure it out again.Well, once again, you might say,""Hey, how do I take the derivative of something like this,""especially if my goal or if I'm thinking that maybe""the power rule might be useful?""And the idea is to rewrite this as an exponent,if you can rewrite the cube root as x to the 1/3 power.And so, the derivative, you take the 1/3,bring it out front, so it's 1/3x to the 1/3 minus one power.And so, this is going to be 1/3times x to the 1/3 minus oneis negative 2/3,negative 2/3 power, and we are done.And hopefully through these examples,you're seeing that the power rule is incredibly powerful.You can tackle a far broader range of derivativesthan you might have initially thought.Let's do another example,and I'll make this one really nice and hairy.Let's say we wanna figure out the derivativewith respect to x of the cube rootof x squared.What is this going to be?And actually,let's just not figure out what the derivative is,let's figure out the derivative at x equals eight.Pause this video again and see if you can figure that out.Well, what we're gonna dois first just figure out what this isand then we're going evaluate it at x equals eight.And the key thing to appreciate is this is the same thing,and we're just gonna do what we did up hereas the derivative with respect to x.Instead of saying the cube root of x squared,we can say this is x squared to the 1/3 power,which is the same thing as the derivativewith respect to x of,well, x squared, if I raise something to an exponentand then raise that to an exponent,I can just take the product of the exponents.And so, this is gonna be x to the two times 1/3 poweror to the 2/3 power.And now, this is just going to be equal to,I'll do it right over here, bring the 2/3 out front,2/3 times x to the, what's 2/3 minus one?Well, that's 2/3 minus 3/3or it would be negative 1/3 power.Now, we wanna know what happens at x equals eight,so let's just evaluate that.That's going to be 2/3 times x is equal to eightto the negative 1/3 power.Well, what's eight to the 1/3 power?Eight to the 1/3 power is going to be equal to two,and so, eight to the negative 1/3 power is 1/2.Actually, let me just do that step-by-step.So, this is going to be equal to 2/3 times,we could do it this way, one over eight to the 1/3 power.And so, this is just one over two,2/3 times 1/2,well, that's just going to be equal to 1/3, and we're done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivative-rules-constant-sum-difference-and-constant-multiple/v/derivative-properties-and-polynomial-derivatives	khanacademy	video	:00Now that we know the power rule, and we saw thatin the last video, that the derivative with respectto x, of x to the n, is going to be equal to n times x to the nminus 1 for n not equal 0.I thought I would expose you to a few more rules or conceptsor properties of derivatives that essentially will allowus to take the derivative of any polynomial.So this is powerful stuff going on.So the first thing I want to think aboutis, why this little special case for n not equaling 0?What happens if n equals 0?So let's just think of the situation.Let's try to take the derivative with respectto x of x to the 0 power.Well, what is x to the 0 power going to be?And we can assume that x for this case right over hereis not equal to 0.0 to the 0, weird things happen at that point.But if x does not equal 0, what isx to the 0 power going to be?Well, this is the same thing as the derivative with respectto x of 1.x to the 0 power is just going to be 1.And so what is the derivative with respect to x of 1?And to answer that question, I'll just graph it.I'll just graph f of x equals 1 to makeit a little bit clearer.So that's my y-axis.This is my x-axis.And let me graph y equals 1, or f of x equals 1.So that's 1 right over there. f of xequals 1 is just a horizontal line.So that right over there is the graph,y is equal to f of x, which is equal to 1.Now, remember the derivative, one way to conceptualizeis just the slope of the tangent line at any point.So what is the slope of the tangent line at this point?And actually, what's the slope at every point?Well, this is a line, so the slope doesn't change.It has a constant slope.And it's a completely horizontal line.It has a slope of 0.So the slope at every point over here,slope is going to be equal to 0.So the slope of this line at any pointis just going to be equal to 0.And that's actually going to be true for any constant.The derivative, if I had a function, let's say that f of xis equal to 3.Let's say that's y is equal to 3.What's the derivative of y with respectto x going to be equal to?And I'm intentionally showing you all the different waysof the notation for derivatives.So what's the derivative of y with respect to x?It can also be written as y prime.What's that going to be equal to?Well, it's the slope at any given point.And you see that no matter what x you're looking at,the slope here is going to be 0.So it's going to be 0.So it's not just x to the 0.If you take the derivative of any constant,you're going to get 0.So let me write that.Derivative with respect to x of any constant--so let's say of a where this is just a constant, that'sgoing to be equal to 0.So pretty straightforward idea.Now let's explore a few more properties.Let's say I want to take the derivative with respectto x of-- let's use the same A. Let's sayI have some constant times some function.Well, derivatives work out quite well.You can actually take this little scalar multiplier,this little constant, and take it out of the derivative.This is going to be equal to A. I didn'twant to do that magenta color.It's going to be equal to A times the derivative of f of x.Let me do that blue color.And the other way to denote the derivative of f of xis to just say that this is the same thing.This is equal to A times this thing right over hereis the exact same thing as f prime of x.Now this might all look like really fancy notation,but I think if I gave you an exampleit might make some sense.So what about if I were to ask you the derivative with respectto x of 2 times x to the fifth power?Well, this property that I just articulatedsays, well, this is going to be the same thing as 2times the derivative of x to the fifth, 2 times the derivativewith respect to x of x to the fifth.Essentially, I could just take this scalar multiplierand put it in front of the derivative.So this right here, this is the derivativewith respect to x of x to the fifth.And we know how to do that using the power rule.This is going to be equal to 2 times-- let me write that.I want to keep it consistent with the colors.This is going to be 2 times the derivative of x to the fifth.Well, the power rule tells us, n is 5.It's going to be 5x to the 5 minus 1 or 5xto the fourth power.So it's going to be 5x to the fourth power, whichis going to be equal to 2 times 5 is 10, x to the fourth.So 2x to the fifth, you can literally justsay, OK, the power rule tells me derivativeof that is 5x to the fourth.5 times 2 is 10.So that simplifies our life a good bit.We can now, using the power rule and this one property,take the derivative anything thattakes the form Ax to the n power.Now let's think about another very usefulderivative property.And these don't just apply to the power rule,they apply to any derivative.But they are especially useful for the power rulebecause it allows us to construct polynomials and takethe derivatives of them.But if I were to take the derivativeof the sum of two functions-- so the derivative of,let's say one function is f of x and thenthe other function is g of x.It's lucky for us that this ends upbeing the same thing as the derivative of fof x plus the derivative of g of x.So this is the same thing as f-- actually,let me use that derivative operator just to make it clear.It's the same thing as the derivative with respectto x of f of x plus the derivative with respectto x of g of x.So we'll put f of x right over hereand put g of x right over there.And so with the other notation, wecan say this is going to be the same thing.Derivative with respect to x of f of x, we can write as fprime of x.And the derivative with respect to x of g of x,we can write as g prime of x.Now, once again, this might look like kind of fancy notationto you.But when you see an example, it'll make it pretty clear.If I want to take the derivative with respectto x of let's say x to the third powerplus x to the negative 4 power, this justtells us that the derivative of the sumis just the sum of the derivatives.So we can take the derivative of this term using the power rule.So it's going to be 3x squared.And to that, we can add the derivative of this thing rightover here.So it's going to be plus-- that'sa different shade of blue-- and over here is negative 4.So it's plus negative 4 times x to the negative 4 minus 1,or x to the negative 5 power.So we have-- and I could just simplify a little bit.This is going to be equal to 3x squaredminus 4x to the negative 5.And so now we have all the tools we need in our toolkitto essentially take the derivative of any polynomial.So let's give ourselves a little practice there.So let's say that I have-- and I'll do it in white.Let's say that f of x is equal to 2xto the third power minus 7x squared plus 3x minus 100.What is f prime of x?What is the derivative of f with respect to x going to be?Well, we can use the properties that we just said.The derivative of this is just goingto be 2 times the derivative of x to the third.Derivative of x to the third is going to be 3x squared,so it's just going to be 2 times 3x squared.What's the derivative of negative 7xsquared going to be?Well, it's just going to be negative 7 timesthe derivative of x squared, which is 2x.What is the derivative of 3x going to be?Well, it's just going to be 3 times the derivative of x,or 3 times the derivative of x to the first.The derivative of x to the first is just 1.So this is just going to be plus 3 times--we could say 1x to the 0-- but that's just 1.And then finally, what's the derivative of a constantgoing to be?Let me do that in a different color.What's the derivative of a constant going to be?Well, we covered that at the beginning of this video.The derivative of any constant is justgoing to be 0, so plus 0.And so now we are ready to simplify.The derivative of f is going to be2 times 3x squared is just 6x squared.Negative 7 times 2x is negative 14x plus 3.And we don't have to write the 0 there.And we're done.We now have all the properties in our tool beltto find the

We've been givensome interesting information hereabout the functions f, g, and h.For f, they tell us for given values of xwhat f of x is equal toand what f prime of x is equal to.Then they defined g of x for usin terms of this kind of absolute value expression.Then they define h of x for us,in terms of both f of x and g of x.What we're curious about is what is the derivativewith respect to x, of h of x at x is equal to nine.I encourage you to pause this videoand think about it on your ownbefore I work through it.Let's think about it a little bit.Another way just to get familiar with the notationof writing this, the derivative of h of xwith respect to x at x equals nine.This is equivalent to h, we need that blue color,it is equivalent to h primeand the prime signifies that we're taking the derivative.H prime of x, when x equals nineso h prime of nine is what this really is.Actually I'm going to do this in a different color.This is h prime of nine.Let's think about what that is.Let's take the derivative of both sidesof this expressionto figure out what the derivative with respect to x of h is.We get a derivative, I'll do that same white color.A derivative with respect to x of h of xis going to be equal to the derivative with respect to xof all of this business.I could actually just, well I'll just rewrite it.Three times f of x, plus two times g of x.Now this right over here,the derivative of the sum of two termsthat's going to be the same thingas the sum of the derivatives of each of the terms.This is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to xof three times, I'll write that a little bit neater.Three times f of x, plus the derivative with respect to xof two times g of x.Now the derivative of a numberor I guess you could say a scaling factor times a function.The derivative of a scalar times the functionis the same thing as a scalar timesthe derivative of the function.What does that mean?Well that just means that this first term right over herethat's going to be equivalent tothree times the derivative with respect to xof f, of our f of x,plus this part over here is the same thing as two.Okay, make sure I don't run out of space here,plus two times the derivative with respect to x.The derivative with respect to x of g of x.Derivative of h with respect to xis equal to three times the derivativeof f with respect to x,plus two times the derivative of g with respect to x.If we want to write it in this kind of prime notation here,we could rewrite it as h prime of x is equal tothree times f prime of x,so this part right over herethat is the same thing as f prime of x.It's three times f prime of x, plus two times g prime of x.Once you are more fluent with this property,the derivative of the sum of two thingsis the sum of the derivatives.The derivative of a scalar times somethingis the same thing as a scalar times the derivativeof that something.You really could have gone straight from hereto here, pretty quickly.Now why is this interesting,well now we can evaluate this functionwhen x is equal to nine.H prime of nine is the same thingas three times f prime of nine,plus two times g prime of nine.Now what is f prime of nine?The derivative of our function fwhen x is equal to nine.Well they tell us, when x is equal to nine,f of nine is onebut more importantly f prime of nine is three.This part right over here evaluates that part's three.What's g prime of nine?Let's look at this function a little bit more closely.There's a couple of ways we could think about it.Actually let's try to graph it,now I think that could be interesting.Just to visualize what's going on here.Let's say that's our y-axisand do this right over here is our x-axis.Now when does an absolute value function like this,when is this going to hit a minimum point?Well the absolute value of somethingis always going to be non-negative.It hits a minimum point when this thing is equal to zero.Well when is this thing equal to zero?When x equals one, this thing is equal to zero.We hit a minimum point when x is equal to one,and when x equals one, this term is zeroabsolute value of zero, zero.G of one is one.We have this point right over there.Now what happens after that?What happens for x greater than one?Actually let me write this down.G of x is equal to,and in general whenever you have an absolute value,a relatively simple absolute value function like thisyou could think of it, you could break it upinto two functionor you could think about this functionover different intervalswhen the absolute value is non-negativeand when the absolute value is negative.When the absolute value is non-negativethat's when x is greater than or equal to zero.When the absolute value is non-negative,if you're taking the absolute value of a non-negative numberthat is just going to be itself.The absolute value of zero, zero.Absolute value of one is one.The absolute value of a hundred is a hundred.Then you could ignore the absolute valuefor x is greater than or equal to,not greater than or equal to zero,for x is greater than or equal to one.X is greater than or equal to one,this thing right over here is non-negative.It will just evaluate to x minus one.This is going to be x minus one plus one.Which is the same thing as just x,minus one plus one, they just cancel out.Now when this term right over here is negativeand that's going to happen for x is less than one.Well then the absolute valueis going to be the opposite of it.You give me the absolute value of a negative numberthat's going to be the opposite.Absolute value of negative eight is positive eight.It's going to be that the negative of x minus oneis one minus x, plus one.Or we could say two minus x.For x is greater or equal to one,we would look at this expression,now what's the slope of that?Well the slope of that is one.We're going to have a curve that looks likeor a line I guess we could say that looks like this.For all x is greater than or equal to one.The important thing, remember,we're going to think about the slope of the tangent linewhen we think about the derivative of g.Slope is equal to one.For x less than one or our slope now,if we look right over hereour slope is negative one.It's going to look like this.It's going to look like that.For the pointing question,if we're thinking about g prime of nineso nine is some place out here,so what is g prime of nine?G prime of nine, let me make it clear,this graph right over here,this is the graph of g of xor we could say y, this is the graph y equals g of x.Y is equal to g of x.What is g prime of nine?Well that's the slope when x is equal to nine.The slope is going to be equal to one.G prime of nine is one.What does this evaluate to?This is going to be three times three,so this part right over here is nineplus two times one, plus two, which is equal to 11.The slope of the tangent line of hwhen x is equal to nine is 11.

[Voiceover] So I have the function F of X hereand we're defining it using a polynomial expression.And what I would like to do here istake the derivative of our functionwhich is essentially gonna make us takethe derivative of this polynomial expressionand we're gonna take the derivativewith respect to X.So the first thing I'm gonna do islet's take the derivative of both sides.So we can say the derivative with respect to Xof F of Xof F of Xis equal to the derivativewith respect to Xthe derivative with respect to Xof X to the fifthX to the fifthplus twoplus two X to the thirdminus X squared.And so the notation, just to get familiar with ityou could do this as the derivative operator.This is, I want to take the derivativeof whatever's inside of the parentheseswith respect to X.So the derivative of F with respect to Xwe could use the notationbut that is just F prime ofF prime of X.And that is going to be equal to.Now here we can use our derivative properties.The derivative of the sum or differenceof a bunch of things.The derivative of is equal to the sumof the difference of the derivative of each of them.So this is equal to the derivativelet me just, with the derivative with respect to Xof each of these three things.So the derivative with respect to X.Let me just write it out like this.Of that first termplus the derivative with respect to Xof that second termminus the derivative with respect to Xof that third term.Of that third term.And I'll color code it here.So here I had an X of the fifthso I'll put the X to fifthX of the fifth there.Here I had a two X to the third.So I'll put the two X to the third there.And here I have a X squaredI'm subtracting an X squaredso I'm subtracting the derivative with respect to Xof X squared.So notice all that's happening here isI'm taking the derivative individually ofeach of these terms and then I'm addingor subtracting in the same way that the termswere added or subtracted.And so what is this going to be equal to?Well, this is going to be equal tofor X of the fifthwe can just use the power rule.We can bring the five out frontand decrement the exponent by oneso it becomes five Xwe can say to the five minus one power.Which of course, is just four.And then for this second onewe could do it in a few steps.Actually, let me just write it out here.So I could writeI could write the derivativewith respect to Xof two X to the third poweris the same thingit's equal tothe same, we could bring the constant out.The derivative with, two times the derivativewith respect to Xof X to the third power.This is one of ourthis is one of our derivative properties.The derivative of a constanttimes some expressionis the same thing as a constanttimes the derivative of that expression.And what will the derivative with respect to Xto the third be?Well, we would bring the three out frontand decrement the exponent.And so this would be equal tothis twotimes the threetimes X to the three minus one power.Which is, of course, the second power.So this would give us six X squared.So, another way that you could have done itI could just writeI could just write a six X squared here.So I could just, so this is going to besix X squared.And, instead of going through all of thisyou'll learn as you do more of these,that you could have done this pretty muchin your head.Say look, I have the three out here as an exponent.Let me multiply the three times this coefficientbecause that's what we ended up doing anyway.Three times the coefficient is six Xand then three minus one is two.So you didn't necessarily have to do thisbut it's nice to see that this comes out ofthe derivative properties that we talk aboutin other videos.And then finally,we have minus.And we use thepower rule right over here.So, bring the two out frontand decrement the exponent.So it's gonna be two.It's going to betwo times Xto the two minus one powerwhich is just one.Which, we could just write as two X.So just like that we have been ableto figure out the derivative of F.And you might say, well what this thing now?Well now we have an expression that tells usthe slope of the tangent line.Or you could view it as the instantaneousrate of change with respect to Xfor any X value.So, if I were to sayif I were to now to sayF prime, let's say F prime of two.This would tell me what isthe slope of the tangent line of our functionwhen X is equal to two.And I do that by using this expression.So this is gonna befive times two to the fourthplus plussix times two squared.Six times two squared.Minus minustwo times two.Minus two times two.And this is going to be equal tolet's see, two to the fourth power is 16,16 times five is 80.And that's 80, and thenthis is six times four,which is 24.And then we are going to subtract four.So this is 80 plus 24 is 104minus four is equal to 100.So, when X is equal to twothis curve is really steep.The slope is 100.If you look, if you were to graphthe tangent line when X is equal to twofor every positive movement in the X-directionby one you're gonna move up in the Y-directionby 100.So it's really steep there and it makes sense.This is a pretty high degree.X to the fifth power and then we're adding thatto another high degreeX to the third power.And then we're subtracting a lower degree.So that's what you would expect.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivatives-of-cosx-sinx-and-lnx/v/sine-and-cosine-differentiation	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] What we want to do is find thederivative of this G of Xand at first it can look intimidating.We have a sine of X here.We have a cosine of X.We have this crazy expression herewith a pi over cube root of Xwe're squaring the whole thingand at first it might seem intimidating.But as we'll see in this video, we canactually do this with the tools already in our tool kit.Using our existing derivative propertiesusing what we know about the power rulewhich tells us the derivative with respect to X.Of X to the Nis equal to Ntimes X to the N minus one,we've see that multiple times.We also need to use the factthat the derivative of cosine of Xis equal to negative the sine of X.And the other way aroundthe derivative with respect to Xof sine of Xis equal to positivecosine of X.So using just that we can actually evaluate this.Or evaluate G prime of X.So, pause the video and see if you can do it.So probably the most intimidating part of thisbecause we know the derivative's a sineof X and cosine of X is this expression here.And we can just rewrite thisor simplify it a little bit so it takes a formthat you might be a little bit more familiar with.So, so let me just do thison the side here.So, pipi overthe cube root of Xsquared.Well that's the same thing.This is equal to pi squaredover the cube root of X squared.This is just exponent propertiesthat we're dealing with.And so this is the same thing.We're gonna take X to the one third powerand then raise that to the second power.So this is equal to pi squaredover.Let me write it this way,I'm not gonna skip any stepsbecause this is a good review of exponent property.X to the one third squared.Which is the same thing as pi squaredover X to the two thirds power.Which is the same thing as pi squaredtimes X to the negative two thirds power.So when you write it like thisit starts to get into a formula,you're like, oh, I can see how the power rulecould apply there.So this thing is just pi squaredtimes X to the negative two thirds power.So actually let me delete this.So,this thingcan be rewritten.This thing can be rewrittenas pi squaredtimes X to the negativeto the negative two thirds power.So now let's take the derivativeof each of these pieces of this expression.So, we're gonna takewe want to evaluate what the G prime of X is.So G prime of Xis going to be equal to.You could view it as a derivative with respectto X of seven sine of X.Sowe can take do the derivative operatoron both sides here just to make it clearwhat we're doing.So we're gonna apply it there.We're gonna apply it there.And we're going to apply itthere.So this derivativethis is the same thing asthis is going to be seven times the derivativeof sine of X.So this is just gonna be seven timescosine of X.This one, over here,this is gonna be three, or we're subtracting,so it's gonna be this subtractthis minus.We can bring the constant outthat we're multiplying the expression by.And the derivative of cosine of Xso it's minus three timesthe derivative of cosine of Xis negative sine of X.Negative sine of X.And then finallyhere in the yellow we just apply the power rule.So, we have the negative two thirds,actually, let's not forget this minus signI'm gonna write it out here.So you have the negative two thirds.You multiply the exponent times the coefficient.It might look confusing, pi squared,but that's just a number.So it's gonna benegativeand then you have negative two thirdstimes pi squared.Times pi squared.Times X to the negative two thirdsminus one power.Negative two thirdsminus one power.So what is this going to be?So we get G prime of Xis equal tois equal toseven cosine of X.And let's see, we have a negative threetimes a negative sine of X.So that's a positive three sine of X.And thenwe have, we're subtractingbut then this is going to be a negative,so that's going to be a positive.So we can sayplus two pi squared over three.Two pi squared over three.That's that part there.Times Xto the.So negative two thirdsminus one,we could say negative one and two thirds,or we could say negative five thirds by power.Negative five thirds power.And there you have it.We were able to tackle this thing thatlooked a little bit hairybut all we had to use was the power ruleand what we knew to be the derivativesof sine and cosine.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-derivatives-of-cosx-sinx-and-lnx/v/derivative-of-lnx	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] In this video, we're going to thinkabout what the derivative with respect to xof the natural log of x's.And I'm gonna go straight to the punch line.It is equal to one over x.In a future video, I'm actually going to prove this.It's a little bit involved.But in this one, we're just going to appreciatethat this seems like it is actually true.So right here is the graphof y is equal to the natural log of x.And just to feel good about the statement,let's try to approximatewhat the slope of the tangent line is at different points.So let's say right over here,when x is equal to one,what does the slope of the tangent line look like?Well, it looks like here,the slope looks like it is equal,pretty close to being equal to one,which is consistent with the statement.If x is equal to one, one over one is still one,and that seems like what we see right over there.What about when x is equal to two?Well, this point right over here is the natural log of two,but more interestingly, what's the slope here?Well, it looks like,let's see, if I try to draw a tangent line,the slop of the tangent line looks pretty close to 1/2.Well, once again, that is one over x.One over two is 1/2.Let's keep doing this.If I go right over here, when x is equal to four,this point is four comma natural log of four,but the slope of the tangent line herelooks pretty close to 1/4and if you accept this, it is exactly 1/4,and you could even go to values less than one.Right over here, when x is equal to 1/2,one over 1/2, the slope should be two.And it does indeed, let me do thisin a slightly different color,it does indeed look like the slope is two over there.So once again, you take the derivativewith respect to x of the natural log of x, it is one over x.And hopefully, you get a sensethat that is actually true here.In a future video, we'll actually prove it.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-product-rule/v/applying-the-product-rule-for-derivatives	khanacademy	video	:00What we will talk about in this videois the product rule, which is oneof the fundamental ways of evaluating derivatives.And we won't prove it in this video,but we will learn how to apply it.And all it tells us is that if we have a function thatcan be expressed as a product of two functions-- so let'ssay it can be expressed as f of x times g of x-- and wewant to take the derivative of this function,that it's going to be equal to the derivative of oneof these functions, f prime of x--let's say the derivative of the first one timesthe second function plus the first function,not taking its derivative, times the derivativeof the second function.So here we have two terms.In each term, we took the derivative of oneof the functions and not the other,and we multiplied the derivative of the first functiontimes the second function plus justthe first function times the derivativeof the second function.Now let's see if we can actually apply this to actually findthe derivative of something.So let's say we are dealing with-- I don't know--let's say we're dealing with x squared times cosine of x.Or let's say-- well, yeah, sure.Let's do x squared times sine of x.Could have done it either way.And we are curious about taking the derivative of this.We are curious about what its derivative is.Well, we might immediately recognizethat this is the product of-- thiscan be expressed as a product of two functions.We could set f of x is equal to x squared,so that is f of x right over there.And we could set g of x to be equal to sine of x.And there we have it.We have our f of x times g of x.And we could think about what these individual derivativesare.The derivative of f of x is just going to be equal to 2xby the power rule, and the derivative of g of xis just the derivative of sine of x,and we covered this when we just talkedabout common derivatives.Derivative of sine of x is cosine of x.And so now we're ready to apply the product rule.This is going to be equal to f prime of x times g of x.So f prime of x-- the derivative of fis 2x times g of x, which is sine of x plus justour function f, which is x squaredtimes the derivative of g, times cosine of x.And we're done.We just applied the product rule.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-product-rule/v/differentiating-products	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] So let's see if we can findthe derivative with respect to x,with either x times the cosine of x.And like always, pause this videoand give it a go on your ownbefore we work through it.So when you look at this you might say,""well, I know how to find""the derivative with e to the x,""that's infact just e to the x.And let me write this down.We know a few things.We know the derivative with respect to x ofe to the x.E to the x is e to the x.We know how to find the derivative cosine of x.The derivative with respect to x of cosine of xis equal to negative sine of x.But, how do we find the derivative of their product?Well as you can imagine, this might involvethe product rule.And let me just write downthe product rule generally first.So if we take the derivative with respect to xof the first expression in terms of x,so this is, we could call this u of x timesanother expression that involves x.So u times v of x.This is going to be equal to,and I'm color-coding it so we can reallykeep track of things.This is going to be equal to the derivativeof the first expression.So I could write that as u prime of xtimes just the second expression not the derivative of it,just the second expression.So times v of x and then we have plusthe first expression, not its derivative,just the first expression.U of x times the derivative of the second expression.Times the derivative of the second expression.So the way you remember it is,you have these two things here,you're going to end up with two different terms.In each of them, you're going to takethe derivative of one of them, but not the other one,and then the other one you'll take the derivative ofthe other one, but not the first one.So, the derivative of u times v is u prime times v,plus u times v prime.When you just look at it like that,it seems a little bit abstract andthat might even be a little bit confusing,but that's why we have a tangible example hereand I color-coded intentionally.We could say that u of x is equal to e to the x.And v of x is equal to the cosine of x.So v of x is equal to cosine of x.And if u of x is equal to e to the x,we know that the derivative of thatwith respect to x is still e to the x.That's one of the most magical things in mathematics.One of the things that makes e so special.So u prime of x is still equal to e to the x.And v prime of x,we know as negative sine of x.Negative sine of x, and so,what's this going to be equal to?This is going to be equal tothe derivative of the first expression.So, the derivative of e to the x which is just,e to the x, times the second expression,not taking it's derivative, so times cosine of x.Plus the first expression,not taking its derivative, so e to the x,times the derivative of the second expression.So, times the derivative of cosine of xwhich is negative sine.Negative sine of x.And it might be a little bit confusing,because e to the x is its own derivative.This right over here, you can view this asthis was the derivative as e to the xwhich happens to be e to the x.That's what's exciting about that expression,or that function.And then this is just e to the x without takingit's derivative - they are of course, the same thing.But anyway, now we can just simplify it.This is going to be equal to...We could write either as e to the x times cosine of x,times cosine of x minus e to the x.E to the x times sine of x.Times sine of x.Or, if you want, you could factor outan e to the x.This is the same thing ase to the x times cosine of x minus sine of x.Cosine of x minus sine of x.So hopefully this makes the product rulea little bit more tangible.And once you have this in your tool belt,there's a whole broader class of functionsand expressions that we can start to differentiate."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-product-rule/v/product-rule-example-implicit	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] The following tables lists the valuesof functions f and h, and of their derivatives,f prime and h prime for x is equal to three.So all this is telling us,with x is equal to three,the value of the function is six, f of three is six,you could view it that way.h of three is zero, f prime of three is six,and h prime of three is four.And now they want us to evaluate the derivativewith respect to x of the product of f of x and h of xwhen x is equal to three.One way you could view this is,if we viewed some function,if we viewed some function g of x.g of x as being equal to the product of f of xand h of x,this expression is the derivative of g of x.So we could write g prime of x is equal to the derivativewith respect to xof f of xtimes h of x.Which is what we see right here,and which is what we want to evaluate at x equals three.So we essentially want to evaluateg primeof three.This is what they're asking us to do.Well, to do that, let's go first up here.Let's just think about what this is doing.They're asking us to take the derivativewith respect to x of the product of two functionsthat we have some information about.Well, if we're taking the derivative of the productof two functions, you could imagine that theproduct rule could prove useful here.So I'm just gonna restate the product rule.This is going to be equal to the derivativeof the first function,f prime of x,times the second function, not taking its derivative.Plus the first function, not taking its derivative,f of x, times the derivative of the second function,h prime of x.So if you're trying to find g prime of three,well that's just going to bef prime of three times h of threeplus f of threetimes h prime of three.And lucky for us, they give us what all these thingsevaluate to.f prime of three, right over here, they tell us.f prime when x is equal to three is equal to six.So this right over here is six.h of three, they give us that, too.h of three, when x is three, the value of ourfunction is zero.So this is zero.So this first term is you just get six times zero,which is gonna be zero, but we'll get to that.Now f of three.f of three.Well, the function when x is equal to three,f of three is equal to six.So that is six.And then finally,h prime evaluated at three,h prime of x when x is equal to three,h prime of x is equal to four.Or you could say this is h prime of three.So this is four.And so there you have it.This is going to evaluate to six times zero,which, that's all just gonna be zero,plus six times four,which is going to be equal to 24.And we're done.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-quotient-rule/v/quotient-rule-example	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let f be a function such thatf of negative one is equal to three,f prime of negative one is equal to five.Let g be the function g of x isequal to two x to the third power.Let capital F be a function defined as,so capital F is defined as lowercase f of xdivided by lowercase g of x, and they want usto evaluate the derivative of capital Fat x equals negative one.So the way that we can do that is,let's just take the derivative of capital F,and then evaluate it at x equals one.And the way they've set up capital F,this function definition, we can see thatit is a quotient of two functions.So if we want to take it's derivative,you might say, well, maybe thequotient rule is important here.And I'll always give you my aside.The quotient rule, I'm gonna state it right now,it could be useful to know it,but in case you ever forget it,you can derive it pretty quicklyfrom the product rule, and if you know it,the chain rule combined, you canget the quotient rule pretty quick.But let me just state the quotient rule right now.So if you have some function defined assome function in the numeratordivided by some function in the denominator,we can say its derivative, and this isreally just a restatement of the quotient rule,its derivative is going to be the derivative of thefunction of the numerator, so d, dx,f of x, times the function in the denominator,so times g of x, minus the function in the numerator,minus f of x, not taking its derivative,times the derivative in the function of the denominator,d, dx, g of x, all of that over,so all of this is going to be overthe function in the denominator squared.So this g of x squared, g of x, g of x squared.And you can use different types of notation here.You could say, instead of writing this witha derivative operator, you could say this isthe same thing as g prime of x, and likewise,you could say, well that is the same thing as f prime of x.And so now we just want to evaluate this thing,and you might say, wait, how do I evaluate this thing?Well, let's just try it.Let's just say we want to evaluate F primewhen x is equal to negative one.So we can write F prime of negative one is equal to,well everywhere we see an x, let's put a negative one here.It's going to be f prime of negative one,lowercase f prime, that's a little confusing,lowercase f prime of negative one times g of negative one,g of negative one minus f of negative onetimes g prime of negative one.All of that over, we'll do that in the same color,so take my color seriously.Alright, all of that over g of negative one squared.Now can we figure out what F prime of negative onef of negative one, g of negative one,and g prime of negative one, what they are?Well some of them, they tell us outright.They tell us f and f prime at negative one,and for g, we can actually solve for those.So, let's see, if this is, let'sfirst evaluate g of negative one.G of negative one is going to be twotimes negative one to the third power.Well negative one to the third power is just negative one,times two, so this is negative two,and g prime of x, I'll do it here, g prime of x.Let's use the power rule, bring that three out front,three times two is six, x, decrement that exponent,three minus one is two, and so g prime of negative oneis equal to six times negative one squared.Well negative one squared is just one,so this is going to be equal to six.So we actually know what all of these values are now.We know, so first we wanna figure outf prime of negative one.Well they tell us that right over here.F prime of negative one is equal to five.So that is five.G of negative one, well we figured that right here.G of negative one is negative two.So this is negative two.F of negative one, so f of negative one,they tell us that right over there.That is equal to three.And then g prime of negative one,just circle it in this green color,g prime of negative one, we figured it out.It is equal to six.So this is equal to six.And then finally, g of negative one right over here.We already figured that out.That was equal to negative two.So this is all going to simplify to...So you have five times negative two,which is negative 10, minus three times six,which is 18, all of that over negative two squared.Well negative two squared is just going to be positive four.So this is going to be equal tonegative 28 over positive four,which is equal to negative seven.And there you have it.It looks intimidating at first,but just say, okay, look.I can use the quotient rule right over here,and then once I apply the quotient rule,I can actually just directly figure outwhat g of negative one, g prime of negative one,and they gave us f of negative one,f prime of negative one, so hopefully you find that helpful.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-quotient-rule/v/rational-functions-differentiation	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] Let's say thaty is equal to five minus three x over x squared plus three xAnd we want to figure outwhat's the derivative of y in respect to x.Now it might immediately jump out at you that look,y is being defined as a rational expression hereas the quotient of two different expressions.We could even view this as two different functions.You could view this one up here as u of x,so you could say this is the same thing,this is the same thing as u of x, over,you could view the one in the denominator as v of x.That one right there is v of xand so if you're taking the derivative of somethingthat can be expressed in this way,as the quotient of two different functions,well then you could use the quotient rule.I'll give you my little aside, like I always dothe quotient rule, if you ever forget itit can be derived from the product ruleand we have videos there,cause the product rule's a bit easier to remember.But what I can do is just say,""look, dy dx, if y is just u of x over v of x"",I'm just gonna restate the quotient rule.This is going to be, this is going to bethe derivative of the function in the numerator, so.d, dx of u of xtimes the function in the denominatortimes v of x minus, I'll do theminus the function in the numerator, u of x,times the derivative of the function in the denominatortimes d dx, v of xand we're almost thereand then over, over the function in the denominator squaredthe function in the denominator squared.So this might look messy but all we have to do nowis think about what is the derivative of u of x?What is the derivative of v of x?And we should just be able to substitute those thingsback into this expression we just wrote down.So let's do that.So the derivative with respect to x of u of x, of u of xis equal to, let's see, five minus three x.The derivative of five is zero.The derivative of negative three x,well that's just gonna be negative three.That's just negative three.If any of that look completely unfamiliar to youI encourage you to review the derivative propertiesand maybe the power rule.Now let's think about what is the derivativewith respect to x, derivative with respect to x,of v of x, of v of x?Well derivative of x squared,we just bring that exponent out front,it's gonna be two times x to the two minus oneor two x to the first power or just two xand then the derivative of three x is just three.So two x plus three.Now we know everything we need to substitute back in here.The derivative of u with respect to x,this right over here is just negative three.V of x, this we know is x squared plus three x.We know that this right over here is v of x.And then u of x we know is five minus three x.Five minus three x.The derivative of v with respect to xwe know is two x plus three, two x plus three.And then finally v of x, we know is x squared plus three x.So this is x squared plus three xand so what do we get?Well we are going to get, it's gonna look a little bit hairyIt's going to be equal to negativeI'll focus this so first we have this business up here.Negative three times x squared plus three x.So I'm just gonna distribute the negative three.So it's negative three x squared minus nine xand then from that we are going to subtractthe product of these two expressions and so let's see,what is that going to be?Well, we have a five times two x,which is ten xa five times three which is 15we have a negative three x times two xso that is going to be negative six x squaredminus six x squared, and then a negative three x times threeso negative nine x.And let's see we can simplify that a little bit.Ten x minus nine x,well that's just going to leave us with x.So ten x minus nine x is just going to be xand then in our denominator, we're almost there.In our denominator we could just write that asx plus three x, x squared plus three x squaredor if we want we could expand it out,I'll just leave it like thatx squared plus three x squaredand so if we wanna simplifyor attempt to simplify this a little bit.It's going to be negative three x squared minus nine xand then you're gonna have a negative minus xminus x and then minus 15and then minus negative six x squaredso plus six x squared, all of that overx squared plus three x squaredor x squared plus three x, squared.I should say it that way.Now let's see this numerator I can simplify a little bit.Negative three x squared plus six x squaredthat's going to be positive three x squaredand then we have in orange,we have negative nine x minus an x,well that's gonna be minus ten x, minus ten xand then we have minus 15.So minus 15.So there you have it, we finally have finished.This is all going to be equal tothis is all going to be equal tothree x squared minus ten x minus 15over x squared plus three x, squaredand we are done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-quotient-rule/v/tangent-line-equation-example-1	khanacademy	video	:00We have the curve y is equal to e to the x over 2plus x to the third power.And what we want to do is find the equationof the tangent line to this curve at the point x equals 1.And when x is equal to 1, y is going to be equal to e over 3.It's going to be e over 3.So let's try to figure out the equation of the tangent lineto this curve at this point.And I encourage you to pause this videoand try this on your own first.Well, the slope of the tangent line at this pointis the same thing as the derivative at this point.So let's try to find the derivative of thisor evaluate the derivative of this function right over hereat this point.So to do that, first I'm going to rewrite it.You could use the quotient rule if you like,but I always forget the quotient rule.The product rule is much easier for me to remember.So I can rewrite this as y is equal to-- and I mightas well color code it-- is equal to e to the x times 2 plus xto the third to the negative 1 power.And so the derivative of this, so let me write it here.So y prime is going to be equal to the derivativeof this part of it, e to the x.So the derivative of e to the x is just e to the x.Just let me write that.So we're going to take the derivative of it.And that's what's amazing about e to the x,is that the derivative of e to the xis just e to the x times this thing.So times 2 plus x to the third to the negative 1.And then to that we're going to add this thing.So not its derivative anymore.We're just going to add e to the xtimes the derivative of this thing right over here.So we're going to take the derivative.So we can do the chain rule.It's going to be the derivative of 2plus x to the third to the negative 1power with respect to 2 plus x to the third timesthe derivative of 2 plus x to the third with respect to x.So this is going to be equal to negative-- I'llwrite it this way-- negative 2 plus x to the thirdto the negative 2 power.And then we're going to multiply that times the derivative of 2plus x to the third with respect to x.Well, derivative of this with respect to xis just 3x squared.And of course, we could simplify this a little bit if we like.But the whole point of this is to actually findthe value of the derivative at this point.So let's evaluate.Let's evaluate y prime when x is equal to 1.Y prime of 1 when x is equal to 1.This thing will simplify to-- let's see,this is going to be e times 2 plus 1 to the negative power.So that's just going to be 1/3, right?2 plus 1 to the negative 1.So that's 3 to the negative 1.That's 1/3.So that's times 1/3 plus e to the first power.Now let's see, what does this do?This part right over here, this is2 plus 1 to the negative 2 power.So this-- actually, let me-- I don'twant to-- so this part right over here is going to be,let's see, this is going to be-- Idon't want to make a careless mistake here--is 3 to the negative 2 power.So 3 squared is 9.3 to the negative second power is 1/9.And so it's going to be 1/9.Well, you're going to multiply this negative there.So it's negative 1/9.And then we're going to multiply that times 3 times 1.So it's negative 1/9 times 3.Times 3 right over here.So it's negative 3/9 or negative 1/3.So times negative 1/3.And all I did here is I substituted 1for x and evaluated it.Now this is interesting.I have essentially-- let me rewrite this.This is equal to e over 3 minus e over 3, which is equal to 0.So the slope of the derivative when x is equal to 1 is 0,or the slope of the tangent line is equal to 0.This simplified to a pretty straightforward situation.If I wanted to write a line in slope intercept form,I could write it like this. y is equal to mx plus b, wherem is the slope and b is the y-intercept.Now we know that the slope of the tangent line at this point,it has a slope, is 0.So this is going to be 0.So this whole term is going to be 0.So it's just going to have the form y is equal to b.This is just going to be a horizontal line.So what is a horizontal line thatcontains this point right over here?Well, it contains the value y is equal to e over 3.So this is a horizontal line.It has the same y value the entire time.So if it has the y value e over 3,then we know the equation of the tangent lineto this curve at this point is goingto be y is equal to e over 3.Another way you could think about this right over hereis, well, let's substitute when x is equal to 1.Well, there's not even an x here.But when x is any value, y is equal to e over 3,you get b is equal to e over 3, or you'dget y is equal to e over 3.So it's just a horizontal line.So let's actually visualize this, justto make sure that this actually makes sense.So let me get my graphing calculator out.And so I'm in graphing mode.If you wanted to know how to get there,you literally can just go to graph, y equals,and I will do-- so e to the x power dividedby 2 plus x to the third power.That looks right.And I actually set the range ahead of time to save time.So let me graph this.So let's see.Ooh, it does all sorts of interesting things.All right.Oh, look at that.All right, so now we can trace to get to when x is equal to 1.x equals 1.Right over there, you see y is equal to e over 3,which this is kind of its decimal expansionright over here.And it does look like the slope right over hereis 0, that the tangent line is justgoing to be a horizontal line at that point.So that makes me feel pretty good about our answer.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-quotient-rule/v/normal-line-equation	khanacademy	video	:00So we have the function f of x isequal to e to the x over x squared.And what I want to do in this videois find the equation, not of the tangent line,but the equation of the normal line, when x is equal to 1.So we care about the equation of the normal line.So I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own.And if you need a little bit of a hint, the hint I will giveyou is, is that the slope of a normal lineis going to be the negative reciprocalof the slope of the tangent line.If you imagine a curve like this,and we want to find a tangent line at a point,it's going to look something like this.So the tangent line is going to look like this.A normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line.This is the tangent line.The normal line is going to be perpendicular to that.It's going to go just like that.And if this has a slope of m, then thishas a slope of the negative reciprocal of m.So negative 1/m.So with that as a little bit of a hint,I encourage you to find the equation of the normal lineto this curve, when x equals 1.So let's find the slope of the tangent line.And then we take the negative reciprocal,we can find the slope of the normal line.So to find the slope of the tangent line,we just take the derivative here and evaluate it at x equals 1.So f prime of x, and actually, let merewrite this a little bit.So f of x is equal to e to the x times x to the negative 2.I like to rewrite it this way, because I alwaysforget the whole quotient rule thing.I like the power rule a lot more.And this allows me to use the power rule.I'm sorry, not the power rule, the product rule.So this allows me to do the productrule instead of the quotient rule.So the derivative of this, f primeof x, is going to be the derivative of e to the x.Which is just e to the x times x to the negative 2, pluse to the x times the derivative of x to the negative 2.Which is negative 2x to the negative 3 power.I just used the power rule right over here.So if I want to evaluate when x is equal to 1,this is going to be equal to-- letme do that in that yellow color like.I like switching colors.This is going to be equal to, let's see,this is going to be e to the first power.Which is just e times 1 to the negative 2,which is just 1 plus e to the first power, which is just e,times negative 2.1 to the negative 3 is just 1.So e times negative 2.So let me write it this way.So minus 2e.And e minus 2e is just going to be equal to negative e.So this right over here, this is the slope of the tangent line.And so if we want the slope of the normal,we just take the negative reciprocal.So the negative reciprocal of this is going to be,well the reciprocal is 1 over negative e,but we want the negative of that.So it's going to be 1/e.This is going to be the slope of the normal line.And then if we, and our goal isn't justto the slope of the normal line, wewant the equation of the normal line.And we know the equation of a linecan be represented as y is equal to mxplus b, where m is the slope.So we can say it's going to be y is equal to 1/e-- remember,we're doing the normal line here-- times x plus b.And to solve for b, we just have to recognizethat we know a point that this goes through.This goes through the point x equals 1.And when x equals 1, what is y?Well, y is e to the 1st over 1, which is just e.So this goes to the point 1 comma e.So we know that when x is equal to 1, y is equal to e.And now we can just solve for b.So we get e is equal to 1/e plus b.Or we could just subtract 1 over e from both sides,and we would get b is equal to e minus 1/e.And we could obviously right this as e squared minus 1/eif we want to write it like that.But could just leave it just like this.So the equation of the normal line--so we deserve our drum roll right over here--is going to be y is equal to 1/e times x, plus b.And b, plus b, is all of this.So plus e minus 1/e.So that right there is our equation of the normal line.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/differentiability-implies-continuity	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] What I hope to do in this videois prove that if a function is differentiableat some point, C, that it's alsogoing to be continuous at that point C.But, before we do the proof, let's just remind ourselveswhat differentiability means and what continuity means.So, first, differentiability.DifferentiabilitySo, let's think about that, first.And it's always helpful to draw ourselvesa function.So, that's our Y-axis.This is our X-axis.And let's just draw some function, here.So, let's say my function looks like thisand we care about the point X equals C,which is right over here.So, that's the point X equals C,and then, this value, of course,is going to be F of C.F of C.And one way that we can find the derivativeat X equals C, or the slope of the tangent lineat X equals C is, we could start with some other point.Say, some arbitrary X out here.So, let's say this is some arbitrary X out here.So, then, this point right over there, this value,this Y value, would be F of X.Would be F of X.This graph, of course, is a graph of Y equals F of X.And we can think about finding the slope of this line,this secant line between these two points,but then, we can find the limit as X approaches C.And as X approaches C, this secant,the slope of the secant line is going to approachthe slope of the tangent line, or,it's going to be the derivative.And so, we could take the limit...The limit as X approaches C,as X approaches C,of the slope of this secant line.So, what's the slope?Well, it's gonna be change in Y over change in X.The change in Y is F of X minus F of C,that's our change in Y right over here.This is all review, this is just one definitionof the derivative, or one way to think about the derivative.So, it's going to be F of X minus F of C,that's our change in Y, over our change in X.Over our change in X, which is X minus C.It is X minus,X minus C.So, if this limit exists, then, we're able to findthe slope of the tangent line at this point,and we call that slope of the tangent line,we call that the derivative at X equals C.We say that this is going to be equal to F prime,F prime of C.All of this is review.So, if we're saying, one way to think about it,if we're saying that the function, F,is differentiable at X equals C,we're really just saying that this limitright over here actually exists.And if this limit actually exists,we just call that value F prime of C.So, that's just a review of differentiability.Now, let's give ourselves a review of continuity.Continuity.So, the definition for continuity isif the limit as X approaches C of F of Xis equal to F of C.Now, this might seem a little bit, you know,well, it might pop out to you as being intuitiveor it might seem a little, well, where did this come from,well, let's visualize it and hopefullyit'll make some intuitive sense.So, if you have a function,so, let's actually look at some caseswhere you're not continuous.And that actually might make it a little bit more clear.So, if you had a point discontinuity at X equals C,so, this is X equals C, so, if you hada point discontinuity, so,lemme draw it like this, actually.So, you have a gap, here, and X equals,when X equals C, F of C is actually way up here.So, this is F of C, and then,the function continues like this.The limit, as X approaches C of F of Xis going to be this value, which is clearly differentthan F of C.This value right over here, if you take the limit,if you take the limit as X approaches C of F of X,you're approaching this value.This, right over here, is the limit,as X approaches C of F of X, which is different than F of C.So, it makes it, so, this definition of continuityseems to be good, at least for this case,because this is not a continuous function,you have a point discontinuity.So, for at least in this case, our,this definition of continuity would properlyidentify this as not a continuous function.Now, you could also think about a jump discontinuity.You can also think about a jump discontinuity.So, let's look at this.And all this is, hopefully, a little bit of review.So, a jump discontinuity at C, at X equals C,might look like this.Might look like this.So, this is at X equals C.So, this is X equals C right over here.This would be F of C.But, if you tried to find a value at the limitas X approaches C of F of X,you'd get a different value as you approachC from the negative side, you would approach this value,and as you approach C from the positive side,you would approach F of C, and so, the limit wouldn't exist.So, this limit right over here wouldn't existin the case of jump, of this type of a jump discontinuity.So, once again, this definition would properlysay that this is not, this one right over here,is not continuous, this limit actually would not even exist.And then, you could even look at a,you could look at a function that is truly continuous.If you look at a function that is truly continuous.So, something like this.Something like this.That is X equals C.Well, this is F of C.This is F of C.And if you were to take the limit as X approaches C,as X approaches C from either side of F of X,you're going to approach F of C.So, here, you have the limit as X approaches Cof F of X, indeed, is equal to F of C.So, it's what you would expect for a continuous function.So, now that we've done that reviewof differentiability and continuity,let's prove that differentiabilityactually implies continuity, and I think it's importantto kinda do this review, just so that you canreally visualize things.So, differentiability implies this limitright over here exists.So, let's start with a slightly different limit.Lemme draw a line, here, actually.Lemme draw a line just so we're doing something different.So, let's take, let us take the limitas X approaches C of F of X,of F of X minus F of C.Of F of X minus F of C.Well, can we rewrite this?Well, we could rewrite this as the limit,as X approaches C, and we could essentiallytake this expression and multiplyand divide it by X minus C.So, let's multiply it times X minus C.X minus C, and divide it by X minus C.So, we have F of X minus F of C,all of that over X minus C.So, all I did is I multiplied and I dividedby X minus C.Well, what's this limit going to be equal to?This is going to be equal to,it's going to be the limit, and I'm just applyingthe property of limit, applying a property of limits, here.So, the limit of the product is equal tothe same thing as a product of the limits.So, it's the limit as X approaches C of X minus C,times the limit, lemme write this way,times the limit as X approaches Cof F of X minus F of C,all of that over X minus C.Now, what is this thing right over here?Well, if we assume that F is differentiable at C,and we're going to do that, actually,I should have started off there.Let's assume 'cause we wanted to show the differentiability,it proves continuity.If we assume F differentiable,differentiable at C, well then,this right over here is just going to be F prime of C.This right over here, we just saw it right over here,that's this exact same thing.This is F prime, F prime of C.And what is this thing right over here?The limit as X approaches C of X minus C?Well, that's just gonna be zero.As X approaches C, there's gonna become,approach C minus C, that's just going to be zero.So, what's zero times F prime of C?Well, F prime of C is just going to be some value,so, zero times anything is just going to be zero.So, I did all that work to get a zero.Now, why is this interesting?Well, we just said, we just assumedthat if F is differentiable at C,and we evaluate this limit, we get zero.So, if we assume F is differentiable at C,we can write, we can write the limit,I'm just rewriting it, the limit as X approaches Cof F of X minus F of C, and I could even putparenthesis around it like that,which I already did up here,is equal to zero.Well, this is the same thing,I could use limit properties again,this is the same thing as saying,and I'll do it over, well, actually,lemme do it down here.The limit as X approaches C of F of Xminus the limit as X approaches Cof F of C, of F of C, is equal to zero.The different, the limit of the differenceis the same thing as the difference of the limits.Well, what's this thing over here going to be?Well, F of C is just a number,it's not a function of X anymore,it's just, F of C is going to valuate it to something.So, this is just going to be F of C.This is just going to be F of C.So, the limit of F of X as X approaches C,minus F of C is equal to zero.Well, just add F of C to both sides and what do you get?Well, you get the limit as X approaches Cof F of X is equal to F of C.And this is the definition of continuity.The limit of my function as X approaches Cis equal to the function, is equal to the valueof the function at C.This is, this means that our function is continuous.Continuous at C.So, just a reminder, we started assumingF differentiable at C, we use that factto evaluate this limit right over here,which, we got to be equal to zero,and if that limit is equal to zero,then, it just follows, just doing a little bit of algebraand using properties of limits,that the limit as X approaches C of F of Xis equal to F of C, and that's our definitionof being continuous.Continuous at the point C.So, hopefully, that satisfies you.If we know that the derivative exists at a point,if it's differentiable at a point C,that means it's also continuous at that point C.The function is also continuous at that point.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/is-the-power-rule-reasonable	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video isto see whether the power rule is giving usresults that at least seem reasonable.This is by no means a proof of the power rule,but at least we'll feel a little bit more comfortable using it.So let's say that f of x is equal to x.The power rule tells us that f primeof x is going to be equal to what?Well, x is the same thing as x to the first power.So n is implicitly 1 right over here.So we bring the 1 out front.It'll be 1 times x to the 1 minus 1 power.So it's going to be 1 times x to the 0 power. x to the 0is just 1.So it's just going to be equal to 1.Now, does that makes conceptual senseif we actually try to visualize these functions?So let me actually try to graph these functions.So that's my y-axis.This is my x-axis.And let me graph y equals x.So y is equal to f of x here.So y is equal to x.So it looks something like that.So y is equal to x.Or this is f of x is equal to x, or yis equal to this f of x right over there.Now, actually, let me just call that f of x justto not confuse you.So this right over here is f of xis equal to x that I graphed right over here.y is equal to f of x, which is equal to x.And now, let me graph the derivative.Let me graph f prime of x.That's saying it's 1.That's saying it's 1 for all x.Regardless of what x is, it's going to be equal to 1.Is this consistent with what we knowabout derivatives and slopes and all the rest?Well, let's look at our function.What is the slope of the tangent line right at this point?Well, right over here, this has slope 1 continuously.Or it has a constant slope of 1.Slope is equal to 1 no matter what x is.It's a line.And for a line, the slope is constant.So over here, the slope is indeed 1.If you go to this point over here, the slope is indeed 1.If you go over here, the slope is indeed 1.So we've got a pretty valid response there.Now, let's try something where the slope might change.So let's say I have g of x is equal to x squared.The power rule tells us that g prime of xwould be equal to what?Well, n is equal to 2.So it's going to be 2 times x to the 2 minus 1.Or it's going to be equal to 2 x to the first power.It's going to be equal to 2x.So let's see if this makes a reasonable sense.And I'm going to try to graph this one a little bit moreprecisely.Let's see how precisely I can graph it.So this is the x-axis, y-axis.Let me mark some stuff off here.So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.This is 1, 2, 3, 4.1, 2, 3, 4.So g of x.When x is 0, it's 0.When x is 1, it is 1.When x is negative 1, it's 1.When x is 2, it is 4.So that puts us right over there-- 1, 2, 3, 4.Puts us right over there.When x is negative 2, you get to 4.It's a parabola.You've seen this for many years.I put that point a little bit too high.It looks something like this.Actually, the last two points I graphed are a little bit weird.So this might be right over here.So it looks something like this.It looks something like that.And then, when you come over here,it looks something like that.It's symmetric.So I'm trying my best to draw it reasonably.So there you go.That's the graph of g of x. g of x is equal to x squared.Now, let's graph g prime of x or what the power rule istelling us a g prime of x is.So g prime of x is equal to 2x.So that's just a line that goes through the origin of slope 2.So it looks something like that.When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2.When x is equal to 2, y or g of x is equal to 4.So it looks something like this.Let me try my best to draw a straight line.It looks something like this.Now, does this make sense?Well, if you just eyeball it really fast,if you look at this point right over here--and you want to think about the slope of the tangent line.Let me do this in a color that pops out a little bit more.So the tangent line would look something like this.So it looks like it has a reasonably high negative slope.Yeah.It's definitely a negative slope,and it's a pretty steep negative slope.For x is equal to negative 2, g prime of negative 2is equal to 2 times negative 2, which is equal to negative 4.So this is claiming that the slope at this point-- sothis right over here is negative 4--is saying that the slope of this pointis negative 4. m is equal to negative 4.That looks about right.It's a fairly steep negative slope.Now, what happens if you go right over herewhen x is equal to 0?Well, our derivative-- if you say g prime of 0--is telling us that the slope of our original function, g, at xis equal to 0 is 2 times 0 is 0.Well, does that make sense?Well, if we go to our original parabola,it does indeed make sense.That's the slope of the tangent line.The tangent line looks something like this.We're at a minimum point.We're at the vertex.The slope really does look to be 0.And what if you go right over hereto x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line?Well, over here, the tangent line looks something like this.It looks like a fairly steep positive slope.What is our derivative telling us based on the power rule?So this is essentially saying, hey,tell me what the slope of the tangent line for gis when x is equal to 2.Well, we figured it out.It's going to be 2 times x.It's going to be 2 times 2, which is equal to 4.It's telling us that the slope over here is 4.And I'm just using m. m is often the letterused to denote slope.They're saying that the slope of the tangent linethere is 4, which seems completely, completelyreasonable.So I encourage you to try this out yourself.I encourage you to try to estimate the slopesby calculating, by taking points closerand closer around those points.And you'll see that the power rule reallydoes give you results that actually make sense.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/proof-d-dx-x-n	khanacademy	video	:00I just did several videos on the binomial theorem, so Ithink, now that they're done, I think now is good time to dothe proof of the derivative of the general form.Let's take the derivative of x to the n.Now that we know the binomial theorem, wehave the tools to do it.How do we take the derivative?Well, what's the classic definition of the derivative?It is the limit as delta x approaches zero of f ofx plus delta x, right?So f of x plus delta x in this situation is x plus deltax to the nth power, right?Minus f of x, well f of x here is just x to the n.All of that over delta x.Now that we know the binomial theorem we can figure outwhat the expansion of x plus delta x is to the nth power.And if you don't know the binomial theorem, go to mypre-calculus play list and watch the videos onthe binomial theorem.The binomial theorem tells us that this is equal to-- I'mgoing to need some space for this one-- the limit asdelta x approaches zero.And what's the binomial theorem?This is going to be equal to-- I'm just going to do thenumerator-- x to the n plus n choose 1.Once again, review the binomial theorem if this is looks likelatin to you and you don't know latin.n choose 1 of x to the n minus 1 delta x plus n choose 2 x tothe n minus 2, that's x n minus 2, delta x squared.Then plus, and we have a bunch of the digits, and in thisproof we don't have to go through all the digits but thebinomial theorem tells us what they are and, of course, thelast digit we just keep adding is going to be 1-- it wouldbe n choose n which is 1.Let me just write that down. n choose n.It's going to be x to the zero times delta x to the n.So that's the binomial expansion.Let me switch back to minus, green that's x plus delta xto the n, so minus x to the n power.That's x to the n, I know I squashed it there.All of that over delta x.Let's see if we can simplify.First of all we have an x to the n here, and at the very endwe subtract out an x to the n, so these two cancel out.If we look at every term here, every term in the numerator hasa delta x, so we can divide the numerator and thedenominator by delta x.This is the same thing as 1 over delta x timesthis whole thing.So that is equal to the limit as delta x approaches zero of,so we divide the top and the bottom by delta x, or wemultiply the numerator times 1 over delta x.We get n choose 1 x to the n minus 1.What's delta x divided by delta x, that's just 1.Plus n choose 2, x to the n minus 2.This is delta x squared, but we divide by delta x wejust get a delta x here.Delta x.And then we keep having a bunch of terms, we're going to divideall of them by delta x.And then the last term is delta x to the n, but thenwe're going to divide that by delta x.So the last term becomes n choose n, x to the zero is 1,we can ignore that. delta x to the n divided by delta x.Well that's delta x to the n minus 1.Then what are we doing now?Remember, we're taking the limit as deltax approaches zero.As delta x approaches zero, pretty much every term thathas a delta x in it, it becomes zero.When you multiply but zero, you get zero.This first term has no delta x in it, butevery other term does.Every other term, even after we divided by delta xhas a delta x in it.So that's a zero.Every term is zero, all of the other n minus 1terms, they're all zeros.All we're left with is that this is equal to n choose1 of x the n minus 1.And what's n choose 1?That equals n factorial over 1 factorial divided by n minus 1factorial times x to the n minus 1.1 factorial is 1.If I have 7 factorial divided by 6 factorial, that's just 1.Or if I have 3 factorial divided by 2 factorial, that'sjust 3, you can work it out.10 factorial divided by 9 factorial that's 10.So n factorial divided by n minus 1 factorial,that's just equal to n.So this is equal to n times x to the n minus 1.That's the derivative of x to the n. n timesx to the n minus 1.We just proved the derivative for any positive integer whenx to the power n, where n is any positive integer.And we see later it actually works for all realnumbers and the exponent.I will see you in a future video.Another thing I wanted to point out is, you know I said thatwe had to know the binomial theorem.But if you think about it, we really didn't even have to knowthe binomial theorem because we knew in any binomialexpansion-- I mean, you'd have to know a little bit-- but ifyou did a little experimentation you wouldrealize that whenever you expand a plus b to the nthpower, first term is going to be a to the n, and the secondterm is going to be plus n a to the n minus 1 b.And then you are going to keep having a bunch of terms.But these are the only terms that are relevant to this proofbecause all the other terms get canceled out when deltax approaches zero.So if you just knew that you could have done this, but it'smuch better to do it with the binomial theorem.Ignore what I just said if it confused you.I'm just saying that we could have just said the rest ofthese terms all go to zero.Anyway, hopefully you found that fulfilling.I will see you in future videos.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/proof-d-dx-sqrt-x	khanacademy	video	:00So I've been requested to do the proof of the derivative ofthe square root of x, so I thought I would do a quickvideo on the proof of the derivative of thesquare root of x.So we know from the definition of a derivative that thederivative of the function square root of x, that is equalto-- let me switch colors, just for a variety-- that's equal tothe limit as delta x approaches 0.And you know, some people say h approaches 0,or d approaches 0.I just use delta x.So the change in x over 0.And then we say f of x plus delta x, so in thiscase this is f of x.So it's the square root of x plus delta x minus f of x,which in this case it's square root of x.All of that over the change in x, over delta x.Right now when I look at that, there's not much simplificationI can do to make this come out with something meaningful.I'm going to multiply the numerator and the denominatorby the conjugate of the numerator is whatI mean by that.Let me rewrite it.Limit is delta x approaching 0-- I'm just rewritingwhat I have here.So I said the square root of x plus delta x minussquare root of x.All of that over delta x.And I'm going to multiply that-- after switching colors--times square root of x plus delta x plus the square root ofx, over the square root of x plus delta x plus thesquare root of x.This is just 1, so I could of course multiply that times-- ifwe assume that x and delta x aren't both 0, this is adefined number and this will be 1.And we can do that.This is 1/1, we're just multiplying it times thisequation, and we get limit as delta x approaches 0.This is a minus b times a plus b.Let me do little aside here.Let me say a plus b times a minus b is equal to asquared minus b squared.So this is a plus b times a minus b.So it's going to be equal to a squared.So what's this quantity squared or this quantity squared,either one, these are my a's.Well it's just going to be x plus delta x.So we get x plus delta x.And then what's b squared?So minus square root of x is b in this analogy.So square root of x squared is just x.And all of that over delta x times square root of xplus delta x plus the square root of x.Let's see what simplification we can do.Well we have an x and then a minus x, so thosecancel out. x minus x.And then we're left in the numerator and the denominator,all we have is a delta x here and a delta x here, so let'sdivide the numerator and the denominator by delta x.So this goes to 1, this goes to 1.And so this equals the limit-- I'll write smaller, because I'mrunning out of space-- limit as delta x approaches 0 of 1 over.And of course we can only do this assuming that delta--well, we're dividing by delta x to begin with, so we knowit's not 0, it's just approaching zero.So we get square root of x plus delta x plusthe square root of x.And now we can just directly take the limitas it approaches 0.We can just set delta x as equal to 0.That's what it's approaching.So then that equals one over the square root of x.Right, delta x is 0, so we can ignore that.We could take the limit all the way to 0.And then this is of course just a square root of x here plusthe square root of x, and that equals 1 over2 square root of x.And that equals 1/2x to the negative 1/2.So we just proved that x to the 1/2 power, the derivative of itis 1/2x to the negative 1/2, and so it is consistent withthe general property that the derivative of-- oh I don'tknow-- the derivative of x to the n is equal to nx to the nminus 1, even in this case where the n was 1/2.Well hopefully that's satisfying.I didn't prove it for all fractions but this is a start.This is a common one you see, square root of x, andit's hopefully not too complicated for proof.I will see you in future videos.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/sinx-over-x-as-x-approaches-0	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois prove that the limitas theta approaches zeroof sine of thetaover theta is equal to one.So let's start with a little bit of a geometricor trigonometric construction that I have here.So this white circle, this is a unit circle,that we'll label it as such.So it has radius one,unitcircle.So what does the lengthof this salmon-colored line represent?Well, the height of this line would be the y-coordinateof where this radius intersects the unit circle.And so by definition, by the unit circle definitionof trig functions, the length of this lineis going to be sine of theta.If we wanted to make sure that also worked for thetasthat end up in the fourth quadrant, which will be useful,we can just insure that it's the absolute valueof the sine of theta.Now what about this blue line over here?Can I express that in terms of a trigonometric function?Well, let's think about it.What would tangent of theta be?Let me write it over here.Tangent of thetais equal to opposite over adjacent.So if we look at this broader triangle right over here,this is our angle theta in radians.This is the opposite side.The adjacent side down here, this just has length one.Remember, this is a unit circle.So this just has length one,so the tangent of theta is the opposite side.The opposite side is equal to the tangent of theta.And just like before, this is going to be a positive valuefor sitting here in the first quadrantbut I want things to workin both the first and the fourth quadrantfor the sake of our proof,so I'm just gonna put an absolute value here.So now that we've done,I'm gonna think about some trianglesand their respective areas.So first, I'm gonna draw a trianglethat sits in this wedge, in this pie piece,this pie slice within the circle,so I can construct this triangle.And so let's think about the areaof what I am shading in right over here.How can I express that area?Well, it's a triangle.We know that the area of a triangleis 1/2 base times height.We know the heightis the absolute value of the sine of thetaand we know that the base is equal to one,so the area here is going to be equal to 1/2times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of the sine of theta.I'll rewrite it over here.I can just rewrite thatas the absolute value of the sine of theta over two.Now let's think about the area of this wedgethat I am highlighting in this yellow color.So what fraction of the entire circle is this going to be?If I were to go all the way around the circle,it would be two pi radians,so this is theta over to two pis of the entire circleand we know the area of the circle.This is a unit circle, it has a radius one,so it'd be times the area of the circle,which would be pi times the radius square,the radius is one, so it's just gonna be times pi.And so the area of this wedge right over here,theta over two.And if we wanted to make this workfor thetas in the fourth quadrant,we could just write an absolute value sign right over there'cause we're talking about positive area.And now let's think about this larger trianglein this blue color, and this is pretty straightforward.The area here is gonna be 1/2 times base times height.So the area, and once again, this is this entire are,that's going to be 1/2 times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of tangent of theta.And so I can just write that downas the absolute value of the tangent of theta over two.Now, how would you compare the areasof this pink or this salmon-colored trianglewhich sits inside of this wedgeand how do you compare that area of the wedgeto the bigger triangle?Well, it's clear that the area of the salmon triangleis less than or equal to the area of the wedgeand the area of the wedge is less than or equal tothe area of the big, blue triangle.The wedge includes the salmon triangleplus this area right over here,and then the blue triangle includes the wedgeplus it has this area right over here.So I think we can feel good visuallythat this statement right over here is trueand I'm just gonna doa little bit of algebraic manipulation.Let me multiply everything by twoso I can rewrite that the absolute valueof sine of theta is less than or equal tothe absolute value of thetawhich is less than or equal to the absolute valueof tangent of theta, and let's see.Actually, instead of writing the absolute valueof tangent of theta, I'm gonna rewrite thatas the absolute value of sine of thetaover the absolute value of cosine of theta.That's gonna be the same thingas the absolute value of tangent of theta.And the reason why I did thatis we can now divide everythingby the absolute value of sine of theta.Since we're dividing by a positive quantity,it's not going to change the direction of the inequalities.So let's do thatI'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of sine of theta.I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of thetaand then I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of theta.And what do I get?Well, over here, I get a oneand on the right-hand side, I get a oneover the absolute value of cosine theta.These two cancel out.So the next step I'm gonna dois take the reciprocal of everything.And so when I take the reciprocal of everything,that actually will switch the inequalities.The reciprocal of one is still going to be onebut now, since I'm taking the reciprocal of this here,it's gonna be greater than or equal tothe absolute value of the sine of thetaover the absolute value of theta,and that's going to be greater than or equal tothe reciprocal of oneover the absolute value of cosine of thetais the absolute value of cosine of theta.We really just care about the first and fourth quadrants.You can think about this thetaapproaching zero from that directionor from that direction there,so that would be the first and fourth quadrants.So if we're in the first quadrant and theta is positive,sine of theta is gonna be positive as well.And if we're in the fourth quadrant and theta's negative,well, sine of theta is gonna have the same sign.It's going to be negative as well.And so these absolute value signs aren't necessary.In the first quadrant,sine of theta and theta are both positive.In the fourth quadrant, they're both negative,but when you divide them,you're going to get a positive value, so I can erase those.If we're in the first or fourth quadrant,our X value is not negative,and so cosine of theta, which is the x-coordinateon our unit circle, is not going to be negative,and so we don't need the absolute value signs over there.Now, we should pause a secondbecause we're actually almost done.We have just set up three functions.You could think of this as f of x is equal to,you could view this as f of theta is equal to one,g of theta is equal to this,and h of theta is equal to that.And over the interval that we care about,we could say for negative pi over twois less than theta is less than pi over two,but over this interval, this is true for any thetaover which these functions are defined.Sine of theta over theta is defined over this interval,except where theta is equal to zero.But since we're defined everywhere else,we can now find the limit.So what we can say is, well, by the squeeze theoremor by the sandwich theorem,if this is true over the interval,then we also know that the following is true.And this, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.The limitas theta approaches zero of thisis going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this,which is the one that we care about,sine of theta over theta,which is going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this.Now this is clearly going to be just equal to one.This is what we care about.And this, what's the limit as theta approaches zeroof cosine of theta?Well, cosine of zero is just oneand it's a continuous function,so this is just gonna be one.So let's see.This limit is going to be less than or equal to oneand it's gonna be greater than or equal to one,so this must be equal to oneand we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/1-cosx-over-x-as-x-approaches-0	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we wanna do in this videois figure out what the limit, as x approaches zero,of one minus cosine of x over x is equal to.And we're going to assume we know one thing ahead of time.We're going to assume we know that the limit,as x approaches zero, of sine of x over x,that this is equal to one.Now, I'm not gonna reprove this in this video,but we have a whole other videodedicated to proving this famous limit,and we do it using the squeeze, or the sandwich theorem.So, let's see if we can work this out.So the first thing we're going to dois algebraically manipulate this expression.What I'm going to do is I'm going to multiplyboth the numerator and the denominatorby one plus cosine of x.So, times...The denominator I have to do the same thing,one plus cosine of x.I'm not changing the value of the expression,this is just multiplying it by one.What does that do for us?Well I can rewrite the whole thing asthe limit, as x approaches zero,so one minus cosine of x times one plus cosine of x,well that is just going to be...Put this in another color.That is going to be one squared, which is just one,minus cosine squared of x.Cosine squared of x, difference of squares.And then in the denominator, I am going to havethese, which is just x times 1 plus cosine of x.Now what is one minus cosine squared of x?Well, this comes straight out of thePythagorean identity, trig identity.This is the same thing as the sine squared of x.So, sine squared of x.And so, I can rewrite all of this as being equal tothe limit, as x approaches zero,and let me rewrite this as...Instead of sine squared of x,that's the same thing as sine of x times sine of x.Let me write it that way.Sine x times sine x.So, I'll take the first sine of x,so I'll take this one right over here,and put it over this x.So, sine of x over xtimes the second sine of x, this one,over one plus cosine of xtimes sine of x over one plus cosine of x.All I've done is I've leveraged a trigonometric identity,and I've done a little bit of algebraic manipulation.Well here, the limit of the productof these two expressions, is going to be the same thingas the product of the limits.So I can rewrite this as being equal tothe limit, as x approaches zero, of sine of x over xtimes the limit, as x approaches zero,of sine of x over one plus cosine of x.Now, we said, going into this video,that we're going to assume that we know what this is.We've proven it in other videos.What is the limit, as x approaches zero,of sine of x over x?Well, that is equal to one.So, this whole limit is just going to be dependenton whatever this is equal to.Well, this is pretty straight forward, here.As x approaches zero, the numerator's approaching zero,sine of zero is zero.The denominator is approaching...Cosine of zero is one,so the denominator is approaching two.So this is approaching zero over two, or just zero.That's approaching zero.One times zero, well this is just going to be equal to zero.And we're done.Using that fact, and a little bit of trig identities,and a little bit of algebraic manipulation,we were able to show that our original limit,the limit, as x approaches zero,of one minus cosine of x over x is equal to zero.And I encourage you to graph it.You will see that that makes sensefrom a graphical point of view, as well.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/derivative-of-sin-x	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we have written here are twoof the most useful derivatives to know in calculus.If you know that the derivative of sine of xwith respect to x is cosine of xand the derivative of cosine of xwith respect to x is negative sine of x,that can empower you to do many more,far more complicated derivatives.But what we're going to do in this videois dig a little bit deeperand actually prove this first derivative.I'm not gonna prove the second one.You can actually use it,using the information we're going to do in this one,but it's just to make you feel good thatsomeone's just not making this up,that there is a little bit of mathematicalrigor behind it all.So let's try to calculate it.So the derivative with respect to x of sine of x,by definition, this is going to be the limitas delta x approaches zeroof sineof x plusdelta x minussine of x,all of that over delta,all of that over delta x.This is really just the slope of the line between the pointx comma sine of x and x plus delta xcomma sine of x plus delta x.So how can we evaluate this?Well, we can rewrite sine of x plus delta xusing our angle addition formulasthat we learned during our trig identities.So this is going to be the same thingas the limitas delta x approaches zero.I'll write, rewrite this using our trig identity as cosine,as cosineof xtimes sineof delta xplus sineof xtimes cosineof delta x.And then we're going to subtract this sine of x up hereminus sine of x,all of that over,let me see if I can draw a relatively straight line,all of that overdelta x.So this can be rewritten as being equal to the limitas delta x approaches zero of,let me write this part in red,so that would be cosine of x, sineof delta x,all of that over delta x.And then that's going to be plus,I'll do all of this in orange,all I'm doing isI have the sum of things up here divided by delta x,I'm just breaking it up a little bit, plus sineof x,cosine of delta xminus sine of x,all of that over delta x.And remember, I'm taking the limitof this entire expression.Well, the limit of a sum is equal to the sum of the limits.So this is going to be equal to,I'll do this first part in red,the limitas delta x approaches zero of,let's see I can rewrite this as cosine of xtimes sineof delta xover delta xplusthe limitas delta x approaches zeroof, and let's see I can factor out a sine of x here.So it's timessineof x.I factor that out,and I'll be left with a cosineof delta x minus one,all of that overdelta x.So that's this limit.And let's see if I can simplify this even more.Let me scroll down a bit.So this left-hand expression I can rewrite.This cosine of x has nothing to do withthe limit as delta x approaches zero,so we can actually take that outside of the limit.So we have the cosine of x times the limitas delta x approaches zeroof sine of delta xover delta x.And now we need to add this thing,and let's see how I could write this.So I have a sine of x here.But actually, let me rewrite this a little bit differently.Cosine of delta x minus one,that's the same thing as one minus cosine of delta xtimes negative one.And so you have a sine of x times a negative one.And since the delta x has nothing to do with the sine of x,let me take that out, the negative and the sine of x.So we have minus sine of xtimes the limitas delta x approaches zero of,what we have left over is one minus cosine of delta xoverdelta x.Now, I'm not gonna do it in this video.In other videos, we will actually do the proof.But in other videos we have shown,using the squeeze theorem,or sometimes known as the sandwich theorem,that the limit is delta x approaches zeroof sine of delta x over delta x,that this is equal to one.And we also show in another video,and that's based on the ideathat this limit is equal to one,that this limit right over here is equal to zero.And so what we are then left with,and I encourage you to watch the videosthat prove this and this,although these are really useful limitsto know in general in calculus,that what you're gonna be left with is just cosine of xtimes one minus sine of x times zero.Well, all of this is just gonna go away,and you're gonna have,that is going to be equal to cosine of x.And you are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/derivative-of-cos-x	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What I wanna do in this videois make a visual argument as to why the derivative withrespect to x of cosine of x is equal to negative sine of x.And we're gonna base this argument,based on a previous proof we madethat the derivative with respect to x of sine of xis equal to cosine of x.So we're gonna assume this over here.I encourage you to watch that video.That's actually a fairly involved proof that proves this,but if we assume this, I'm gonna make a visual argumentthat this right over here is the derivativewith respect to x of cosine of x is negative sine of x.So right over here we seen sine of x in redand we see cosine of x in blue.And we're assuming that this blue graphis showing the derivative, the slope of the tangent linefor any x value of the red graph.And we've got an intuition for that in previous videos.Now what I'm gonna do next,is I'm gonna shift both of these graphsto the left by pi over two.Shift it to the left by pi over twoand I'm also gonna shift the blue graph to the leftby pi over two.And so what am I going to get?Well the blue graph is gonna look like this oneright over here and if it was cosine of x up here,we can now say that this is equal toy is equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.This is the blue graph,cosine of x, shifted to the left by pi over two.And this is y is equal to sine of x plus pi over two.Now the visual argument is, all I did,is I shifted both of these graphsto the left by pi over two.So it should still be the case that the derivativeof the red graph is the blue graph.So we should still be able to saythat the derivative with respect to x of the red graph,sin of x plus pi over twothat that is equal to the blue graph.That that is equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.Now what is sin of x plus pi over two?Well that's the same thing as cosine of x.You can see this red graph is the same thing as cosine of x.We know that from our trig identitiesand you can also see in intuitively or graphicallyjust by looking at these graphs.Now what is cosine of x plus pi over two?Well once again, from our trig identities,we know that that is the exact same thingas negative sine of x.So there you have it, the visual argument.Just start with this knowledge,shift both of these graphs to the left by pi over two,it should still be true,that the derivative with respect to xof sine of x plus pi over twois equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.And this is the same thing as saying what we haveright over here.So now we should feel pretty good.We proved this in a previous videoand we have a very strong visual argument for thisfor cosine of x in this video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-chain-rule/v/chain-rule-introduction	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to go overin this video is one of the core principles in calculus,and you're going to use it any time you take the derivative,anything even reasonably complex.And it's called the chain rule.And when you're first exposed to it,it can seem a little daunting and a little bit convoluted.But as you see more and more examples,it'll start to make sense, and hopefully it'd even startto seem a little bit simple and intuitive over time.So let's say that I had a function.Let's say I have a function h of x, and it is equal to,just for example, let's say it's equal to sine of x,let's say it's equal to sine of x squared.Now, I could've written that,I could've written it like this,sine squared of x, but it'll be a little bit clearerusing that type of notation.So let me make it so I have h of x.And what I'm curious about is what is h prime of x?So I want to know h prime of x,which another way of writing it isthe derivative of h with respect to x.These are just different notations.And to do this, I'm going to use the chain rule.I'm going to use the chain rule,and the chain rule comes into play every time,any time your function can be used as a compositionof more than one function.And as that might not seem obvious right now,but it will hopefully,maybe by the end of this video or the next one.Now, what I want to dois a little bit of a thought experiment,a little bit of a thought experiment.If I were to ask youwhat is the derivative with respect to x,if I were to just apply the derivative operatorto x squared with respect to x, what do I get?Well, this gives me two x.We've seen that many, many, many, many times.Now, what if I were to take the derivative with respect to aof a squared?Well, it's the exact same thing.I just swapped an a for the x's.This is still going to be equal to two a.Now I will do somethingthat might be a little bit more bizarre.What if I were to take the derivative with respect tosine of x,with respect to sine of x of,of sine of x,sine of x squared?Well, wherever I had the x's up here, the a's over here,I just replace it with a sine of x.So this is just going to be two times the thing that I had,so whatever I'm taking the derivative with respect to.Here it was with respect to x.Here with respect to a.Here's with respect to sine of x.So it's going to be two timessine of x.Now, so the chain rule tells usthat this derivative is going to be the derivativeof our whole function with respect,or the derivative of this outer function, x squared,the derivative of x squared,the derivative of this outer functionwith respect to sine of x.So that's going to be two sine of x,twosine of x.So we could view it as the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner, two sine of x.We could just treat sine of x like it's kind of an x.And it would've been just two x,but instead it's a sine of x.We say two sine of x times,times the derivative, do this is green,times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x.Times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x,well, that's more straightforward,a little bit more intuitive.The derivative of sine of xwith respect to x, we've seen multiple times,is cosine of x,so times cosine of x.And so there we've applied the chain rule.It was the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner.So derivative of sine of x squaredwith respect to sine of x is two sine of x,and then we multiply that times the derivative of sine of xwith respect to x.So let me make it clear.This right over here is the derivative.We're taking the derivative of,we're taking the derivative of sine of x squared.So let me make it clear.That's what we were taking the derivative ofwith respect to sine of x,with respect to sine of x.And then we're multiplying that timesthe derivative of sine of x,the derivative of sineof xwith respect to,with respect to x.And this is where it might start makinga little bit of intuition.You can't really treat these differentials,this d whatever, this dx, this d sine of x,as a number.And you really can't,this notation makes it look like a fractionbecause intuitively that's what we're doing.But if you were to treat 'em like fractions,then you could think about canceling that and that.And once again, this isn't a rigorous thing to do,but it can help with the intuition.And then what you're left with is the derivativeof this whole sine of x squared with respect to x.So you're left with,you're left with the derivative ofessentially our original function, sine of x squaredwith respect to x,with respect to x, which is exactly what dh/dx is.This right over here,this right over here is our original function h.That's our original function h.So it might seem a little bit daunting now.What I'll do in the next video is another several examples,and then we'll try to abstract this a little bit.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-chain-rule/v/common-chain-rule-misunderstandings	khanacademy	video	:00What we're gonna do in this videois focus on key misunderstandings that folks often have,and we actually got these misunderstandingsfrom the folks who write the AP exams,from the actual College Board.So let's say that we are trying to takethe derivative of the expression.So let's say we're taking the derivativeof the expression,the natural log of sine of x.So the first key misconception or misunderstandingthat many people haveis when you're dealingwith transcendental functions like this,and transcendental functions is just a fancy wordfor these functions like trigonometric functions,logarithmic functions,that don't use standard algebraic operations.But when you see transcendental functions like thisor compositions of them,many people confuse this with the product of functions.So at first when they look at this,they might see this as being the sameas the derivative with respect to xof natural log of x,natural log of x, times sine of x.And you can see just the way that it's written,they look very similar,but this is the product of two functions.If you said natural log of x is f of x,and sine of x is g of x,this is the product of sine and g of x,sorry this is the product of f of x and g of x,and here you would use the product rule.So to actually compute this,you would use the product, the product rule.But this is a composition.Here you have f of g of x,not f of x times g of x.So here you havethat is our g of x, it equals sine of x,and then our f of g of xis the natural log of sine of x.So this is f of g of x,f of g of x just like that.If someone asks you just what f of x was,well that would be natural log of x,but f of g of x is natural log of our g of x,which is natural log of sine of x.So that's the key first thing,always make sure whether you're gonna use,especially with these transcendental functions,that hey if this is a composition you've gotta usethe chain rule, not the product rule.It's not the product.Now sometimes you have a combination,you have a product of compositions,and then things get a little bit more involved.But pay close attention to make surethat you're not dealing with a composition.Now the next misconception students haveis even if they recognize,okay I've gotta use the chain rule,sometimes it doesn't go fully to completion.So let's continue using this example.The chain rule here says,look we have to take the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner function.So if I were to say,in this case, f of x is natural log of x,f of g of x is this expression here.So if I wanna do this first part,f prime of g of x,f prime of g of x,well the derivative of the natural log of xis one over x.So the natural log, derivative of natural log of xis one over x,but we don't want the derivative where the input is x.We want the derivative when the input is g of x.So instead of it being one over x,it's gonna be one over g of x.One over g of x,and we know that g of x is equal to sine of x.That's equal to sine of x.Now one key misunderstanding that the folksof the College Board told us aboutis many students stop right there.They just do this first part,and then they forget to multiply this second part.So here we are not done.We need to take this and multiply it times g prime of x.And let me write this down.g prime of x, what would that be?Well the derivative of sine of x with respect to x,well that's just going to be cosine of x,cosine of x.So in this example right over here,the derivative is going to be,let's see if I can squeeze it in over here,it's going to be one over sine of x which is this part,times cosine of x.So let me write it down.It is going to be one over sine of x,we'll do that in that other color,one over sine of x,and then times cosine of x.So once again,just to make sure that you don't fall intoone of these misconceptions.Let me box this off so it's a little bit,it's a little bit cleaner.So to just make sure that you don't fallinto one of these misconceptions here,recognize the composition,that this is not the product of natural log of xand sine of x.It's natural log of sine of x.And then when you're actually applying the chain rule,derivative of the outside with respect to the inside,so the derivative of natural log of x is one over x,so that applied when the input is g of xis one over sine of x.And then multiply that times the derivativeof the inner function.So don't forget to do this right over here.Now another misconception that students have,is instead of doing what we just did,instead of applying the chain rule like this,they take the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the derivative of the inner function.So for example,they would compute this,f prime of g prime of x,f prime of g prime of x.Which in this case, f prime of x is one over x,but if the input is g prime of x,g prime of x is cosine of x.So many students end up doing thiswhere they take the derivative of the outside,and they apply the input into that,they use the derivative of the inside function.This is not right.Be very careful that you're not doing that.You do the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside function,not taking it's derivative,and then multiply, don't forget to multiply,times the derivative of the inside function here.So hopefully that helps a little bit.If all of this looks completely foreign to you,I encourage you to watch the whole seriesof chain rule introductory videosand worked examples we have.This is just a topping on top of thatto make sure that you don't fall into these misconceptionsof applying the product rulewhen you really need to be applying the chain ruleor forgetting to do part of the chain rule,multiplying by g prime of x,or evaluating f prime of g prime of x.So hopefully that helps.

we're running out of variables,although there are a lot of letters left.So if I say h of x is just equal to the cosineof whatever I input, so it's equal to the cosine of x,well then h of w of u of xis gonna be g of x.Let me write that down.H of w of u of x,u of x, is going to be equal to,remember, h of x takes the cosineof whatever its input is,so it's gonna take the cosine.Now its input is w of u of x.We already figured out w of u of xis going to be this business.So it's going to be sine of x plus one,where the u of x is sine of x,but then we input that into w,so we got sine of x plus one,and then we inputed that into hto get cosine of that,which is our original expression,which is equal to g of x.So the whole point here is to appreciatehow to recognize compositions of functions.Now I wanna stress, it's not alwaysgoing to be a composition of a function.For example, if I have some function,let me just clear this out,if I had some function f of xis equal to cosine of x times sine of x,it would be hard to express this asa composition of functions,but I can represent it as the product of functions.For example, I could say cosine of x,I could say u of x is equal to cosine of x.And I could say v of x, it's a different color,I could say v of xis equal to sine of x.And so here, f of x wouldn't be the compositionof u and v, it would be the product.F of x is equal to u of xtimes v of x.If we were take the composition,if we were to say u of v of x,pause the video, think about what that is,and that's a little bit of review.Well this is going to be, I take u of xtakes the cosine of whatever is input,and now the input is v of x, which would be sine of x;sine of x.And then if you did v of u of x,well that'd be the other way around.It would be sine of cosine of x.But anyway, this is once again, just tohelp us recognize, hey, do I have,when I look at an expression or a function definition,am I looking at products of functions,am I looking at compositions of functions?Sometimes you're looking at products of compositionsor quotients of compositions,all sorts of different combinations of howyou can put functions together to create new functions.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-chain-rule/v/differentiating-composite-functions-1	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's say we have the function f of xwhich is equal to cosine of x to the third powerwhich we could also write like this,cosine of x to the third power.And we are interested in figuring outwhat f prime of x is going to be equal to.So we want to figure out f prime of x and as we will see,the chain rule is going to be very useful hereand what I'm going to do isI'm going to first just apply the chain ruleand then maybe dig into it a little bitto make sure we draw the connectionbetween what we're doing here and then what you might seein maybe some of your Calculus textbooksthat explain the chain rule.So if we have a functionthat is defined as essentially a composite function,notice this expression right here,we are taking something to the third power.It isn't just an x that we're taking to the third power.We are taking a cosine of x to the third power.So we're taking a function, you could view it this way,we're taking the function cosine of xand then we're inputting it in to another functionthat takes it to the third power.So let me put it this way.If you viewed,if you say, look, we could take an x,we put it into one function and that is,that first function is cosine of xso first, we evaluate the cosineand so that's going to produce cosine of x,cosine of x,and then we're going to input it into a functionthat just takes things to the third power.So it just takes things to the third power.And so what are you going to end up with?Well, you're going to end up with,what are you taking to the third power?You're taking cosine of x.Cosine of x to the third power.This is a composite function.You could view this,you could view this as the function,let's call this blue one, the function vand let's call this the function uand so if we're taking x and into u,this is u of xand then if we're taking u of x into the inputor as the input into the function vthen this output right over here,this is going to be v of,well, what was inputted?V of u of x.V of u of xor another way of writing it,I'm going to write it multiple ways.That's the same thing as v of cosine of x.V of cosine of x.And so v, whatever you input into it,it just takes it to the third power.If you were to write v of x,it would be x to the third power.So the chain rule tells usor the chain rule is what our brain should say.Hey, it becomes applicableif we're going to take the derivative of a functionthat can be expressed as a composite function like this.So just to be clear, we can write f of x.f of x is equal to v of u of x.I know I'm essentially saying the same thingover and over againbut I'm saying it in slightly different waysbecause the first time you learn this,it can be a little bit hard to grokor really deeply understandso I'm going to try to write it in different ways.And the chain rule tells usthat if you have a situation like thisthen the derivative, f prime of x,and this is something that you will see in your textbooks.Well, this is going to bethe derivative of this whole thingwith respect to u of xso we could write that as v prime of u of x.V prime of u of xtimes the derivative of u with respect to x.Times u prime of x.This right over here,this is one expression of the chain ruleand so how do we evaluate it in this case?Well, let me color code it in a similar way.So the v function,this outer thing that just takes things to the third power,I'll put in blue.So f prime of x,another way of expressing itand I'll use it with more of the differential notation,you could view this as the derivative of,well, I'll write it a couple of different ways.You could view it as the derivative of v.The derivative of vwith respect to u.I want to get the colors right.The derivative of v with respect to u,that's what this thing is right over here,times the derivative of uwith respect to x.So times the derivative of u with respect to x.And just to be clear,so you're familiar with the different notationsyou'll see in different textbooks,this is this right over here just using different notationsand this is this right over here.So let's actually evaluate these things.You're probably tired of just talking in the abstract.So this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal toand I'm going to write it out again,this is the derivative,instead of just writing v and u,I'm going to write it, let me write this way.This is going to be,I keep wanting, I'm using the wrong colors.This is going to be the derivative of,and I'm going to leave some space,times the derivative of something elsewith respect to something elseso we're going to have to first take the derivative of v.Well, v iscosine of x to the third power.Cosine of x.We're going to take the derivative of thatwith respect to u which is just cosine of xand we're going to multiply thattimes the derivative of u which is cosine of xwith respect to x.With respect to x.So this one, we have good,we've seen this before.We know that the derivative with respect to xof cosine of x.Cosine.We use it in that same color.The derivative of cosine of x,well, that's equal to negative sine of x.So this one right over here, that is negative sine of x.You might be more familiar with seeingthe derivative operated this waybut in theory, you won't see this as oftenbut this helps my brain really grok what we're doing.We're taking the derivative of cosine of xwith respect to x.Well, that's going to be negative sine of x.Well, what about taking the derivativeof cosine of x to the third powerwith respect to cosine of x?What is this thing over here mean?Well, if I were taking the derivative,if I was taking the derivative of,let me write it this way,if I was taking the derivative of x to the third power,x to the third power with respect to x,if it was like that,well, this is just going to beand let me put some brackets hereto make it a little bit clear.If I'm taking the derivative of that,that is going to be,that is going to be,we bring the exponent out front.That's going to be three,three times x.Three times x to the second power.Three times x to the second power.So the general notion here isif I'm taking the derivative of something,whatever this something happens to be,let me do this in a new color.I'm doing the derivative of orange circle to the third powerwith respect to orange circle.Well, that's just going to be three times orangeor yellow circle.Let me make it an actual orange circle.So the derivative of orange circle to the third powerwith respect to orange circle,that's going to be three times the orange circle squared.So if I'm taking the derivative of cosine of xto the third power with respect to cosine of x,well, that's just going to be,this is just going to bethree times cosine of x,cosine of x to the second power.To the second power.Notice, one way to think about it.I'm taking the derivative of this outside functionwith respect to the inside.So I would do the same thingas taking the derivative of x to the third powerbut instead of an x, I have a cosine of xso instead of it being three x squared,it is three cosine of x squaredand then the chain rule says,if we want to get finally getthe derivative with respect to x,we then take the derivative of cosine of xwith respect to x.I know that's a big mouthful but we are at the homestretch.We've now figured out the derivative.It's going to be this times this.So let's see, that's going to be negative three,negative three times sine of xtimes cosine squared of xand I know that was kind of a long way of saying it.I'm trying to explain the chain rule at the same time.But once you get the hang of it, you're just going to say,alright, well, let me take the derivative of the outsideof something to the third power with respect to the inside.Let me just treat that cosine of x like as if it was an x.Well, that's going to be,if I do that, that's going to be three cosine squared of xso that's that part and that partand then let me take the derivative of the insidewith respect to x.Well, that is negative sine of x.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-chain-rule/v/differentiating-composite-functions-2	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So we have here f of xbeing equal to the natural log of the square root of x.And what we wanna do in this videois find the derivative of f.And the key here is to recognize that f can actuallybe viewed as a composition of two functions.And we can diagram that out, what's going on here?Well if you input an x into our function f,what's the first thing that you do?Well, you take the square root of it.So if we start off with some x, you input it,the first thing that you do, you take the square root of it.You are going to take the square root of the inputto produce the square root of x,and then what do you do?You take the square root and thenyou take the natural log of that.So then you take the natural log of that,so you could view that as inputting itinto another function that takes the natural logof whatever is inputted in.I'm making these little squares toshow what you do with the input.And then what do you produce?Well you produce the natural log of the square root of x.Natural log of the square root of x.Which is equal to f of x.So you could view f of x as this entire set,or this entire, I guess you could say,this combination of functions right over there.That is f of x, which is essentially,a composition of two functions.You're inputting into one functionthen taking that output and inputting it into another.So you could have a function u here,which takes the square root of whatever its input is,so u of x is equal to the square root of x.And then you take that output,and input it into another function that we could call v,and what does v do?Well it take the natural log of whatever the input is.In this case, in the case of f, or in the case of howI just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log,the input happens to be square root of x,so it outputs the natural log of the square root of x.If we wanted to write v with x as an input,we would just say well that's the natural log,that is just the natural log of x.And as you can see here, f of x,and I color-coded ahead of time,is equal to, f of x is equal to,the natural log of the square root of x.So that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x.So it is a composition which tells you that,okay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here,the chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful.And the chain rule tells us that f prime of xis going to be equal to the derivative of,you can view it as the outside function,with respect to this inside function,so it's going to be v prime of u of x,v prime of u of x,times the derivative of this inside functionwith respect to x.So that's just u prime, u prime of x.So how do we evaluate these things?Well, we know how to take the derivative of u of xand v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to,well remember, square root of x is just the same thingas x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule,bring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the,and then take off one out of that exponent,so that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power.And what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x?Well the derivative of the natural log of xis one over x, we show that in other videos.And so we now know what u prime of x is,we know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x?Well v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x,we replace it, let me write that a little bit neater,we replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of xis going to be equal to,is going to be equal to one over u of x,one over u of x, which is equal to,which is equal to one over,u of x is just the square root of x.One over the square root of x.This thing right over here, we have figured out,is one over the square root of x,and this thing, u prime of x, we figured out,is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,and x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2times one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thingas 1/2 times one over the square root of x,or I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x.So what is this thing going to be?Well this is going to be equal to, in green,v prime of u of x is one over the square root of x,times, times, u prime of x is one over two timesthe square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to?Well, this is going to be equal to,this is just algebra at this point,one over, we have our two and square root of xtimes square root of x is just x.So it just simplifies to one over two x.So hopefully this made sense,and I intentionally diagrammed it outso that you start to get that muscle in your brain goingof recognizing the composite functions,and then making a little bit more sense ofsome of these expressions of the chain rulethat you might see in your calculus class,or in your calculus textbook.But as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it,essentially, without having to write out all of this.You'll say okay, look, I have a composition.This is the natural log of the square root of x,this is v of u of x.So what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivativeof this outside function with respectto this inside function.So the derivative of natural log of something,with respect to that something, is one over that something.So it is one over that something,the derivative natural log of somethingwith respect to that something is one over that something,so that's what we just did here.One way to think about it, what would natural log of x be?Well that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x.It's one over square root of x,so it's going to be one over the square root of x,so you take the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside one,and then you multiply that times just the derivativeof the inside function with respect to x.And we are done.

So let's say that we have y is equal tothe secant of three pi over two minus x.And what we wanna do is, we wanna figure out whatdy/dx is, the derivative of y with respect to x is,at x equal pi over four.Like always, pause this video and see if you couldfigure it out.Well as you can see here, we have a composite function.We're taking the secant, not just of x,but you could view this as of another expressionthat x could define, or as of a, of another function.So for example, if you call this right over here, u of x,let's do that.So if we say u of x is equal to three pi over two minus x,we could also figure out u prime of xis going to be equal to derivative of three pi over two,that's just going to be a zero,derivative of minus x, well that's just gonna beminus one, and you could just view that as a power rule.It's one times negative one, times x to the zero power,which is just one.So there you go.So we could view this as the derivative of the secantwith respect to u of x, that when we take the derivative,the derivative of secant with respect to u of x,times the derivative of u with respect to x.And you might say,""Well, what about the derivative of secant?""Well in other videos, we actually prove it out,and you could actually re-derive it.Secant is just one over cosine of x,so it comes straight out of the chain rule.So, in other videos, we prove that the,the derivative of the secant of x,of the secant of x, is equal to, is equal to sin of x,over cosine of x, over cosine of x squared.So if we're trying to find the derivative of ywith respect to x, well it's going to be the derivativeof secant with respect to u of x,times the derivative of u with respect to x.So let's do that.The derivative of secant with respect to u of x,well, instead of seeing an x everywhere,you're gonna see a u of x everywhere.So this is going to be,sin of u of x,sin of u of x,and I could, I don't have to write u of x,I could write three pi over two minus x,but I'll write u of x right over here just toreally visualize what we're doing.So sin of u of x,over,over,cosine squared of u of x,cosine squared,and we do those parentheses in the blue colorjust to make sure that you identify itwith the trig function.So cosine squared of u of x, u of x,so that's the derivative of secant with respect to u of x,and then the chain rule tells us it's gonna bethat times u prime, u prime of x.So what is this going to be equal to?Well, I could just substitute back.This is going to be equal to, I will write it like this.Sin of u of x, which is three pi over two minus x,and I'll fill that in in a second,over cosine of u of x squared,times u prime of x,u of x is three pi over two minus x,three pi over two minus x.And then u prime of x, we already figured out,is negative one, so I could write,times negative one, oh, yeah.Let me just leave it out there for now.I could have just put a negative out front,but I really want you to be able to seewhat I'm doing here.And now we want to evaluate at x equals pi over four.So that is equal to pi over four.Pi over four.So let's see, this is going to be,this is going to be equal to sin of,what's three pi over two minus pi over four?I'll do that over here.So we have a common denominator,that is six pi over four,the same thing as three pi over two,minus pi over four,minus pi over four, is equal to five,five pi over four.So it's sin of five pi over four,five pi over four,over cosine squared of five pi over four,and then times negative one, I can just put that out here.Now what is sin of five pi over fourand cosine squared of five pi over four?Well, I don't have that memorized, but,let's actually draw a unit circleand we should be able to,we should be able to figure out what that is.So, a unit circle,I try to hand draw it as best as I can.Please forgive me that this circle does not lookreally like a circle, alright.Okay.So, let me just remember my angles.So, I, I in my brain, I sometimes convert into degrees.Pi over four is 45 degrees.This is pi over two, this is three pi over four,this is four pi over four,this is five pi over four,lands you right over there.So if you wanted to see where you intersect the unit circle,this is at the point, this is at the point.Your x-coordinate is negative square root of two over two,negative square root of two over two,and your y-coordinate is negative square rootof two over two.If you are wondering how I got that,I encourage you to review the unit circleand some of the standard angles around the unit circle.You'll see that in the trigonometry sectionof Khan Academy.But this is enough for us, because the sinis the y-coordinate, it's the y-coordinate here.So negative square root of two over two.So this is negative square root of two over two.And then, the cosine is the x-coordinate,which is also negative square root of two over two,it's going to be that squared.Negative square root of two over two, we're squaring it.So if we square this, it's gonna become,this is going to become, it's gonna become positive.And then square root of two squared is two,and then two squared is four.So it's one half.So this is, the denominator's equal to one half.See the numerator, this negativecancels out with that negative.And so we are left with,we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.We are left with square root of two over two,that's the numerator,divided by one half, well that's the same thingas multiplying by two.So we are left with positive square root of two,is the slope of the tangent line,to the graph of y is equal to thiswhen x is equal to pi over four.Pretty exciting."

Let's see if we can take the derivativewith respect to x of the fourth rootof x to the third power plus four x squared plus seven.And at first you might say, ""All right,""how do I take the derivative of the fourth root""of something, it looks like I have a composite function,""I'm taking the fourth root of another expression?""And you'd be right.And if you're dealing with a composite function,the chain rule should be front of mind.But first, let's just make this fourth roota little bit more tractable for us.And just realize that this fourth rootis nothing but a fractional exponent.So this is the same thing as the derivativewith respect to x of x to the third plus four x squaredplus seven to the 1/4 power,to the 1/4 power.Now, how do we take the derivative of this?Well, we can view this, as I said a few seconds ago,we can view this as a composite function.What do we do first with our x?Well, we do all of this business,and we can call this u of x.And then whatever we get for u of x,we raise that to the fourth power.So the way that we would take the derivative,we would take the derivative of this,you could view it as the outer functionwith respect to u of x and then multiply thattimes the derivative of u with respect to x.So let's do that.So what this is going to be,this is going to be equal to,so we're gonna take our outside function,which I'm highlighting in green now,so, or I take something to the 1/4,I'm gonna take the derivative of that with respectto the inside, with respect to u of x.Well, I'm just gonna use the power rule here.I'm just gonna bring that 1/4 out front,so it's gonna be 1/4 timeswhatever I'm taking the derivative with respect to,to the 1/4 minus one power.Look, all I did was use the power rule here.I didn't have an x here.Now I'm taking the derivative with respect to u of x,with respect to this polynomial expression here.So I could just throw the u of x in here if I like,actually let me just do that.So, this is going to be x to the thirdplus four x squared plus seven.And then I wanna multiply that,and this is the chain rule.I took the derivative of the outsidewith respect to the inside and then I'm gonna multiply thattimes the derivative of the inside.So what's the derivative of u of x?U prime of x, let's see we just gonna usethe power rule a bunch of times,it's gonna be three x squaredplus two times four is eight xto the two minus one is just one power, first power,so I can just write that as eight x,and then the derivative with respect to x of seven,well, the derivative with respect to x of a constantis just gonna be zero.So that's u prime of x.So then I'm just gonna multiply by u prime of xwhich is three x squared plus,three x squared plus eight x.And so, well, I can clean this up a little bit,so this would be equal to,this would be equal to.Actually let me just rewrite that exponent there.So this 1/4 minus one, I can rewrite it,1/4 minus one is negative 3/4,negative 3/4,negative 3/4 power.And you can manipulate this in different ways, if you like,but the key is to just recognize that this isan application of the chain rule.Derivative of the outside, well, actually,the first thing to realize is the fourth rootis the same thing as taking something to the 1/4 power,basic exponent property, and then realize,okay, I have a composite function here.So I can take the derivative of the outsidewith respect to the inside, that's what we did here,times the derivative of the inside with respect to x.And so if someone were to tell you,if someone were to say, ""All right, f of x,""f of x is equal to the fourth root of""x to the third plus four x squared plus seven,""and then they said, ""Well, what is f prime of""I don't know, negative three?""Well, you would evaluate this at negative three.So let me just do that.So it's 1/4 times,see, you have negative 27,I hope this works out reasonably well,plus 36, plus 36,plus 7 to the negative 3/4,what does this result to?This is going to be equal to,this right over here is 16, right?Negative 27 plus seven is negative 20plus 36, so this is 16.I think this is going to work out nicely.And then timesthree times negative, so three times nine,which is 27 minus 24.So this is going to be right over here,that is going to be three.Now, what is 16 to the negative 3/4?So this is 1/4 times, so 16 times to the 1/4is two and then you raise that to the,let me, actually I don't want to skip steps here.At this point we're dealing with algebra,or maybe even pre-algebra.So this is going to be times, times,16 to the 1/4,and then we're gonna raise that to the negative threetimes that three out front.So we could put that three there.16 to the 1/4 is two,two to the third is eight,so two to the negative third power is 1/8,so that is 1/8.So we have 3/4 times 1/8which is equal to three over 32, 3/32.So that would be the slope of the tangent lineof the graph y is equal to f of xwhen x is equal to negative three."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-implicit-differentiation/v/implicit-differentiation-1	khanacademy	video	:00So we've got the equation x squaredplus y squared is equal to 1.I guess we could call it a relationship.And if we were to graph all of the points x and ythat satisfied this relationship,we get a unit circle like this.And what I'm curious about in this videois how we can figure out the slope of the tangent lineat any point of this unit circle.And what immediately might be jumping out in your brain is,well a circle defined this way, this isn't a function.It's not y explicitly defined as a function of x.For any x value we actually have two possible y'sthat satisfy this relationship right over here.So you might be tempted to maybe split this upinto two separate functions of x.You could say y is equal to the positive square root of 1minus x squared.And you could say y is equal to the negative square root of 1minus x squared.Take the derivatives of each of these separately.And you would be able to find the derivative for any x,or the derivative of the slope of the tangent lineat any point.But what I want to do in this videois literally leverage the chain ruleto take the derivative implicitly.So that I don't have to explicitly define yis a function of x either way.And the way we do that is literally justapply the derivative operator to both sides of this equation.And then apply what we know about the chain rule.Because we are not explicitly defining yas a function of x, and explicitly getting yis equal to f prime of x, they callthis-- which is really just an application of the chain rule--we call it implicit differentiation.And what I want you to keep in the back of your mindthe entire time is that it's justan application of the chain rule.So let's apply the derivative operator to both sides of this.So it's the derivative with respectto x of x squared plus y squared, on the left handside of our equation.And then that's going to be equal to the derivativewith respect to x on the right hand side.I'm just doing the same exact thingto both sides of this equation.Now if I take the derivative of the sum of two terms,that's the same thing as taking the sum of the derivative.So this is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to x of x squared,plus the derivative with respect to x of y squared.I'm writing all my orange stuff first.So let's see.This is going to be x squared, this is going to be y squared.And then this is going to be equal to the derivativewith respect to x of a constant.This isn't changing with respect to x.So we just get 0.Now this first term right over here,we have done many, many, many, many, many, many times.The derivative with respect to x of x squaredis just the power rule here.It's going to be 2 times x to the first power.We could just say 2x.Now what's interesting is what we're doing right over here.The derivative with respect to x of y squared.And the realization here is to just apply the chain rule.If we're taking the derivative with respectto x of this something, we just haveto take the derivative-- let me make it clear--we're just going to take the derivative of our something.The derivative of y squared-- that's what we're taking,you can kind of view that as a function-- with respect to yand then multiply that times the derivative of ywith respect to x.We're assuming that y does change with respect to x. yis not some type of a constant that we'rewriting just an abstract terms.So we're taking the derivative of this whole thingwith respect to y.Once again, just the chain rule.And then we're taking the derivative of ywith respect to x.It might be a little bit clearer if you kind of thoughtof it as the derivative with respect to x of y,as a function of x.This might be, or y is a function of x squared,which is essentially another way of writing what we have here.This might be a little bit clearerin terms of the chain rule.The derivative of y is a functionof x squared with respect to y of x.So the derivative of something squared with respectto that something, times the derivative of that something,with respect to x.This is just the chain rule.I want to say it over and over again.This is just the chain rule.So let's do that.What do we get on the right hand side over here?And I'll write it over here as well.This would be equal to the derivative of y squaredwith respect to y, is just going to be 2 times y.2 times y, just an application of the chain rule.And the derivative of y with respect to x?Well, we don't know what that is.So we're just going to leave that as times the derivativeof y with respect to x.So let's just write this down over here.So we have is 2x plus the derivative of somethingsquared, with respect to that something, is 2 timesthe something.In this case, the something is y, so 2 times y.And then times the derivative of y with respect to x.And this is all going to be equal to 0.Now that was interesting.Now we have an equation that has the derivativeof a y with respect to x in it.And this is what we essentially want to solve for.This is the slope of the tangent line at any point.So all we have to do at this point is solvefor the derivative of y with respect to x.Solve this equation.So let's do that.And actually just so we can do this whole thingon the same page so we can see where we started, let me copyand paste this up here.This is where we left off.And let's continue there.So let's say let's subtract 2x from both sides.So we're left with 2y times the derivative of y,with respect to x, is equal to-- we're subtracting 2xfrom both sides-- so it's equal to negative 2x.And if we really want to solve for the derivative of ywith respect to x, we can just divide both sides by 2y.And we're left with the derivative of ywith respect to x.Let's scroll down a little bit.The derivative of y with respect to xis equal to, well the 2s cancel out.We we're left with negative x over y.So this is interesting.We didn't have to us explicitly define yas a function of x here.But we got our derivative in terms of an x and a y.Not just only in terms of an x.But what does this mean?Well, if we wanted to find, let'ssay we wanted to find the derivative at this pointright over here.Which, if you're familiar with the unit circle,so if this was a 45 degree angle,this would be the square root of 2 over 2 commathe square root of 2 over 2.What is the slope of the tangent line there?Well, we figured it out.It's going to be negative x over y.So the slope of the tangent line hereis going to be equal to negative x.So negative square root of 2 over 2 over y.Over square root of 2 over 2, which is equal to negative 1.And that looks just about right.

I want to show you in this videois that implicit differentiation will give youthe same result as, I guess we can say,explicit differentiation when youcan differentiate explicitly.So let's say that I have the relationshipx times the square root of y is equal to 1.This one is actually pretty straightforwardto define explicitly in terms of x, to solve for y.So if we divide both sides by x, we get square root of yis equal to 1/x.And then if you square both sides, you get y is equal to 1over x squared, which is the same thing as xto the negative 2 power.And so if you want the derivative of ywith respect to x, this is pretty straightforward.This is just an application of the chain rule.So we get dy dx is equal to negative 2 xto the negative 2 minus 1-- x to the negative 3 power.So that's pretty straightforward.But what I want to see is if we get the same exact resultwhen we differentiate implicitly.So let's apply our derivative operatorto both sides of this equation.And so let me make it clear what we'redoing-- x times the square root of y and 1 right over there.When you apply the derivative operatorto the expression on the left-hand side,well, actually, we're going to apply both the productrule and the chain rule.The product rule tells us-- so wehave the product of two functions of x.You could view it that way.So this, the product rule tells us thisis going to be the derivative with respectto x of x times the square root of y plus x,not taking its derivative, times the derivativewith respect to x of the square root of y.Let me make it clear, this bracket.And on the right-hand side, right over here,the derivative with respect to x of this constant,that's just going to be equal to 0.So what does this simplify to?Well, the derivative with respect to x of x is just 1.This simplifies to 1, so we're justgoing to be left with the square root of y right over here.So this is going to simplify to a square root of y.And what does this over here simplify to?Well the derivative with respect to x of the square root of y,here we want to apply the chain rule.So let me make it clear.So we have plus this x plus whatever business this is.And I'm going to do this in blue.Well, it's going to be the derivative of the square rootof something with respect to that something.Well, the derivative of the square rootof something with respect to that something,or the derivative of something to the 1/2with respect to that something, is going to be 1/2 timesthat something to the negative 1/2 power.Once again, this right over here is the derivativeof the square root of y with respect to y.We've seen this multiple times.If I were to say the derivative of the square root of xwith respect to x, you would get 1/2 x to the negative 1/2.Now I'm just doing it with y's.But we're not done yet.Remember, our derivative operatorwasn't to say with respect to y.It's with respect to x.So this only gets us with respect to y.We need to apply the entire chain rule.We have to multiply that times the derivative of ywith respect to x in order to get the real derivativeof this expression with respect to x.So let's multiply times the derivativeof y with respect to x.We don't know what that is.That's actually what we're trying to solve for.But to use the chain rule, we justhave say it's the derivative of the square root of ywith respect to y times the derivative of ywith respect to x.This is the derivative of this thing with respect to x.So we get this on the left-hand side.On the right-hand side, we just have a 0.And now, once again, we can attemptto solve for the derivative of y with respect to x.And maybe the easiest first step isto subtract the square root of y from both sidesof this equation.And actually, let me move all of this stuff over,so I have, once again, more room to work with.So let me cut it, actually.And then let me paste it.Let me move it over, right over here.So we went from there to there.I didn't gain a lot of real estate,but hopefully this helps a little bit.And actually, I don't even like that.Let me leave it where it was before.So then, if we subtract the square root of yfrom both sides-- and I'll try to simplifyas I go-- we get this thing, which I can rewrite as xtimes-- well, it's just going to be x in the numerator dividedby 2 times the square root of y. y to the negative 1/2is just the square root of y in the denominator.And 1/2, I just put the 2 in the denominatorthere-- times dy dx times the derivative of ywith respect to x is going to be equalto the negative square root of y.I just subtracted the square root of y from both sides.And actually, this is something that I might actuallywant to copy and paste up here.So copy and then paste.So let's go back up here, just to continue our simplificationsolving for dy dx.Well, to solve for dy dx, we justhave to divide both sides by x over 2 times the square rootof y.So we're left with dy dx-- or dividing both sidesby this is the same thing as multiplyingby the reciprocal of this-- is equal to 2times the square root of y over x-- over my yellow x--times the negative square root of y.Well, what's this going to simplify to?This is going to be equal to y times--the square root of y times the square root of y is just y.The negative times the 2, you get negative 2.So you get negative 2y over x is equal to the derivative of ywith respect to x.Now you might be saying, look, we justfigured out the derivative implicitly,and it looks very different than what we did right over here.When we just used the power rule, we got negative 2 xto the negative third power.The key here is to realize that this thing right over herewe could solve explicitly in terms of-- wecould solve for y.So we could just make this substitutionback here to see that these are the exact same thing.So if we make the substitution y is equal to 1 over x squared,you would get dy dx, the derivative of y with respectto x, is equal to our negative 2 times 1 over x squared,and then all of that over x, which is equal to negative 2over x to the third, which is exactly what we have over here,negative 2 x to the negative third power.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-implicit-differentiation-advanced-examples/v/implicit-derivative-of-e-xy-2-x-y	khanacademy	video	:00So let's take another implicit derivativeof the somewhat crazy relationship.And I've graphed the relationship here.As you can see, it is actually quite bizarre.e to the x times y squared is equal to x minus y.This is some at least in the range that's depicted here,the x's and the y's that satisfy this relationship.Well let's take the derivative of both sides.So we'll apply our derivative operator to both sides.And actually this is a good chanceto maybe explore some different notation.We tend to be using that notation,but oftentimes you'll see a derivative operator thatjust looks like a big capital D. So maybe we'lldo that right over here.So let me make it clear.This is the equivalent of saying d over dx.I'll just use this big capital D operatorso that you are familiar with the notation.And instead of using dy dx for the derivative of ywith respect to x, I'm just going to write that as y prime.So we get a little bit of practicewith different notation.So let's take the derivative of this thing right over here.Well we're going to apply the chain rule.Actually, we're going to apply the chain rulemultiple times here.The derivative of e to the something with respectto that something is going to be eto the something times the derivativeof that something with respect to x.So times the derivative of xy squared.So that's our left-hand side.We aren't done taking the derivative yet.And on our right-hand side, the derivative of x is just 1.And the derivative with respect to x of yis just going to be minus-- or I could write-- negative dy dx.But instead of writing dy dx, I'm going to write y prime.As you can tell, I like this notation and this notationmore because it makes it explicitthat I'm taking the derivative with respect to x.Here, we just have to assume that we'retaking the derivative with respect to x.Here, we have to assume that's the derivative of ywith respect to x.But anyway let's stick with this notation right over here.Actually, let me make all of my y primes,all my derivatives of y with respect to x,let me make them pink so I keep track of them.So once again, this is going to beequal to e to the xy squared times the derivative of this.Well the derivative of this, we can justuse the product and actually a little bit of the chain rulehere.So the derivative of x is just 1 times the second function.So it's going to be times y squared.And then to that, we're going to addthe product of the first function whichis this x times the derivative of y squared with respect to x.Well that's going to be the derivative of y squaredwith respect to y, which is just going to be 2ytimes the derivative of y with respectto x, which we are now writing as y prime.And then that's going to be equal to 1 minus y prime.And like we've been doing, we nowhave to just solve for y prime.So let's distribute this exponential, this eto the xy squared.And we get e, or maybe I should say y squared times eto the xy squared.So that's that.Plus 2xye to the xy squared.y prime, the derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to 1 minus the derivative of y with respectto x.Now let's get all of our y primes on one side.So let's add y prime to both sides.So let's add-- and just to be clear,I'm adding one y prime to both sides.So let's add a y prime to both sides.And let's subtract this business from both sides.So let's subtract y squared e to the xy squaredsubtracting from both sides.So we're going to subtract y squared e to the xy squared.And we are left with 2xye to the xysquared plus 1 times y prime.We had this many y primes and thenwe add another 1y prime so we have this many plus 1 y primes.That's going to be equal to-- well, I purposelyadded y prime to both sides and so we are left with 1minus-- this is kind of a crazy expression-- y squared times eto the xy squared.And now we just have to divide both sides by this.And we're left with the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to this, which I will just copy and paste.Actually, let me just rewrite it.Scroll down a little bit.It's equal to 1 minus y squared eto the xy squared over this business.Let me get some more space.2xye to the xy squared plus 1.And we're done.It was kind of crazy, but fundamentally no differentthan what we've been doing in the last few examples.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-implicit-differentiation-advanced-examples/v/derivative-natural-logarithm	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We know that the derivativewith respect to x,of e to the x, is equalto e to the x, which I think is oneof the neatest things in mathematics.It just builds my respect for the number e.But that's not what we're here to do, to just praise e.What we really want to think about is,what's the derivative of the inverse function?What's the derivative, with respectto x, of the natural log of x?We've done this several times, where we knowthe derivative of a function and we now wantto find the derivative of the inverse function.What we can do, let's say y isequal to the natural log of x.This is another way of saying that yis the power that we raise e to, to get to x.So, this is equivalent to saying that eto the y power is equal to x.Now we can take the derivative of bothsides of this equation with respect to x.So let's do that.The derivative of both sides with respectto x, do a little bit of implicit differentiation.Really just an application of the chain rule.So, on the left-hand side right over here,this is going to be the derivative of e to the ywith respect to y, which is just going to be e to the ytimes the derivative of y with respect to x.On the right hand side here, the derivativeof x with respect to x is one.Now, to solve for the derivative,we just divide both sides by e to the y.We get the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to one over e to the y power.Now, what is y equal to?Well, we know that y is equal to the natural log of x.So let's write that down.This is equal to one over e to the natural log of x.What is e to the natural log of x going to be?The natural log of x is the powerI need to raise e to, to get to x.So if I actually raise e to that power,to that exponent, I'm going to get x.This is going to be equal to one over x.So this thing simplifies to x.We are done.We just figured out if y is equalto the natural log of x, the derivativeof y with respect to x is one over x.Or you could say the derivative of the natural logof x with respect to x is equal to one over x.So this is equal to, this rightover here, is equal to one over x.One over x, which is also a prettyneat result in mathematics.Not quite as exciting as this one, but still pretty neat.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-differentiating-inverse-functions/v/derivatives-of-inverse-functions-implicit	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let F of X be equal to one half X to the thirdplus three X minus four.Let H be the inverse of F.Notice that F of negative two is equal to negative 14.And then they're asking us what is H prime of negative 14?And if you're not familiar with the how functionsand their derivatives relate to their inversesand the derivatives of the inverse, well this willseem like a very hard thing to do.Because if you're attempting to take the inverse of Fto figure out what H iswell, it's tough to find, to taketo figure out the inverse of a third degreea third degree polynomial defined function like this.So, the keythe key, I guess property to realize,or the key truth to realizeif F and H are inversesthen H prime of XH prime of Xis going to be equal tois going to be equal to one overF prime of H of X.One over F prime of H of X.And you could now use thisin order to figure out what H prime ofnegative 14 is.Now I know what some of you are thinking,because it's exactly what I would be thinkingif someone just sprung this on me iswhere does this come from?And I would tell you, this comes straight outof the chain rule.We know that if a function and its inversewe know that if we have a function and its inversethat F of F of the inverse of our function.So F of H of X.F of H of X.We know that this is going to be to X.This literally, this iscomes out of them being each others inverses.We could have also said H of F of Xwill also be equal to X.Remember, F is going to mapor H is going to map from some X to H of X.And then F is going to map back to that original X.That's what inverses do.So that's because they are inverses.This is by definition, this is what inversesdo to each other.And then if you took the derivative ofboth sides of thiswhat would you get?Let me do that.So if we took the derivativeof the both sides of thisD D X on the left hand side.D D X on the right hand side.I think you see where this is going.You are essentially gonna get a version of that.The left hand side used the chain rule.You're going to get F prime of H of X.F prime of H of Xtimes H prime of Xcomes straight out of the chain ruleis equal to, is equal to the derivative of Xis just going to be equal to one.And then you derive, you divide both sides byF prime of H of Xand you get our original property there.So now with that out of the waylet's just actually apply this.So, we want to evaluate H prime of 14.Or sorry, H prime of negative 14.Is going to be equal toone over F prime ofH of negative 14.H of negative 14.Now had they given us H of negative 14.But they didn't give it to us explicitly,we have to remember that F and H are inversesof each other.So F of negative two is negative 14.Well, H is gonna go from the other way around.If you input negative 14 into Hyou're going to get negative two.So H of negative 14well, this is going to be equal tonegative two.Once again, they are inverses of each other.So H of negative 14 is equal tonegative negative two.And once again, I just swapped these two around.That's what the inverse function will do.If you're wrapping from if F goes fromnegative two to negative 14H is going to go from negative 14back to negative two.So now we want to evaluate F prime of negative two.Well, let's figure out what F prime of X is.So, F prime of X is equal toremember the power rule, so three times one halfis three halvestimes X to the three minus one powerwhich is the second power.Plus the derivative of three Xwith respect to X which that's just going to be three.And you could do that, it's just the power rule.But this was X to the first power,one times three,X to the zero power,but X to the zero is just oneso you're just left with three.And derivative of a concept that's just gonna be zero.So that's F prime of X.So F prime of, F prime of negative twois going to be three halvestimes negative two squared is four, positive four.So plus three.So, this is going to be equal totwo times three plus three.So, six plus three is equal to nine.So this denominator here is going to be equal to nine.So this whole thing is equal to one over nine.So this involved, this was something you're notgoing to see every day.This isn't that typical problem in your calculus class.But it's interesting.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-derivatives-of-inverse-trigonometric-functions/v/derivative-inverse-sine	khanacademy	video	:00What I would like to explore in this video, is to see ifwe could figure out the derivative of Y is with respect to X.If Y is equal to the inverse sine, the inverse sine of X.And like always, I encourage you to pause thisvideo and try to figure this out on your own.And I will give you two hints.First hint is, well, we don't know what the derivative of sine inverse of x is,but we do know what the si-, what the derivative of the sine of something is.And so if you, maybe if you rearrange this and usesome implicit differentiation, maybe you can figure out what dy, dx is.Remember, this is right over here.This right over here is our goal.But, since you want to figure our the derivative of this with respect to x.So, assuming you've had a go at it, so let's work through this together.So, if y is the inverse sine of x, that's justlike saying that, that's equivalent to saying that sine of y.Sine of Y is equal to X.Sine of Y is equal to X.So now we have things that we're a little bit more familiarwith, and now we can do a little bit of implicit differentiation.We can take the derivative of both sides with respect to X.So, derivative of the left-hand side with respect to Xand the derivative of the right-hand side with respect to X.But what's the derivative of the left-hand side with respect to X going to be?And here we just apply the chain rule.It's going to be the derivative of sine of Y with respect to Y.Which is going to be, which is going to be cosineof Y times the derivative of Y with respect to X.So times dy, dx, times dy,dx.And the right-hand side, what's the derivate of X with respectto X, well that's obviously just going to be equal to one.And so we could solve for dy,dx, divide both sides by cosine of Y.And we get the derivative of Y with respectto X is equal to one over cosine of Y.Now this still isn't that satisfying cuz I have the derivative in terms of Y.So let's see if we can re-express it in terms of X.So, how could we do that?Well, we already know that X is equal to sine of Y.Let me rewrite it.We already know that X is equal to sine of Y.So, if we could rewrite this bottomexpression in terms, instead of cosine of Y.If we could use our trigonometric identitiesto rewrite it in terms of sine ofY, then we'll be in good shape because X is equal to sine of Y.Well, how can we do that?Well, we know from our trigonometric identities, we knowthat sine squared of Y plus cosine squared of Y is equal to one.Or, if we want to solve for cosine ofY, subtract sine squared of Y from both sides.We know that cosine squared of Y is equal to one minus sine squared of Y.Or that cosine of Y, just take the principal root of both sides,is equal to the principal root of one minus sine squared of Y.So, we could rewrite this as being equal to one over, one over, insteadof cosine of Y, we could rewrite it as one minus sine squared of Y.Now why is this useful?Well, sine of Y is just X.So this is the same if we just substitute back in, letme just write it that way so it's a little bit clear.I could write it as sine Y squared.We know that this thing right over here is X.So this is going to be equal to, and we deserve a little bit of a drumroll.One over the square root of one minus, instead of sinof Y, we know that X is equal to sin of Y.So, one minus X squared.And so, there you have it.The derivative with respect to X of the inverse sine of X is equal to one overthe square root of one minus X squared, so let me just make that very clear.If you were to take the derivative with respect to X of both sides ofthis, you get dy,dx is equal to this on the right-hand side.Or we could say the derivative with respect to X of the inverse sineof X is equal to one over the square root of one minus X squared.Now you could always reprove this if your memory starts to failyou, and actually, that is the best way to really internalize this.But this is also just a good thing to know, especially as westart, as we go into more and more calculus and you see, you mightsee this in expression and you might say, oh, okay, you know, that'sthe derivative of the inverse sine of X, which might prove to be useful.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-derivatives-of-inverse-trigonometric-functions/v/derivative-inverse-cosine	khanacademy	video	:00Voiceover: In the last video, we showed orwe proved to ourselves that thederivative of the inverse sine of xis equal to 1 over the square rootof 1 minus x squared.What I encourage you to do in this videois to pause it and try to do the sametype of proof for the derivativeof the inverse cosine of x.So, our goal here is to figure out ...I want the derivative with respectto x of the inverse cosine,inverse cosine of x.What is this going to be equal to?So, assuming you've had a go at it,let's work through it.So, just like last time, we could write,let's just set y being equal to this.y is equal the inverse cosine of x,which means the same thing is sayingthat x is equal to the cosine,cosine of y.I'll just take the derivative ofboth sides with respect to x.On the left hand side, you're just going to have a 1.We're just going to have a 1.And on the right hand side,you're going to have the derivative ofcosine y with respect to y, whichis negative sine of y times thederivative of y with respect to x,which is dy, dx, and so we get ...Let's see if we divide both sides bynegative sine of y, we get dy, dx is equal tonegative 1 over sine of y.Now, like we've seen before, this is kind ofsatisfying, but we have our derivative in terms of y.We want it in terms of x.And we know that x is cosine of y, solet's see if we can rewrite thisbottom expression in terms ofcosine of y instead of sine y.Well, we know when we saw in thelast video from the pythagorean identitythat cosine squared of y plussine squared of y is equal to 1.We know that sine of y is equal to thesquare root of 1 minus cosine squared of y.So, this is equal to negative 1.This is just a manipulation of thepythagorean trig identity.This is equal to 1 minus cosine.I can write like this, cosine squared of y,but I'll write it like thisbecause it'll make it a little bit clearer.And what is cosine of y?Well, of course that is x, so this isequal to negative 1 over the square root of 1 minus.Instead of writing cosine y ...Instead of writing cosine y ...I'm trying to switch colors.Instead of writing cosine y,we could write 1 minus x,1 minus x squared, so there you have it.The derivative with respect to x of theinverse cosine of x is ... I think I lost that color,I'll do it in magenta ... is equal tonegative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared,so this is a neat thing.This right over here is a neat thing to know.And of course, we should compare it to the inverse,the derivative of the inverse sine.Actually, let me put them side by side,and we see that the only difference hereis the sign, so let me copy and paste that.I'll copy and paste it,I'm going to paste it down here,and now let's look at them side by side.So, we see for taking the derivativewith respect to x of the inverse cosinefunction, we have a negative.A negative 1 over the square root of1 minus x squared.If we're looking at the derivative withrespect to x of the inverse sine,it's the same expression except now it is positive.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-derivatives-of-inverse-trigonometric-functions/v/derivative-inverse-tangent	khanacademy	video	:00We already know that the derivative with respect to x oftangent of x is equal to the secant of x squared, which isof course the same thing of one over cosine of x squared.Now what we wanna do in this video, like we've done in the lastfew videos, is figure out what the derivative of the inverse function of thetangent of x is, or in particular, let's see if we can figure outwhat the derivative with respect to x of the inverse tangent of x is.And I encourage you to pause this video anduse a technique similar to the one, or veryclose to the one that we've used in thelast two videos, to figure out what this is.Well let's set y equal to the inverse tangentof x, y is equal to inverse tangent of x.That is the same thing as saying that the tangentof y, the tangent of y is equal to x.All I've done, now you can kind of think of itas I've just taken the tangent of both sides right overhere, and now we can take the derivative of both sideswith respect, the derivative of both sides with respect to x.And on the left hand side, we can just apply the chain rule.Derivative of tangent of y with respect to y, is going to be secantsquared of y, which is the same thing as one over cosine of y squared.I like to write it this way.It's it'll, keeps it a little bit simpler atleast in, in my brain, but when we're applyingthe [INAUDIBLE], it's gonna be the derivative of tangentof y with respect to y times the derivative ofy with respect to x, times the derivative of y with respect to x, and on the righthand side, the derivative of x with respect tox, well that's just going to be equal to one.And so we get, if we wanna solve for the derivative y withrespect to x, we just multiply both sides times the cosine of y squared.And we get the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to cosine of y squared.And like we've seen in previous videos,this isn't that satisfying because, you know, I'vewritten the derivative of y with respect to x as a, as a function of y.But what we're really interested in is writing it as a function of x,and to do that, we'd express this somehow in terms of the tangent of y.And the reason why the tangent of y is interesting isbecause we already know that tangent of y is equal to x.So we can rewrite this using a little bit of trigonometric identities.Then we can, with tangent of y, we cansubstitute all the tangent of y's with an x.So let's see if we can do that.And this seems a little bit tricky.They introduce a tangent of y, we'd wanna have a sine, divided by acosine, that's what tangent is, and this is just a straight up cosine squared y.So this is really gonna take a little bit more experimentation than atleast some of the other, the, than the last two examples we've done.So one thing we could do is we could say hey, let's just divide by one.Dividing by one never hurt anyone.So we could say this is the same thing,this is the same thing as cosine squared y.And I'm really doing this to, to see if Ican in, start to express it as some type of arational, a rational expression which might involve, at some point,a sine divided by cosine and it could have a tangent.So, let's divide by one.But we know from the Pythagorean, the Pythagorean identity that oneis equal to sine squared of y plus cosine squared of y, and so let'stry that or we could write cosine squared of y plus sine squared of y.Once again, why was I able to divide by this expression?Well, this expression by the Pythagorean identity, whichreally comes out of the unit circle definition oftrig functions, this is equal to one, soI have not changed the value of this expression.Now what makes this interesting is if Iwanted to introduce a sine divided by a cosine,I could just divide the numerator and thedenominator by cosine square, so lets do that, letsmultiply one over cosine or else divide thenumerator by cosine square of y and divide thedenominator, by cosine square of y, or multiply eachof them by one over cosine square of y.What's that going to give us?Well the numerator, these characters are going tocancel you're just going to have a one.And the denominator this time this this, that's going to be equal to one.And then you're gonna have sine squared, sine squared y over,over cosine squared y, and this is, this is the goal that I wastrying to achieve, I have a sine divided by cosine squared.So this right over here, this is the same thing, actually let mejust write it this way, let me, let me write it this way.This is the same thing as sine of y over cosine of y, cosine of y.Whole thing squared, which is of course the same thingas one over one plus tangent of y, tangent of y squared.This is equal to this.Now why is that useful?Well we know that x is equal to tangent of y.So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equalto one, one over, one plus tangent of y is equal to x,x squared, x squared, which is pretty exciting.We just figured out the derivative of y with respect to x.So the derivative of this thing with respectto x is one over one plus x squared.So we could write that right up here.So this is going to be equal to one overone plus x squared, and we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-strategy-in-differentiating-functions/v/correcting-work-on-derivative-strategies	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're gonna doin this video is look at the work of other peopleas they try to take derivativesand see if their reasoning is correctand if it's not correct,try to identify what they should have doneor where their reasoning went wrong.So over here it says Nate tried to findthe derivative of X squared plus five Xtimes sine of X.Here is his work.Is Nate's work correct?If not, what's his mistake?So pause the video and see if you can answer this.Is Nate's work correct,and if not, what's his mistake?All right so I'm assuming you've had a go at it.So let's work though this step by step.So over here he's just trying to applythe derivative operator to the expression.Which is exactly what he needed to do.He's trying to find the derivative of this thing,and he says okay this is a product of two expressions,and then he says okay, well this is gonna bethe same thing as the derivativeor this is the same thing as the product of the derivatives.Now this is a problem.You are probably familiar,if I take the derivative of the sum of two things.So the derivative with respect to X of F of Xplus G of X,that indeed is equal to the derivative of the firstF prime of X plus the derivative of the second,but that is not true if we are dealing with the productof functions.The derivative with respect to X of F of X, G of Xis not necessarily,maybe there's some very special circumstance,but in general it's not going to bejust the product of the derivative.It's not going to be just F prime of X, G prime of X.Here we would want to apply the product rule.This is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to the derivativeof the first function times the second function,plus the derivative, or let me write it this way.Plus the first function, not taking its derivative,times the derivative of the second function.So he should have applied the product rule here,and so let's do thatjust to see what his answer should have been.So what he should have done here,I'll get my correcting red pen out here.Say no that's not what he should have done.He says let's take the derivative of this first thing.So actually let me color code it.So the derivative of this is two X plus five.So it should have been two X plus fivetimes the second thing.So times sine of X.Times, we do it in another color.Time the sine of X,and then to that he would add the first thing,which is X squared plus five Xtimes the derivative of the second thing.So the derivative of sine of X is cosine of X.So this is what we should have been seeingat this step right over here.He shouldn't have just taken the productof the derivatives.He should have applied the product rule.So his work is not correct,and his mistake is that he didn't apply the product rule.He just assumed that the derivative of the productsis the same thing as the product of the derivatives.Let's do more examples.Okay so let's see.It says Katy tried to find the derivativeof two X squared minus four.All of that to the third power.Here's her work.Is Katy's work correct?If not, what is her mistake?So once again, pause the video.See if you can figure it out.All right now let's inspect Katy's work.So she's taking the derivative of this and let's see,over here it looks like she's takingthe derivative of the entire expressionwith respect to the inner expressionand that is close to applying the chain rule properlybut it's not applying the chain rule properly.So her work is not correct,and her mistake is she's not correctlyapplying the chain rule.Just as a review, the chain rule says look,if we're trying tot ake the derivative with respect to Xof F of G of X,F of G of X,that this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to the derivativeof the whole thing with respect to G of X.So I could write that as F prime of G of X.F prime of G of X times the derivative of the inner functionwith respect to X.Times G prime of X.So over here,we could view our F function as a thingthat takes its input and takes it to the third power,and so this right over here is F prime of G of X.So this thing is the F prime of G of Xbut she forgot to multiply it by the derivativeof the inner function with respect to X.So she forgot to multiply this times the derivativeof two X squared minus four with respect to X.Which is gonna be, let's see,the derivative of two X squared,power rule two times two is four,so it's gonna be four X to the first,and then the derivative of negative four is just a zero.So it's just gonna be times four X.So that's what she needed to do in order for itto be correct.So she had to have this times four X here.Times four X.So not correct.She didn't correctly apply the chain rule.So let's do another one of these.So here,it says Njoman tried to find the derivative of sineof seven X squared plus four X.Here's his work.Is Njoman's work correct?If not, what is his mistake?Pause the video, see if you can figure it out.All right, so it's a derivative of sine of this expression.So you'd wanna use the chain rule.In fact, using the chain rule you wanna findthe derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside.So the derivative of sine of somethingwith respect to that somethingis gonna be cosine of that something.So that's right,and then you wanna multiply thattimes the derivative of the inside with respect to X.So the derivative of seven X squared is 14 X.The derivative of four X is four.So this is actually, that step looks good.But then Njoman does something strange over here.This is the cosine of seven X squared plus four X.Then that whole thing times 14 X plus four,but they get confused where just lookingat these parentheses and this tends to happen sometimes.This is actually one of the key errorsthat the folks at the college board,AP folks told us about.Is that when dealing with these transcendental functionscosine, sine, tangent,natural log that are written like thisand people see the parenthesesand see another parentheses,their brain just says oh let me multiplythese two expressions in parentheses,but that's not right,because if we were to add parenthesesthis is what this is implying.So you can't just take the 14 X plus fourand multiply it by this,and assuming you're taking the cosine of the whole thing.So this is where Njoman makes the mistake.The work is not correct,and the mistake is trying to multiplythese two expressions and taking the cosineof the whole thing.Let's do one more of these.I find these strangely fun.All right this one is involved.Tom tried to find the derivative ofthe square root of X over X to the fourth.Here is his work.Is Tom's work correct?If not, what's his mistake?Pause the video and see if you can figure that out.So it looks like he's trying to apply the quotient rule.So applying the quotient rule, you would,in the numerator you would take the derivativeof the first expression times the second expressionand then minus the first expressiontimes the derivative of the second expressionall of that over,or I should say the derivative of the numerator expressiontimes the denominator expression,minus the numerator expression times the derivativeof the denominator expression,all of that over the denominator expression squared.So this looks correct actually.It's a correct application of the the quotient rule.It looks like Tom is correctly simplifying.So the derivative of X to the one halfis one half X to the negative one half.So that looks right.Derivative of X to the fourth is four X to the third.So that looks right.All of this looks algebraically right,and let's see, when you simplify this.So let's see, X to the negative one halftimes X to the fourth is indeed X to,well that's going to be X to the.Oh this correlates.So this simplifies to that.Which looks correct, and that simplifies to that.Which looks correct.We're just using exponent properties there,and then divide everything by,let's see, oh there, everything is terms of X to 3.5.So we're going to have negative 3.5 X to 3.5,and then you use exploder problems.So actually it looks like he did everything correctly.This is the right answer.So his work is correct.He did not make any mistakes.But I do have a bone to pick.So speak with Tom,because he didn't have to apply the quotient rule here.He did all of this hairy calculusand algebra but it could have beena very simple simplificationhe could have made up here,and this is a key thing to realize.He could have said hey,you know what, this is the same thing.It's the derivative with respect to X ofX to the one half.That's what the square root of X is.Times X to the negative four power.That's what one over X to the fourth is.And so let me color code it.So that is the same thing as that,and that is the same thing as that,and you wouldn't even have to use the product rule here.You could simplify this even further.This is the same thingas the derivative with respect to Xof just, we have the same base.We can add the (mumbles) products.It's gonna be X to the negative 3., X to the negative 3.5,and so you can just use the power rule.So this is going to be equal to,bring the negative 3.5 out front.Negative 3.5 X to the,and then we just decrement this one by one.We subtract one from that.Negative 4.5 power.So as you can see.He could have gotten this answermuch much much much much much quicker,but he didn't make any mistakes.There's a little bit of a judgment errorjust immediately going forth with the quotient rulewhich gets quite hairy quite fast.

[Instructor] What I have listed here is severalof the derivative rules that we've used in previous videos.If these things look unfamiliar to you I encourage youto maybe to not watch this video because in this videowe're going to think about when do we apply these rules?What strategies and can we algebraically convertexpressions so that we can use a simpler rule?But this is a quick review, this is of course the powerrule right over here, very handy for taking derivativesof X raised to some power.It's also we can use that with the derivative propertiesof sums of derivatives or differences of derivativesto take derivatives of polynomials.This right over here is the product rule.If I have an expression that I want to take the derivativeof and I can think of it as the product of two functions,well then the derivative is going to be the derivativeof the first function times the second function plusthe first function times the derivative of the second.Once again if this looks completely unfamiliar to youor you're a little shaky, go watch the videos,do the practice on the power rule and the product rule,or in this case the quotient rule.And the quotient rule is a little bit more involvedand we have practicing videos on that and I always havemixed feelings about it because if you don't rememberthe quotient rule, you can usually or you can always converta quotient into a product by expressing this thingat the bottom as F of X times G of X to the negative one.So you could take the derivative with a combinationof the products and this fourth rule over here,the chain rule.And if any of this is looking unfamiliar again don't watchthis video, this video is for folks who are familiarwith each of these derivative rules or derivativetechniques and now want to think about well what arestrategies for deciding when to apply which.So let's do that.Let's say that I have the expression, let's say I'minterested in taking the derivative of X squared plus Xminus two over X minus one.Which of these rules or techniques would you use?Well you might immediately say hey look this looks likea rational expression, I could say this is my F of Xright over here, I could say this is my G of X rightover here and I could apply the quotient rule,this looks like a quotient of two expressions.And you could do that and if you do all the mathematicscorrectly, you will get the correct answer.But in this case it's good to just take a little timeto realize well can I simplify this algebraically somaybe I can do a little bit less work?And if you look at it that way, you might realizewait what if I factored this numerator I can factor itas X plus two times X minus one.And then I could cancel these two characters out and I cansay hey you know what this is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to X of X plus two.Derivative with respect to X of X plus two, which is muchmuch much much more straightforward than trying to applythe quotient rule.Here you would just take the derivative with respectto X of X which is just going to be one and the derivativewith respect to X of two is just going to be zeroand so all of this is going to simplify to one.If we're taking the derivative of that, you're essentiallyjust using the power rule.And so once again just a simple algebraic recognitionthings become much more simple.Let's do another example.So let's say that you were to see, or someone were to askyou to take the derivative with respect to X of,let me see, so let's say you had X squared plus two Xminus five over X.So once again you might be tempted to use the quotientrule, this looks like the quotient of two expressions.But then you might realize there's some algebraicmanipulations I could do to make this simpler.You could express this as a product, you could say thatthis is the same thing as, and I'm just going to focus onwhat's inside the parentheses or inside the brackets,this is the same thing as X to the negative one times Xsquared plus 2x minus five and then you might want toapply the product rule.But there's even a better simplification here.You could just divide each of these terms by X or one wayto think about it distribute this one over X acrossall the terms, X to the negative one is the same thingas one over X and if you do that X squared divided by Xis going to be X.2x divided by X is going to be two and then negative fivedivided by X, well you could write that as negative fiveover X or negative five X to the negative one.And now I'm taking the derivative of this with respectto X is much easier than using either the quotientor the power rule.This is going to be, let's see the derivative of thatis going to be one, derivative of two is going to be zeroand here even though you have a negative exponent,it might look a little intimidating, this is just takenusing the power rule.So negative one times negative five is positive fiveX to the, if we take one less than negative one we'regoing to go the negative two power.So once again making this algebraic recognition simplifiedthings a good bit.Let's do a few more examples of just starting to recognizewhen we might be able to simplify things to do thingsa little bit easier.So let's say that someone said hey you take the derivativewith respect to X and I'm using X as our variable that we'retaking the derivative of with respect to but obviouslythis works for any variables that we are using.So let's say we're saying square root of X over X squared.Pause this video and think about how would you approachthis if you want to take the derivative with respect to Xof the square root of X over X squared.Well once again you might say this is a quotient of twoexpressions, might try to apply the quotient rule,or you might recognize well look this is the same thing,let me just focus on what's inside the brackets, you couldview this as X to the negative two times the square rootof X and then you might want to use the product rulebut you could simplify this even better.You could say this is the same thing as X to the negativetwo times X to the one half power and now just using ourexponent properties, negative two plus one half is negativethree halves, so this is the derivative X to the negativethree halves power.And so here once again we took something that we thoughtwe might have to use the quotient rule or use the productrule and now this just becomes a straightforward usingthe power rule.So this is just going to be equal to, so bring the negativethree halves out front, negative three halves,X to the negative three halves minus one is negative fivehalves power.So once again just before you, especially if you're aboutto apply the quotient rule and sometimes even the productrule, just see is there an algebraic simplification,sometimes a trigonometric simplification that you can makethat eases your job that makes things less hairy?As a general tip I can't say this is going to be alwaystrue but if you're taking some type of exam and you're goingdown some really hairy route which the quotient rulewill often take you, it's a good sign that hey take a pausebefore trying to run through all of that algebrato apply the quotient rule and see if you cansimplify things.So let's give another example.In this one there's not an obvious way and it reallydepends on what folks' preferences are, but let's say youwant to take the derivative with respect to X of oneover 2x to the negative five, sorry, one over 2x minus fiveI should say.Well here you could immediately apply the quotient rule herethe numerator you view that as F of X.You could view this as the same thing as the derivativewith respect to X.Instead of 2x minus five, let me do that in the blue color.2x minus five to the negative one power.In this situation, you would use a combination of the powerrule and the chain rule.You would say okay my G of X is 2x minus five and F of Gof X is going to be this whole expression.And so if you applied the chain rule, this is going to bethe derivative of the outside function, our F of Xwith respect to the inside function.The derivative of F of G of X with respect to G of X.So it's going to be negative, we'll bring that negativeout front, so we're essentially just going to usethe power rule here.Negative 2x minus five to the negative two and then wemultiply that times the derivative of the inside function.So the inside function's derivative, the derivativeof 2x is two, the derivative of negative five is zeroso it's going to be times two and of course you can simplifyso it's a negative two times all of this business.Let me do one more example here just to hit the point homeand once again there isn't a must way, there isn't a waythat you have to do this, but just let you appreciatethat there's multiple ways to approach these typesof derivatives.So let's say someone said take the derivative of 2xplus one squared.Pause the video and think about how you would do that.Well one way to do it is just to apply the chain rulejust like we just did.So you could say alright here's going to be the derivativeof the outside with respect to the inside.So it's going to be two times 2x plus one to the firstpower, taking one less than that times the derivativeof the inside which is just going to be two and so thisis going to be equal to four times 2x plus one,which is equal to, if we want to distribute the four,we could say it's 8x plus four.That's a completely legitimate way of doing it.Now there are other ways of doing it.You could expand out to X plus one squared.You could say hey this is the same thing as the derivativewith respect to X of 2x squared is going to be 4x squaredand then two times the product of these terms is goingto be plus 4x plus one.And now you would just apply the power rule.It's a little bit of extra algebra up front but you canjust go straightforward with the power rule and you'regoing to get this exact same thing.So the whole takeaway here is pause look at your expression.See if there's a way to simplify it and it's especiallya good thing if you can get out of using the quotient rule'cause that sometimes is just hard to know or rememberand even when you do remember it, it can get quite hairyquite fast.

[Instructor] So I have two different expressions herethat I wanna take the derivative of.And what I want you to do is pause the videoand think about how you would first approachtaking the derivative of this expressionand how that might be the same or differentas your approach in taking the derivativeof this expression.The goal here isn't to compute the derivatives all the way,but really to just think about how we identifywhat strategies to use.Okay so let's first tackle this one.And the key when looking at a complex expressionlike either of these is to look at the big picturestructure of the expression.So one way to think about it is,let's look at the outside rather than the inside details.So if we look at the outside here,we have the sineof something.So there's a sine of something going on herethat I'm going to circle in redor in this pink color.So that's how my brain thinks about it.From the outside I'm like okay,big picture I'm taking the sineof some stuff.I might be taking some stuff to some exponent.In this case, I'm inputting in a trigonometric expression.But if you have a situation like that,it's a good sign thatthe chain rule is in order.So let me write that down.So we would wanna use in this casethe chain rule, C.R. for chain rule.And how would we apply it?Well we would take the derivative of the outsidewith respect to this insidetimes the derivative of this insidewith respect to x.And I'm gonna write it the way that my brainsometimes thinks about it.So we can write this asthe derivativewith respect tothat something,and I'm just gonna make that pink circlefor the something rather than writing it all again,of sine of that something,sine of that something,not even thinking about what that something is just yet,times, times the derivativewith respect to xof that something.This is just an applicationof the chain rule.No matter what was here in thispink colored circle,it might have been something with square rootsand logarithms and whatever else,as long as it's being contained within the sine,I would move to this step.The derivative with respect to that somethingof sine of that somethingtimes the derivative with respect to x of the something.Now what would that be tangibly in this case?Well this first part,I will do it in orange,this first part would just be cosineof x squared plus fivetimes cosine of x.So that's that circle right over there.Let me close the cosine right over there.And then times the derivative with respect to x,times the derivative with respect to x,of all of this again,of x squared plus fivetimes cosine of x.And then I would close my brackets.And of course I wouldn't be done yet,I have more derivative taking to do.Here now I would look at the big structureof what's going on,and I have two expressions being multiplied.I don't have just onebig expression that's being an inputinto like a sine function or cosine functionor one big expression that's taken to some exponent.I have two expressions being multiplied.I have thisbeing multiplied by this.And so if I'm just multiplying two expressions,that's a pretty good clue that to compute this part,I would then use the product rule.And I could keep doing that and compute it,and I encourage you to do so,but this is more about the strategiesand how do you recognize them.But now let's go to the other example.Well this looks a lot more like this stepof the first problem than the beginningof the original problem.Here I don't have a sine of a bunch of stuffor a bunch of stuff being raised to one exponent.Here I have the product of two expressionsjust like we saw over here.We have this expressionbeing multiplied by this expression.So my brain just says okay I have two expressions,then I'm going to use the product rule.Two expressions being multiplied,I'm going to use the product rule.If it was one expression being dividedby another expression, then I would use the quotient rule.But in this case it's going to be the product rule.And so that tells methat this is going to be the derivative with respect to xof the first expression,just gonna do that with the orange circle,times the second expression,I'm gonna do that with the blue circle,plus the first expression, not taking its derivative,the first expression, timesthe derivative with respect to x of,of the second expression.Once again here,this is just the product rule.You can substitute sine of x squared plus fivewhere you see this orange circle,and you can substitute cosine of xwhere you see this blue circle.But the whole point here isn't to actually solve thisor compute this,but really to just showhow you identify the structures in these expressionsto think about well do I use the chain rule firstand then use the product rule here?Or in this case do I use the product rule first?And even once you do this,you're not going to be done.Then to compute this derivative,you're going to have to use the chain rule,and you'll keep going until you don't have any morederivatives to take.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-differentiation-using-multiple-rules/v/applying-the-chain-rule-and-product-rule	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois try to find the derivative with respect to Xof X squaredsin of X.All of that to the third power.And what's going to be interesting is that there'smultiple ways to tackle it.And I encourage you to pause the videoand see if you could work through it on your own.So there's actually multiple techniques.One path is to do the chain rule first.So I'll just say CRfor chain rule first.And so I have, I'm taking the derivative with respect to Xof something to the third power.So, if I take the derivative it would bethe derivative with respect to that something.So that would bethree times that somethingsquaredtimes the derivative with respect to Xof that something.Where the something, in this case,is X squared sin of X.X squared sinof X.This is just an application of the chain rule.Now, the second part, what would that be?The second part heredo this in another color.In orange.Well here, I would apply the product rule.I have a product of two expressions.So I would take the derivative of, let me write this down.So this is gonna be the product rule.Product rule.I would take the derivative of the first expression.So, X, derivative of X squaredis two X.Let me write a little bit to the right.This is gonna be two Xtimes the second expressionsin of X.Plus the first expression X squaredtimes the derivative of the second one.Cosin of X.That's just the product ruleas applied to this partright over here.And all of that, of course, is being multiplied bythis up front.Which actually, let me justrewrite that.So all of this I could rewrite aslet's see, this would bethree timesif I have the product raised to the second powerI could take each of them to the second powerand then take their products.So X squared squared isX to the fourth.And then sin of X squared issinsquared of X.And then all of that is being multiplied by that.And, if we want, we can algebraically simplify.We can distribute everything out.In which case, what would we get?Well let's see.Three times two is six.X to the fourth times X isX to the fifth.Sin squared of X times sin of Xis sin of Xto the third power.And then, let's see, threeso plus three, X to the fourth times X squared isX to the sixth power.And then I have sin squared of Xsin squared of Xcosin of X.So there you have it, that's one strategychain rule first, and then product rule.What would be another strategypause the video and try to think of it.Well, we could just algebraicallyuse our exponent properties first.In which case, this is going to be equal tothe derivative with respect to Xofif I'm taking X squared times sin of X to the third powerinstead I could say X to the third powerwhich is going to be X to the sixth.And then sin of X to the third power.Sin of Xto thethird power.I'm using the same exponent propertythat we used right over here to simplify this.If I have if I'm doing the product thingsto some exponent, well that's the same thingif each of them raised to the exponentand then the product of the two.Now how would we tackle this?Well, I here, I would dothe product rule first.So let's do that.So let's do the productrule.So, we're gonna takethe derivative of the first expression.So, derivative of X to the sixthis sixX to the fifth.Times the second expression.Sinto the third of X.Or, sin of X to the third power.Plus the first X to the sixthtimes the derivative of the secondand I'm just gonna write thatD DX ofsin of Xto the third power.Now, to evaluate this right over hereit does definitely make senseto use the chain rule.Usethe chain rule.And so what is this going to be?Well I have the derivative of somethingto the third power.So that's going to be threetimes that something squaredtimes the derivative of that something.So in this case, the something is sin of X.And the derivative of sin of X is cosin of X.Then I have all of this business over here.I have six X to the fifth.Sin to the thirdor sin of X to the third power.PlusX to the sixth.And if I were to just simplify this a little bitin fact, you see it very clearly.These two things are equivalent.Thisthis term is exactly equivalent to this termthe way it's written.And then this is exactly,if you multiply three times X to the sixthsin of X squaredcosin of X.So, the nice thing about mathif we're doing things that make logical sensewe should get to the same endpoint.But the point here is that there's multiple strategies.You could use a chain rule firstand then the product rule.Or you could use a product rule first,and then the chain rule.In this case, you could debate which one is faster.It looks like the one on the rightmight be a little bit faster.Butsometimesthese two are pretty close.But sometimes it'll be more clear than notwhich one is preferable.You really want to minimize the amount of hairiness,the amount the number of stepsthe chances for careless mistakes you might have.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-differentiation-using-multiple-rules/v/chain-rule-with-triple-composition	khanacademy	video	:00So now we're going to attempt to takethe derivative of the sine of the natural log of x squared.So now we have a function that's the composite of a function,that's a composite of another function.So one way you could think of it,if you set f of x as being equal to sine of x, and g of x beingthe natural log of x, and h of x equaling x squared.Then this thing right over here is the exact same thingas trying to take the derivative with respectto x of f of g of h of x.And what I want to do is kind of thinkabout how I would do it in my head,without having to write all the chain rule notation.So the way I would think about this,if I were doing this in my head, is the derivativeof this outer function of f, with respectto the level of composition directly below it.So the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x.But instead of it being a cosine of x,it's going to be cosine of whatever was inside of here.So it's going to be cosine of natural log--let me write that in that same color--cosine of natural log of x squared.I'm going to do x that same yellow color.And so you could really view this, this part what I justread over here, as f prime, this is f prime of g of h of x.This is f prime of g of h of x.If you want to keep track of things.So I just took the derivative of the outer with respectto whatever was inside of it.And now I have to take the derivativeof the inside with respect to x.But now we have another composite function.So we're going to multiply this times, we'regoing to do the chain rule again.We're going to take the derivative of ln with respectto x squared.So the derivative of ln of x is 1/x.But now we're going to have 1 over not x,but 1 over x squared.So to be clear, this part right over here is g prime of not x.If it was g prime of x, this would be 1 over x.But instead of an x, we have our h of x there.We have our x squared.So it's g prime of x squared.And then finally, we can take the derivativeof our inner function.Let me write it.So we could write this is g prime of h of x.And finally, we just have to takethe derivative of our innermost function with respect to x.So the derivative of 2x with respect to--or the derivative of x squared with respect to x is 2x.So times h prime of x.Let me make everything clear.So what we have right over here in purple,this, this, and this are the same things.One expressed concretely, one expressed abstractly.This, this, and this are the same thing,expressed concretely and abstractly.And then finally, this and this are the same thing,expressed concretely and abstractly.But then we're done.All we have to do to be done is to just simplify this.So if we just change the order in which we're multiplying,we have 2x over x squared.So I can cancel some out.So this x over x, 2x over x squaredis the same thing as 2 over x.And we're multiplying it times all of this business.So we're left with 2 over x.And this goes away.2 over x times the cosine of the natural log of x squared.So it seemed like a very daunting derivative.But we just say, OK, what's the derivative of sine of somethingwith respect to that something?Well, that's cosine of that something.And then we go in one layer, what'sthe derivative of that something?Well, in that something we have another composition.So the derivative of ln of x, or ln of something with respectto another something, well that'sgoing to be 1 over the something.So we had gotten a 1 over x squared here,that squared got canceled out.And then finally, the derivative of this innermost function,it's kind of like peeling an onion.The derivative of this inner functionwith respect to x, which was just 2x.Which we got right over here.This was 1 over x squared.This was 2x before we did any canceling out.So hopefully that helps clear things up a little bit.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-second-derivatives/v/finding-second-derivative-implicit	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's say that we're given the equationthat y squared minus x squaredis equal to four.And our goal is to find the second derivative of ywith respect to x, and we want tofind an expression for it in terms of x's and y's.So pause this video, and see if you can work through this.All right, now let's do it together.Now, some of you might have wanted to solve for yand then use some traditional techniques.But here, we have a y squared,and so it might involve a plus or a minus square root.And so some of y'all might have realized, hey,we can do a little bit of implicit differentiation,which is really just an application of the chain rule.So let's do that.Let's first find the first derivativeof y with respect to x.And to do that, I'll just take the derivativewith respect to x of both sides of this equation.And then what do we get?Well, the derivative with respect to x of y squared,we're gonna use the chain rule here.First, we can take the derivativeof y squared with respect to y,which is going to be equal to two y,and then that times the derivative of y with respect to x.Once again, this comes straight out of the chain rule.And then, from that, we will subtract,what's the derivative of x squared with respect to x?Well, that's just going to be two x.And then last, but not least,what is the derivative of a constant with respect to x?Well, it doesn't change,so it's just going to be equal to zero.All right, now we can solve forour first derivative of y with respect to x.Let's do that.We can add two x to both sides,and we would get two y times the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal totwo x.And now I can divide both sides by two y, and I am goingto getthat the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal to x,x over y.Now, the next step is let's take the derivativeof both sides of this with respect to x,and then we can hopefully find our second derivativeof y with respect to x.And to help us there, actually let me rewrite this.And I always forget the quotient rule,although it might be a useful thing for you to remember.But I could rewrite this as a product,which will help me at least.So I'm going to rewrite this as the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal tox times y to the negative one power,y to the negative one power.And now, if we want to find the second derivative,we apply the derivative operatoron both sides of this equation,derivative with respect to x.And our left-hand side is exactlywhat we eventually wanted to get,so the second derivative of y with respect to x.And what do we get here on the right-hand side?Well, we can apply the product rule.So first, we can say the derivative of x with respect to x,well, that is just going to be one times the other thing,so times y to the negative one power,y to the negative one power.And then we have plusx times the derivative of y to the negative one.So plus x,what's the, times,what's the derivative of y to the negative one power?Well, first, we can find the derivativeof y to the negative one power with respect to y.We'll just leverage the power rule there.So that's going to be negative onetimes y to the negative two power.And then we would multiply thattimes the derivative of y with respect to x,just an application of the chain rule,times dy/dx.And remember, we know what the derivativeof y with respect to x is.We already solved for that.It is x over y.So this over here is going to be x over y.And so now we just have to simplify this expression.This is going to be equal to,and I'll try to do it part by part,that part right over there is just going to be a one over y.And then all of this business,let's see if I can simplify that.This negative is going to go out front, so minus,and then I'm going to have x times x in the numerator.And then it's going to be divided by y squaredand then divided by another y.So it's going to be minus x squaredover y to the third,over y to the third, or another way to think about it,x squared times y to the negative three.And we are done.We have just figured out the second derivative of ywith respect to xin terms of x's and y's.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-second-derivatives/v/evaluating-second-derivative-implicit	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So we have a question herefrom the 2015 AP Calculus AB test,and it says consider the curve given by the equationy to the third minus x y is equal to two.It can be shown that the first derivative of ywith respect to x is equal to that.So they solve that for us.And then part c of it, I skipped parts a and bfor the sake of this video.Evaluate the second derivative of y with respect to xat the point on the curve where x equal negative oneand y is equal to one.So pause this video and see if you can do that.All right now let's do it together.And so let me just first write down the first derivative.So dy, derivative of y,with respect to x is equal toy overthree y squared minus x.Well if we're concerning ourselveswith the second derivative,well then we wanna take the derivative with respect to xof both sides of this.So let's just do that.Do the derivative operatoron both sides right over here.Now on the left hand side,we of course are going to get the second derivative of y,with respect to x.But what do we get on the right hand side?And there's multiple ways to approach this.But for something like this,the quotient rule probably is the best way to tackle it.I sometimes complain about the quotient rulesaying hey, it's just a variation of the product rule.But it's actually quite useful in something like this.We just have to remind ourselvesthat this is going to be equal tothe derivative of the numeratorwith respect to x.And so that's just going to be derivative of ywith respect to xtimes the denominator,three y squared minus xMinus the numerator, y,times the derivative of the denominator with respect to x.Well, what's the derivativeof this denominator with respect to x?Well the derivative of three y squared with respect to xthat's going to be the derivative of three y squaredwith respect to y,which is just going to be six y.I'm just using the power rule there.Times the derivative of y with respect to x.All I did just now is I took the derivative of thatwith respect to x.Which is derivative of that with respect to ytimes the derivative of y with respect to x.Comes straight out of the chain rule.Minus the derivative of this with respect to x,which is just going to be equal to one.All of that over, remember,we're in the middle of the quotient rule right over here.All of that overthe denominator squared.All of that over three y squared minus x, squared.Now lucky for us,they want us to evaluate this at a point,as opposed to have to do a bunchof algebraic simplification here.So we can say,when,let me do it over here.So when, I'll it right here.Whenx is equal to negative one,and y is equal to one,well first of all, what's the,what's dy dx going to be?The derivative of y with respect to x,let me scroll down a little bit,so we have a little bit more space.The derivative of y with respect to xis going to be equal to one over three times one squared,which is just three,minus negative one.So that's just going be plus one.It's going to be equal to 1/4.And so this whole expression over here,so I can write the second derivative of y with respect to xis going to be equal to,well we know that that's going to be equal to 1/4.1/4 times three times one squared,which is just three,minus negative one,so plus one,minus one,so I'll just leave that minus out there,times six times one,times 1/4.Let me just write it out.Six, six times onetimes 1/4minus oneall of that overlet's see this is going to bethree times y squared,y is one, so is just gonna be three,three minus negative one,so plus one,squared.Now what is this going to be?And this is just simplifying something here.1/4 times fourthat's going to simplify to one.And let's see, this is going to be 1 1/2 minus oneso that's going to be 1/2.And then we're going to be have all of that over 16.And so this is going to be equal to,we get a mini drum roll here,this is going to be equal to one minus 1/2,which is equal to 1/2.Over 16,which is the same thing as one over 32.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-disguised-derivatives/v/disguised-derivatives	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can find the limitas h approaches zero of five log of two plus hminus five log of two,all of that over h.And I'll give you a little bit of a hintbecause I know you're about to pause the videoand try to work through it.Think of your derivative properties,especially the derivatives of logarithmic functions,especially logarithmic functions in this casewith a base 10.If someone just writes log without the base,you can just assume that that is a 10 right over there.So pause the video, and see if you can work through it.Alright, so the key here is to remember that ifI have, if I have f of x,let me do it over here,I'll do it over here.F of xand I want to findf prime of,let's say f prime of some number,let's say a,this is going to be equal tothe limit as x, or sorry,as h approaches zero is one way of thinking about it,as h approaches zero of f of a plus h,minus f of a,all of that over h.So this looks pretty close to that limit definition,except we have these fives here.But lucky for us we can factor out those fives,and we could factor them out,we could factor them out out front here,but if you just have a scale or times the expression,we know from our limit propertieswe can actually take those out of the limit themselves.So let's do that,let's take both of these fives,and factor them out,and so this whole thing is going to simplify tofive times the limitas h approaches zero of log of two plus h,minus, minus log of two,all of that over h.Now, you might recognize what we have in yellow here,cause think about it,what this is,if we had f of x is equal tolog of x,and we wanted to know what f prime of,well actually let's say f prime of two is,well this would be the limitas h approaches zero of log oftwo plus h,two plus h,minus log of two,minus log of two,all of that over h.So this is really just a,what we see there,this by definitionthis right over here is,is f prime of two.If f of x is log of x,this is f prime of two,f prime of two.So can we figure that out?If f of x is log of x,what is f prime of x?F prime of x, we don't need to use the limit definition.In fact the limit definition is quitehard to evaluate this limit,but we know how to take the derivativeof logarithmic functions.So f prime of xis going to be equal toone over the natural log of our base,our base here we already talked about that,that is 10.So one over natural log of 10,times,times, times x.If this was a natural log,well, then, this would be one overnatural log of e times x,natural log of e is just one,so that's where you get the one over x,but if you have any other baseyou put the natural log of that baseright over here in the denominator.So what is f prime of two?F prime of two isone over the natural log of 10,times two.So this whole thing has simplified,this whole thing is equal to five times this business.So I could actually just write it asit's equal to five over,five over the natural log of 10,natural log of 10,times two,I could have written it as two natural log of 10s.The key here for this type of exercise,you might be a little let me seeif I can evaluate this limit?You're like whoa, this looks a lot like the derivativeof a logarithmic function,especially the derivative when x is equal to two,if we could just factor these fives out.So you factor out the fives,and say hey, this is, this is the derivativeof log of x when x is equal to two,and so we know how to take the derivative of log of x.If you don't know we have videos where we prove this.Where you take the derivatives of logarithmswith bases other than e,and you just use that to actuallyand you find the derivative,and you evaluate it at two,and then you're done!
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-logarithmic-differentiation/v/calculus-derivative-of-x-x-x	khanacademy	video	:00A bit of a classic implicit differentiation problemis the problem y is equal to x to the x.And then to find out what the derivative of yis with respect to x.And people look at that, oh you know, I don't have just aconstant exponent here, so I can't just use the powerrules, how do you do it.And the trick here is really just to take the natural log ofboth sides of this equation.And this is going to build up to what we're going todo later in this video.So If you take the natural log on both sides of this equation,you get the natural log of y is equal to the naturallog of x to the x.Now our power rules, or I guess our natural log rules, saylook, if I'm taking the natural log of something to thesomething, this is equivalent to, I can rewrite the naturallog of x to the x as being equal to x times thenatural log of x.So let me rewrite everything again.If I take the natural log of both sides of that equation, Iget the natural log of y is equal to x times thenatural log of x.And now we can take the derivative of both sides ofthis with respect to x.So the derivative with respect to x of that, and thenthe derivative with respect to x of that.Now we're going to apply a little bit of the chain rule.So the chain rule.What's the derivative of this with respect to x?What's the derivative of our inner expressionwith respect to x?It's a little implicit differentiation, so it's dywith respect to x times the derivative of this wholething with respect to this inner function.So the derivative of natural log of x is 1/x.So the derivative of natural log of y withrespect to y is 1/y.So times 1/y.And the derivative of this-- this is just the product rule,and I'll arbitrarily switch colors here-- is the derivativeof the first term, which is 1, times the second term, so timesthe natural log of x plus the derivative of the second term,which is 1/x times the first term.So times x.And so we get dy/dx times 1/y is equal to natural log of xplus-- this just turns out to be 1-- x divided by x, andthen you multiply both sides of this by y.You get dy/dx is equal to y times the naturallog of x plus 1.And if you don't like this y sitting here, you could justmake the substitution.y is equal to x to the x.So you could say that the derivative of y with respect tox is equal to x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.And that's a fun problem, and this is often kind of given asa trick problem, or sometimes even a bonus problem if peopledon't know to take the natural log of both sides of that.But I was given an even more difficult problem, andthat's what we're going to tackle in this.But it's good to see this problem done first because itgives us the basic tools.So the more difficult problem we're going todeal with is this one.Let me write it down.So the problem is y is equal to x to the-- and here's thetwist-- x to the x to the x.And we want to find out dy/dx.We want to find out the derivative of ywith respect to x.So to solve this problem we essentially use the same tools.We use the natural log to essentially breakdown thisexponent and get it into terms that we can deal with.So we can use the product rule.So let's take the natural log of both sides of this equationlike we did last time.You get the natural log of y is equal to the natural logof x to the x to the x.And this is just the exponent on this.So we can rewrite this as x to the x times the natural logtimes the natural log of x.So now our expression our equation is simplified to thenatural log of y is equal to x to the x times thenatural log of x.But we still have this nasty x to the x here.We know no easy way to take the derivative there, although I'veactually just shown you what the derivative of this is, sowe could actually just apply it right now.I was going to take the natural log again and it would turninto this big, messy, confusing thing but I realized thatearlier in this video I just solved for what thederivative of x to the x is.It's this thing right here.It's this crazy expression right here.So we just have to remember that and then apply andthen do our problem.So let's do our problem.And if we hadn't solved this ahead of time, it was kind ofan unexpected benefit of doing the simpler version of theproblem, you could just keep taking the natural log of this,but it'll just get a little bit messier.But since we already know what the derivative of x to thex is, let's just apply it.So we're going to take the derivative of bothsides of the equation.Derivative of this is equal to the derivative of this.We'll ignore this for now.Derivative of this with respect to x is the derivative ofthe natural log of y with respect to y.So that's 1/y times the derivative of ywith respect to x.That's just the chain rule.We learned that in implicit differentiation.And so this is equal to the derivative of the first termtimes the second term, and I'm going to write it out here justbecause I don't want to skip steps and confuse people.So this is equal to the derivative with respect to x ofx to the x times the natural log of x plus the derivativewith respect to x of the natural log ofx times x to the x.So let's focus on the right hand side of this equation.What is the derivative of x to the x with respect to x?Well we just solved that problem right here.It's x to the x natural log of x plus 1.So this piece right there-- I already forgot what itwas-- it was x to the x natural log of x plus 1.That is x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.And then we're going to multiply that timesthe natural log of x.And then we're going to add that to, plus the derivativeof the natural log of x.That's fairly straightforward, that's 1/x times x to the x.And of course the left hand side of the equationwas just 1/y dy/dx.And we can multiply both sides of this now by y, and we getdy/dx is equal to y times all of this crazy stuff-- x to thex times the natural log of x plus 1 times the natural log ofx plus 1/x times x to the x.That's x to the negative 1.We could rewrite this as x to the minus 1, and thenyou add the exponents.You could write this as x to the x minus 1 power.And if we don't like this y here, we can justsubstitute it back.y was equal to this, this crazy thing right there.So our final answer for this seemingly-- well on one levellooks like a very simple problem, but on another levelwhen you appreciate what it's saying, it's like oh there's avery complicated problem-- you get the derivative of y withrespect to x is equal to y, which is this.So that's x to the x to the x times all of this stuff-- timesx to the x natural log of x plus 1 times the natural logof x, and then all of that plus x to the x minus 1.So who would have thought.Sometimes math is elegant.You take the derivative of something like this andyou get something neat.For example, when you take the derivative of naturallog of x you get 1/x.That's very simple and elegant, and it's nice that mathworked out that way.But sometimes you do something, you take an operation onsomething that looks pretty simple and elegant, and you getsomething that's hairy and not that pleasant to lookat, but is a pretty interesting problem.And there you go.

[Voiceover] Let's say y is equal tothe natural log of x to the xth power,and what we wanna do, we wanna findthe derivative of y with respect to x.So I encourage you to pause this videoand see if you can do it.So, when you first try to tackle this,this is a little bit daunting.We know how to take the derivative of constantsto some x power, but how do we take a derivativeof some time of a function, in this case,a natural log, to the xth power?And the answer here is to use some ofour logarithmic properties, and then we're going to doa little bit of implicit differentiation.So the first thing that we wanna do,actually, let me rewrite this with a little bit of space,so, this was a natural log of x to the xth power.So the first thing, I wanna get rid of this xas an exponential, and I wanna be ableto apply the product rule somehow.The way we're gonna do that is by takingthe natural log of both sides.So take the natural log of both sides,and you might say, well, why is that helpful?Well, if I'm taking the natural logof something to an exponent, well, this is the same thing,actually, let me write this downas a property that you may or may not rememberfrom your logarithmic properties,so if I have, I could write log,or I'll just write natural log,of, if I have natural log of a to the b power,this is the same thing as b times the natural log of a.It's just a standard logarithmic property.And so, by taking the natural log of both sides,this exponent can now become out frontand scale the natural log function.So this exponent now, we can bring that out front,and let's just rewrite everything.So we get the natural log of yis equal to, so then let me put that in parentheses,so it's the natural log of y,is equal to x, that x is in blue,x times the natural log times the natural log, of, sorry,x times the natural log of the natural log of x.The natural log of the natural log of x.So, there you have it.By just taking the natural log of both sidesand using this logarithmic property,we were able to get that.Now you're saying, well, gee,how is this actually going to be useful for us?Well now, we can implicitly takethe derivative of both sides of this.And actually, let me scoot this overto the right a little bit, just so that we can,I have space for my derivative operator.So there you go, scooted that over.And so now, let's take the derivativewith respect to x of both sides.So let me, so I'm gonna take the derivativewith respect to x of the left-hand sideand of the right-hand side,and of the right-hand side.Now, on the left-hand side, this is going to be,essentially, an application of the chain rule.When you learn implicit differentiation,it's really just application of the chain rule.It's the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to to the inside function,so the natural log of y with respect to y,the derivative of that is just going to be one over y,one over y times the derivative ofthe inside function with respect to x.So dy dx, dy dx.That is going to be equal to,well this is going to get interesting a little bit.Actually, let me do some stuff on the side a little bit.Let me just, the first thing we wanna do hereis just apply the product rule.So it's the derivative of the first expression,so it's just going to be 1 times the second,I guess you'd say, function,so times the natural log of the natural log of x,natural log of x, and thenplus the first function, just x,times the derivative of the second function.Times the derivative of the second function.What's the derivative of the natural logof the natural log of x?Let's do that separately.So if I have, if I'm trying to take the derivative,with respect to to x, of the natural log,the natural log of the natural log of x,of the natural log of x,well, here, again, I can apply the chain rule.The derivative of that magenta functionwith respect to the inside function,that is going to be one over the natural log of x,and then times the derivative of the inside functionwith respect to x, so times one over x.So this is equal to one over x natural log of x.So the derivative of this second function right over hereis one over x natural log of x,one over x natural log of x.Let's see, that x and that x cancels out,and so we are left with, we are left with one over y,and I'll just write all of this in this blue color,so one over y times the derivative of ywith respect to x, is equal to,see this is just the natural log of the natural log of x,the natural log of the natural log of x,plus one over the natural log of x,one over the natural log of x.And now, to solve for the derivative,we can multiply both sides by y, so let's do that.So we're gonna multiply that side by y,and we're gonna multiply this side times y,and what are we going to get?Well, on the left-hand side, that's why we multiplied by y,we just have the derivative y with respect to x,derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to, well, y is our original,is all this, is our original thing that we had.Y was equal to the natural log,let me rewrite it over here.Y was equal to the natural log of x to the xth power.So this is, we're essentially multiplying both sidestimes the natural log of x to the xth power.So this gonna get a little bit, a little bit messy here.So we could just write it the way I wrote it just now,without it being distributed,actually, let me just leave it like that.So it's going to be, and so we deservea drum roll right now, 'cause this is quite involved,the natural log of the natural log of xplus one over the natural log of x,all of that times the natural log of x to the xth power.So that was quite involved.And if someone said well, what is the derivative of ywhen x is equal to e?So if someone says what is this equal towhen x is equal to e, well, we could evaluate thiswhen x is equal to e.This would be the, and I just made that up just now,so if like the original question wasn't justwhat is dy dx, if they saidwhat is dy dx when x is equal to e.If that was the original question,then we could evaluate it.So where we just replace all these with e's,so it'd be an e there, an e there, an e there,and an e there, and I just picked the value e'cause it's easy to evaluate.So that natural log of e is 1,natural log of 1 e to the zeroth power is 1,so all of that just becomes 0.The natural log of e is 1,so this whole expression right over herebecomes zero plus one over one,so this becomes one, and thenthe natural log of e is, the natural log of e is one,and you're gonna have one to the eth power,well you could raise one to any power,and you're just get one.So it's one times one is equal to one.So I just thought it would be funto try to evaluate that at a valuethat would be somewhat clean.

result that I hope to show you,or you give you an intuition for, in this videois something that we will usein the proof of the chain rule,or in a proof of the chain rule actually.We may do more than proof of the chain rule.But the result we're gonna look atis if we have some function uwhich is a function of x,and we know that it is continuousat x equals c,so if we know this, then that's going to implythat the change in u goesto zero as our change in x in this regionaround c goes to zero.This is what I want to get an intuition for.That if u is continuous at c,then as our change in x around cgets smaller, and smaller, and smalleras it approaches zero, then our change in uapproaches zero as well.To think about this, or to even kind of prove itto ourselves a little bit more rigorously,let's think about what it meansto be continuous at x equals c.Well the definition of continuity is,so this literally is the same thing as sayingthat the limit as x approaches cof u of x is equal to u of c.The limit that our function approachesas x approaches c is equalto the value of the function at c.We don't have a point discontinuityor a jump discontinuity.If we had a jump discontinuity,then the limit wouldn't exist,and we've seen that in previous videos.Now I'm just gonna manipulate this algebraicallyso it essentially gives us this conclusionright over here.So this we can rewrite.It's important to realize that u of c,this is just going to be some value.It looks like maybe this is a functionof x or something, but no,this is just going to be some value.I've inputted c here and I've evaluatedthe function of that, and so this is goingto be some number.It could be five, or seven, or pi,or negative one, but it's just goingto be some value, some constant.So I can treat it like a constant.So this is going to be the same thingas saying the limit as xapproaches c of u of xminus u of cis equal to zero.And actually, in the video where we provethat differentiability implies continuity,we started with this and we provedthat right over there.We show that these two are equivalent things.But hopefully you could even thinkabout the intuition.This is just if the limit of u of xis x approaches c is equal to this,then when you evaluate this limit,the limit is x approaches c,well this thing is going to approach u of c,because we saw it right up here,u of c minus u of c is indeedgoing to be equal to zero.So hopefully you don't feel like it's too muchof a stretch, and you can just subtractu of c from both sides and apply propertiesof limits, and you can get this result as well.But this is interesting because this essentiallycan take us to this,the idea that as our change in xgets smaller, and smaller, and smalleras it approaches zero, then our changein our function is also going to approach zero.Now let's just graph this or visualize thisto get a sense of that.So this is our x axis.Woops.That's our x axis.Let's call that our u axis maybe.And I did u intentionally becausethat's the variable we'll usein our proof of the chain rule video.Let's say this right over hereis our function.Let's say this right over here,that is c.This right over here is u of c.U of c.Then let's just take some arbitrary x over here.So some arbitrary x,and then this right over here is u of x.So if we define our change,let me do this.If we define our change in u is equalto u of x minus u of c,which makes sense because thisis our change in u.So let's say this is going to be u of xminus u of c.If we define our change in xis equal to x minus c,which it is in this case,it is x minus c,then we can rewrite this limitright over here.Instead of saying the limit as x approaches c,we could write the limit as delta xapproaches zero, because if x approaches c,then delta x is going to approach zero.So we could write this the limitas delta x approaches zero of delta uis going to be equal to zero.We define this as our change in u,and it is our change in u.So this is equal to zero.So another way of thinking about thisis as delta x approaches zero,our change in u, our change in the function,is going to approach zero.So as delta x approaches zero,delta u approaches zero.That's what we wrote over here.Delta u approaches zeroas delta x approaches zero.In a lot of ways, this is hopefully common sense.We're dealing with a continuous function.As you get smaller and smaller,and you can just think of it this way,as you get smaller and smaller changes in x's,as our change in x gets smaller,and smaller, and smaller, and smaller,well it's because it's continuous.You wouldn't be able to say thisfor a discontinuous function,but because it's continuous,or you wouldn't be able to say thisfor some discontinuous functions,as our change in x gets smaller,and smaller, and smaller,then our change in u is going to get smaller,and smaller, and smaller.So it makes intuitive sense,but hopefully this makes you feeleven better about it because we're going to usethis idea to prove the chain rulein the next video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-proof-videos-2/v/chain-rule-proof	khanacademy	video	":00- What I hope to do in this videois a proof of the famous and usefuland somewhat elegant and sometimes infamous chain rule.And, if you've been following some of the videoson ""differentiability implies continuity"",and what happens to a continuous functionas our change in x, if x is our independent variable,as that approaches zero, how the changein our function approaches zero,then this proof is actually surprisingly straightforward,so let's just get to it, and this is justone of many proofs of the chain rule.So the chain rule tells us that ify is a function of u,which is a function of x,and we want to figure out the derivative of this,so we want to differentiate this with respect to x,so we're gonna differentiate this with respect to x,we could write this as the derivativeof y with respect to x,which is going to be equal to the derivativeof y with respect to u,times the derivative of u with respect to x.This is what the chain rule tells us.But how do we actually go about proving it?Well we just have to remind ourselvesthat the derivative of y with respect to x...the derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to the limit as delta x approaches zeroof change in y over change in x.Now we can do a little bit of algebraic manipulation hereto introduce a change in u, so let's do that.So this is going to be the same thing asthe limit as delta x approaches zero,and I'm gonna rewrite this part right over here.I'm gonna essentially divide and multiplyby a change in u.So I could rewrite this as delta yover delta utimes delta u, whoops...times delta u over delta x.Change in y over change in u,times change in u over change in x.And you can see, these are just going to be numbers here,so our change in u, this would cancel with that,and you'd be left with change in y over change x,which is exactly what we had here.So nothing earth-shattering just yet.But what's this going to be equal to?What's this going to be equal to?Well the limit of the productis the same thing as the product of the limit,so this is going to be the same thing asthe limit as delta xapproaches zero of, and I'll color-coat it,of this stuff, of delta yover delta u, times--maybe I'll put parentheses around it,times the limit...the limit as delta x approaches zero,delta x approaches zero,of this business.So let me put some parentheses around it.Delta u over delta x.So what does this simplify to?Well this right over here, this is the definition,and if we're assuming, in order for this to even be true,we have to assume that u and yare differentiable at x.So we assume, in order for this to be true,we're assuming...we're assuming y comma u are differentiable...are differentiable at x.And remember also, if they're differentiable at x,that means they're continuous at x.But if u is differentiable at x,then this limit exists, and this is the derivative of...this is u prime of x, or du/dx,so this right over here...we can rewrite as du/dx,I think you see where this is going.Now this right over here,just looking at it the way it's written out right here,we can't quite yet call this dy/du,because this is the limit as delta x approaches zero,not the limit as delta u approaches zero.But we just have to remind ourselvesthe results from, probably, the previous videodepending on how you're watching it,which is, if we have a function uthat is continuous at a point,that, as delta x approaches zero,delta u approaches zero.So we can actually rewrite this...we can rewrite this right over here,instead of saying delta x approaches zero,that's just going to have the effect,because u is differentiable at x,which means it's continuous at x,that means that delta u is going to approach zero.As our change in x gets smaller and smaller and smaller,our change in u is going to getsmaller and smaller and smaller.So we can rewrite this,as our change in u approaches zero,and when we rewrite it like that,well then this is just dy/du.This is just dy, the derivative of y, with respect to u.So just like that, if we assumey and u are differentiable at x,or you could say that y is a function of u,which is a function of x,we've just shown, in fairly simple algebra here,and using some assumptions aboutdifferentiability and continuity,that it is indeed the casethat the derivative of y with respect to xis equal to the derivative of y with respect to utimes the derivative of u with respect to x.Hopefully you find that convincing."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-meaning-of-the-derivative-in-context/v/interpreting-the-meaning-of-the-derivative-in-context	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We are told that Eddiedrove from New York City to Philadelphia.The function d gives thetotal distance Eddie has drivenin kilometers t hours after he left.What is the best interpretation for the following statement?D prime of two is equal to 100.So pause this video, and I encourage you to write it out.What do you think this means,and be sure to include the appropriate units.And now let's do this together.If d is equal to the distance,the distance driven, then to get d prime,you're taking the derivative with respect to time.So one way to think about it is,it is the rate of change of d.So we could view this as d prime isgoing to give you the instantaneous,instantaneous, instantaneous rate.And they are both functions of t.So one way to view d prime of two is equal to 100,that would mean, well, what is our time now?Well, that is our t, and that's in hours.So two hours, actually let me color code it.So two hours after leaving,after leaving, Eddie,Eddie, drove, drove,and this means, so it'll be grammatically correct.Drove at an instantaneous,instantaneous, instantaneous rate of,and let me use a different color now for this part,of 100, and what are the units?Well, the distance was given in kilometers,and now we're gonna be thinkingabout kilometers per unit time.Kilometers per hour, so this is 100 kilometers,kilometers, per hour.So that's the interpretation there.Let's do another example.Here we are told a tank is being drained of water.The function v gives the volume of liquid in the tank,in liters, after t minutes.What is the best interpretation for the following statement?The slope of the line tangent to the graphof v at t equals seven is equal to negative three.So pause this video againand try to do what we just did with the previous example.Write out that interpretation,make sure to get the units right.All right, so let's just remind ourselves what's going on.V is going to give us the volume, as a function of time.Volume is in liters, and time is in minutes.And so they're talking about the slopeof the tangent line to the graph,the slope of the tangent line to the graph of v,that's just v prime.So if you take the derivative with respect to time,that's going to give you v prime,and these are all functions of t.These are all functions of t.And they say at t equals seven,it's equal to negative three.So this, which is the same thing as the slopeof tangent line, slope of tangent, tangent line.And they tell us that v primeof at time equals seven minutes,our rate of change of volume with respectto time is equal to negative three.And so you could say if we were to write out,this means that after,after seven minutes, seven minutes,the tank is being drained at an instantaneous,instantaneous, that's why we needthat calculus for that instantaneous rate.An instantaneous rate of,now you might be temptedto say it's being drained at an instantaneous rateof negative three liters per minute.But remember, the negative three just showsthat the volume is decreasing.So one way to think about itis this negative is already being accountedfor when you're saying it's being drained.If this was positive, that means it is being filled.So it is being drained at an instantaneous rateof three liters per minute.Three liters per minute.And how did I know the units were liters per minute?Well, the volume function is in terms of liters,and the time is in terms of minutes.And then I'm taking the derivative with respect to time,so now it's gonna be liters per minute, and we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-straight-line-motion/v/one-dimensional-motion-with-calculus	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] What we're going to doin this video is start to think abouthow we describe position in one dimensionas a function of time.So we could say our position,and we're gonna think about positionon the x-axis as a function of time.And we could define it by some expression,let's say, in this situation,it is going to be our time to the third powerminus three times our time squared plus five.And this is going to applyfor our time being non-negative'cause the idea of negative time,at least for now, is a bit strange.So let's think about what thisright over here is describing.And to help us do that,we could set up a little bit of a tableto understand that depending on what time we are,let's say that time is in seconds,what is going to be our position along our x-axis?So at time equals zero, x of zero is just going to be five.At time one, you're gonna have one minus three plus five.So that is going to be,let's see, one minus three is negative two,plus five is going to be,we're going to be at position three.And then at time two, we are going to beat eight minus 12 plus five,so we're going to be at position one.And then at time t equals three,it's gonna be 27 minus 27 plus five,we're gonna be back at five.And so, this can at least help us understandwhat's going on for the first three seconds.So let me draw our positive x-axis.So, say it looks something like that.And this is x equals zero.This is our x-axis.X equals one, two, three, four, and five.And now let's play out how this particlethat's being described is moving along the x-axis.So we're gonna start here,and we're gonna go one, two, three.Let's do it again.We're going to go one, two, three,the way I just moved my mouse, if we assumethat I got the time roughly right,is how that particle would move.And we can graph this as well.So for example, it would look like this.We are starting at time t equals zero.Our position, this is our vertical axis, our y-axis,but we're just saying y is going to be equalto our position along the x-axis.So that's a little bit counterintuitivebecause we're talking about our positionin the left-right dimension,and here you're seeing it start offin the vertical dimension,but you see the same thing.At time t equals one, our position has gone down to three.Then it goes down further.At time equals two, our position is down to one.And then, we switch directionand then over the next, if we say that time is in seconds,over the next second, we get back to five.Now an interesting thing to think aboutin the context of calculus is,well, what is our velocity at any point in time?And velocity as you might remember,is the derivative of position.So let me write that down.So we're gonna be thinking about velocityas a function of time.And you could view velocity as the first derivativeof position with respect to timewhich is just going to be equal to,or we're gonna apply the power ruleand some derivative properties multiple times.If this is unfamiliar to you,I encourage you to review it.But this is going to be three t squaredminus six t and then plus zero,and we're gonna restrict the domain as well for tis greater than or equal to zero.And then, we can plot that.It would look like that.Now let's see if this curve makes intuitive sense.We mentioned that one second, two seconds,three seconds.So we're starting moving to the left.And the convention is if you're moving to the left,you have negative velocity,and if you're moving to the right,you have positive velocity.And you can see here our velocityimmediately gets more and more negativeuntil we get to one second,and then it stays negative but it's getting lessand less negative until we get to two seconds.And at two seconds, our velocity becomes positive.And that makes sense, because at two secondswas when our velocity switched directionsto the rightward direction.So, our velocity is getting more and more negative,less and less negative, and then we switch directionsand we go just like that.And we see it right over here.Now one thing to keep in mindwhen we're thinking about velocity as a function of timeis that velocity and speed are two different things.Speed, speed, let me write it over here.Speed is equal to, if you think about itin one dimension, you could think about itas the absolute value of your velocityas a function of time or your magnitude of velocityas a function of time.So in the beginning, even though your velocityis becoming more and more negative,your speed is actually increasing.Your speed is increasing to the left,then your speed is decreasing, you slow down,and then your speed is increasingas we go to the right.And we'll do some worked examplesthat work through that a little bit more.Now the last concept we will touch on in this videois the idea of acceleration.And acceleration you can viewas the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.So acceleration as a function of timeis just going to be the first derivativeof velocity with respect to timewhich is equal to the second derivativeof position with respect to time.It's just going to be the derivative of this expression.So once again, using the power rule here,that's going to be six t.And then using the power rule here,minus six, and once again, we will restrict the domain.And we can graph that as well.And we would see right over here,this is y is equal to acceleration as a function of time.And you can see at time equals zero,our acceleration is quite negative.It is negative six.And then it becomes less and less and less negative.And then, our acceleration actuallybecomes positive at t equals one.Now, does that makes sense?Well, we're going one, two, three.You might say, ""Wait, we didn't switch directions""until we get to the second second.""But remember, after we get to the first second,our velocity in the negative directionbecomes less negative which meansthat our acceleration is positive.If that's a little confusing,pause the video and really think through that.So, our acceleration is negative, then positive,and then positive continues.And so, this is just to give you an intuition.In the next few videos, we'll do several worked examplesthat help us dive deeper into this ideaof studying motion and position,into this idea of studying motion in one dimension."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-straight-line-motion/v/interpreting-direction-from-position-time	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] An object is moving along a line.The following graph gives the object's position,relative to its starting point, over time.For each point on the graph, is the object moving forward,backward, or neither?So pause this video and try to figure that out.All right, so we see we have position in metersversus time, so for example,this point right over here tells us that after one second,we are four meters ahead of our starting point.Or for example, this point right over heresays that after four seconds, we are almost it seems,almost four meters behind our starting point.So let's look at each of these points and think aboutwhether we're moving forward, backward, or neither.So at this point right over here,at that moment, we're about 2 1/2 meters in frontof our starting point.We're at a positive position of 2 1/2 meters.But as time goes on, we are moving backwardscloser and closer to the starting point.So this is we are moving backward.One way to think about it,at this time we're at 2 1/2 meters.If you go forward about half a second,we are then back at our starting point.So we had to go backwards.And if we look at this point right over here,it looks like we were going backwards this entire timewhile our curve is downward sloping.But at this point right over here,when we are about it looks like five metersbehind our starting point, we start going forward again.But right at that moment, we are going neitherforward nor backwards.It's right at that moment where we just finishedgoing backwards and we're about to go forward,and one way to think about it is,what would be the slope of the tangent line at that point,and the slope of the tangent line at that pointwould be horizontal.And so this is neither.So we can use that same technique to think about this point.The slope is positive.And we see that all right, right at that moment,it looks like we are at the starting point,but if you fast forward even a few,even a fraction of a second, we are now in frontof our starting point.So we are moving forward.We are moving forward right over here.And at this point, we are at our starting point,but if you think about what's going to happena moment later.A moment later we're gonna be a little bit behindour starting point, and so here we are moving backward.And we're done.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-straight-line-motion/v/motion-problems-with-derivatives	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] A particle moves along the x-axis.The function x of t gives the particle's positionat any time t is greater than or equal to zero,and they give us x of t right over here.What is the particle's velocity v of t at t is equal to two?So pause this video, see if you can figure that out.Well, the key thing to realize is that your velocityas a function of time is the derivative of position.And so this is going to be equal to,we just take the derivative with respect to t up here.So derivative of t to the thirdwith respect to t is three t squared.If that's unfamiliar,I encourage you to review the power rule.The derivative of negative four t squaredwith respect to t is negative eight t.And derivative of three t with respect to t is plus three.Derivative of a constant doesn't changewith respect to time, so that's just zero.And so here we have velocity as a function of time.And so if we want to know our velocity at time t equals two,we just substitute two wherever we see the t's.So it's gonna be three times four,three times two squared,so it's 12 minus eight times two, minus 16,plus three, which is equal to negative one.And you might say negative oneby itself doesn't sound like a velocity.Well, if they gave us units, if they told usthat x was in meters and that t was in seconds,well, then x would be,well, I already said would be in meters,and velocity would be negative one meters per second.You might also be saying,well, what does the negative means?Well, that means that we are moving to the left.Remember, we're moving along the x-axis.So if our velocity's negative,that means that x is decreasing or we're moving to the left.What is the particle's acceleration a of tat t equals three?So pause this video again, and see if you can do that.Well, here the realization isthat acceleration is a function of time.It's just the derivative of velocity,which is the second derivative of our position,which is just going to be equal tothe derivative of this right over here.And so I'm just going to getderivative of three t squared with respect to t is six t.Derivative of negative eight twith respect to t is minus eight.And derivative of a constant is zero.So it's just going to be six t minus eight.So our acceleration at time t equals threeis going to be six times three, which is 18, minus eight,so minus eight, which is going to be equal to positive 10.All right, now they ask us what is the directionof the particle's motion at t equals two?Well, I already talked about this, but pause this video andsee if you can answer that yourself.Well, we've already looked at the sign right over here.The fact that we have a negative sign on our velocitymeans we are moving towards the left.So I'll fill that in right over there.At t equals three, is the particle's speedincreasing, decreasing, or neither?So pause this video, and try to answer that.All right, now we have to be very careful here.If it says is the particle's velocityincreasing, decreasing, or neither,then we would just have to look at the acceleration.We see that the acceleration is positive,and so we know that the velocity is increasing.But here they're not saying velocity, they're saying speed.And just as a reminder, speed is the magnitude of velocity.So, for example, at time t equals two,our velocity is negative one.If the units were meters and second,it would be negative one meters per second.But our speed would just be one meter per second.Speed, you're not talking about the direction,so you would not have that sign there.And so in order to figure outif the speed is increasing or decreasing or neither,if the acceleration is positiveand the velocity is positive,that means the magnitude of your velocity is increasing.So that means your speed is increasing.If your velocity is negativeand your acceleration is also negative,that also means that your speed is increasing.But if your velocity and acceleration have different signs,well, that means that your speed is decreasing.The magnitude of your velocity would become less.So let's look at our velocity at time t equals three.Our velocity at time three, we just go back right over here,it's going to be three times nine,which is 27, three times three squared,minus 24plus three,plus three.So this is going to be equal to six.So our velocity and acceleration are both,you could say, in the same direction.They are both positive.And so our velocity's only going to become more positive,or the magnitude of our velocity is only going to increase.So our speed is increasing.If our velocity wasnegative at time t equals three,then our speed would be decreasing because our accelerationand velocity would be going in different directions.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-straight-line-motion/v/analyzing-particle-movement-based-on-graphs	khanacademy	video	:00A particle moves along a number line not shown for tis greater than or equal to 0.Its position function, s of t, is shown in blue.So this is its position as a function of time.Its velocity function, v of t, is in red.That's velocity.And its acceleration function, a if t, is in green.All are graphed with respect to time t in seconds.With the graphs as an aid, answer the questions below.So that's what's going on here.So it's position as a function of time.Actually, let me just draw their number linethat they did not depict just so we can really think about this.So let's say that's our number line.Let's say this right over here is 0.That's 1.That is 2.This is negative 1.So we're defining going to the rightas the positive direction.So what's happening here?So at time equals 0 right over here, s of 0 is 0.And then as time increases, our positionincreases all the way until time equals 1.At time equals 1, our position is 2.So at time equals 1, our position is 2.And then our position, s of t, starts decreasing.So one way to think about it is, and you see we move up,we move to the right really fast.We get to 2.We stop at 2, and then we start moving to the left.So at time equals 0, the first second looks like this.We go zoom, oh, slow down and stop.And then we start moving the other way.And then we start drifting.Notice our position is decreasing.So our position is decreasing, but it'sdecreasing at ever slower, slower, and slower and slowerrates.It's not clear if we'll ever get back to the origin.So that's what's going on here.And we see that no matter which graph we look at.Our position function is definitely telling that story.Our velocity function, which is the derivative of the positionfunction, is telling that story.Out the gate, we have a high positive velocity,but we decelerate quickly.And at 1 second, our velocity is 0,and then we start having a negative velocity, whichmeans we're moving to the left.So fast rightward velocity, but we decelerate quickly,stop at time equals 1 second, and thenwe start drifting to the left.And the acceleration also shows that same narrative.But anyway, let's actually answer the questions.The initial velocity of the particleis blank units per second.I encourage you to pause this video and answer that.Well, we just said the velocity, let's see, at time equals 0,we're at 8 units per second.So we'll just put 8 right over there.The particles moving to the right whent is in the interval, and since they're doing thisas a member of, they really want this kind of in the setnotation t is a member of the interval.Well, when are we moving to the right?We already went over that.We're moving it to the right-- there'sa couple of ways to think about it.When our velocity is greater than-- sowe're moving to the right when v of t is greater than 0.When v of t is less than 0, we're moving to the left.When v of t is equal to 0, we're stationary.So when is v of t greater than 0?Well, it's between t being 0, velocity is definitelypositive, all the way to t is 1, but not including t is 1.So I'll put a parentheses there.So this is equivalent to saying--so t is a member of that intervalis equivalent to saying that 0 is less than or equal to tis less than 1.Once again, the first second, at time 0,we're going fast, slow down, and then stopfor an infinitesimal moment, and then we start drifting back.That happens at time equals 1.We start drifting back.The total distance traveled by the particle for tin the interval between 0 and 3 is blank units.So once again, I encourage you to pause the videoand try to answer that, the total distance.So this is interesting.Don't get distance confused with displacement.If I were to move three to the rightand then I were to move back one to the left,the total distance I've traveled is four.The distance I traveled is four, while the displacementwould be a positive.We could maybe put a minus 1 there.We moved one to the left.So three to the right, one to the left.Well, our displacement would be a net of positive 2.So they're asking, what's the total distance traveled?So between time 0 and time 1, we have moved two to the right.And then between time 1 and time 3, we move back,or to the left, we move half.So to the left, we move half.So what's our total distance?It's going to be two to the rightplus half to the left, which is going to be 2.5 units.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-straight-line-motion/v/total-distance-traveled-by-a-particle	khanacademy	video	:00The position of a particle moving alonga number line is given by s of t isequal to 2/3 t to the third minus 6t squared plus 10t,for t is greater than or equal to 0,where t is time in seconds.The particle moves both left and right in the first 6 seconds.What is the total distance traveled by the particle for 0is less than or equal to t is less than or equal to 6?So let's just remind ourselves whatthey mean by total distance.If I were to say start there, and if Iwere to move 3 units to the rightand then I were to move 4 units to the left,and I'll say negative 4 to show that I'm moving to the left,then my total distance right over here is 7.3 to the right and 4 to the left.Even though my position right over hereis going to be negative 1.Or you could say my net distance,or you could say my displacement is negative 1.I'm 1 to the left of where I started.The total distance is 7.So now we've clarified that.I encourage you to now pause this videoand try to answer the question.What is the total distance traveledby the particle in these first 6 seconds?So the easiest way I can think of addressingthis is to think about, well, whenis this thing moving to the rightand when is it moving to the left?And it's going to be moving to the rightwhen the velocity is positive, and it'sgoing to be moving to the left when the velocity is negative.So this really boils down to thinkingabout when is the velocity positive or negative.And to think about that, let's actuallygraph the velocity function or make a rough sketch of it.So this is the position function.The velocity function is going to bethe derivative of the position function with respect to time.So the derivative of 2/3 t to the thirdis going to be 2t squared.And then we have minus 12t plus 10.And so let's just try to graph this.This is going to be an upward opening parabola.This is clearly a quadratic.And the coefficient on the second degree term,on the t squared term, is a positive number,so it's going to be an upward opening parabola.It's going to look something like this.And we're assuming that it switches direction.So it's going to be positive some of the timeand negative for some of the time.So it should intersect the t-axis where it's negative.The function is going to be negative in that interval,and it's going to be positive outside of that interval.So the easiest thing I could think of doingis let's try to find what the 0's are.Then we can draw this upward opening parabola.So to find its 0's, let's just set this thing equal to 0so we get 2t squared minus 12t plus 10 is equal to 0.Divide both sides by 2 just to get rid of this 2,make this leading coefficient a 1.We get t squared minus 6t plus 5 is equal to 0.That made it a lot easier to factor.This can be factored into t minus 1 times t minus 5.Negative 1 times negative 5 is 5.Negative 1 plus negative 5 is negative 6.This is equal to 0.So this left hand side of the equationis going to be equal to 0 if either one of these thingsis equal to 0.Take the product of two things equaling 0,well, you get 0 if either one of them is 0.So either t is equal to 1 or t is equal to 5.So now let's graph it.So let's draw our axes.So I could say that's my velocity axis.And let me draw the-- we only carefor positive values of time.So let's draw something like this.Positive time.And let's see.Let's take that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.We could keep going.So this is t equals 1.This is t is equal to 5.This is our t-axis.And let's graph it.So it's going to be an upward opening parabola.It's going to intersect both of these points.And so its vertex is going to be whent is equal to 3 right in between those points.So it's going to look something like this.That's the only way to make an upward opening parabola thatintersects the t-axis at both of these points.So it'll go like that, and it'll go like this.It'll intersect.When t equals 0, we actually can figure out.When t equals 0 our velocity is 10.So the v-intercept, we could say, is 10 right over here.So that's what it looks like.So we see that the velocity is positive for timebetween 0 and 1.And it's also positive for time is greater than 5 seconds.And we see that our velocity is negative,or that we're moving to the left, between 1 and 5 seconds.The velocity is below the t-axis right over here.It is negative.So let's just think about what our position isat each of these points, at time 0, at time 1, at time 5,and what we care about time 6.And then think about what the distanceit would have had to travel between those times.So let's think about it.So let's make a little table here.Let's make a little table.So this is time, and this is our position at that time.So we care about time 0, time 1, time 5 seconds,and time 6 seconds.So at 0 seconds, we know that our position is 0.S of 0 is 0.At 1 second, this is going to be 2/3 minus 6 plus 10.So it's going to be 4 and 2/3.So I'll write down 4 and 2/3.At 5 seconds, let's see, it's 2/3 times--I'm going to write this one down.So it's going to be 2/3 times 125.That's the same thing as 250 over 3,which is the same thing.Let's see, 250 over 3.That's the same.83 times 3 is 249, so this is 83 and 1/3.That's this first term.Minus 6 times 25.So that's going to be minus 150 plus 10 times 5.So plus 50.So this is going to simplify.Minus 150 plus 50, that's going to be minus 100.83 and 1/3 minus 100.That's going to be negative 16 and 2/3.So negative 16 and 2/3 is its position after 5 seconds.And then at the 6 seconds, it's goingto be 2/3 times 6 to the third.I have to write this one down.2/3 times 6 to the third minus 6 times 6 squared.Well, that's just going to be minus 6 to the third again.6 times 6 squared plus 60.And let's see.How can we simplify this right over here?Well, this part right over here wecan rewrite as-- we could factor out as 6 to the third.This is 6 to the third times 2/3 minus 1 plus 60.Scroll down a little bit and get some more space.So it's going to be 6 to the third times negative 1/3plus 60.And let's see.Let's write it this way.This is going to be 6 squared times 6 times negative 1/3plus 60.This right over here is negative 2.So it's negative 2 times 36.This is negative 72 plus 60.So this is going to be negative 12 right over there.So now we just have to think, how far did it travel?Well, it starts traveling to the right.It's going to travel to the right 4 and 2/3.So let's write this down.So we're going to have 4 and 2/3.And then it's going to travel to the left.Let's see, to go from 4 and 2/3 to negative 16 and 2/3,that means you traveled 4 and 2/3 again.You traveled 4 and 2/3 to the left,and then you traveled another 16 and 2/3 to the left.Just a reminder, we're 4 and 2/3 to the right now.We have to go 4 and 2/3 to the left back to the origin,and then we have to go 16 and 2/3 again to the left.So that's why this move from here to hereis going to be 4 and 2/3 to the left followed by 16 and 2/3to the left.Another way to think about it, the differencebetween these two points is what?It's going to be 4 and 2/3 plus 16 and 2/3.If you do 4 and 2/3 minus negative 16 and 2/3,you're going to have, that's the same thing as 4 and 2/3plus 16 and 2/3.And then to go from negative 16 and 2/3 to negative 12,that means you went another 4 and 2/3 now to the right.So now this is 4 and 2/3.Now you're moving 4 and 2/3 to the right.And so we just have to add up all of these.We just have to add up all of these values.So what is this going to be?So this is going to be 2/3 times 4, so this part of itright over here, the fraction part of it.2/3 times 4 is 8 over 3.And let's see, 4 plus 4 plus 16 plus 4 is 28.So 28 and 8/3, that's a very strange way to write it.Because 8/3 is the same thing as 2 and 2/3.So 28 plus 2 and 2/3 is 30 and 2/3.So the total distance traveled over those 6 secondsis 30 and

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-derivatives/v/modeling-a-forgetting-curve	khanacademy	video	:00I studied for an English test todayand learned 80 vocabulary words.In 10 days, I will have forgotten every word.The number of words that I remember t days after studyingis modeled by-- so W of t, so this is the number of words Ihave in my head as a function of time is going to be equal to 80times 1 minus 0.1t squared for t is between 0 and 10,including the two boundaries.That's why we have brackets right over here.What is the rate of change of the numberof known words per day two days after studying for the test?And I encourage you to pause this videoand try it on your own.So the key here is we come up with this equation for modelinghow many words have retained in my brain every dayafter I first memorized them, after Igot the 80 of them into my head?And that's this expression here.And they want to know the rate of changetwo days after studying.Well, the rate of change, I can take the derivativeof this with respect to time.So let's do that.So let's take the derivative.The derivative of the number of wordsI know with respect to time is going to be equal to-- well,we have this 80 out front.That's just a constant.And now I can apply the chain rule right over here.So the derivative of 1 minus 0.1t,the whole thing squared with respect to 1 minus 0.1t isgoing to be-- so I'm essentially taking the derivative of thiswhole pink thing, this whole expression squared with respectto the expression.So that's going to be 2 times 1 minus 0.1t.And now I can find the derivativeof this inner expression with respect to t.So the derivative of this inner expression with respect to tis just going to be 0 minus 0.1.So it's just going to be negative 0.1.And of course, we can simplify this a little bit.This is going to be equal to-- if we take 80 times 2is 160 times negative 0.1, that's going to be negative 16.160 times 0.1 is 16, so negative 16 times 1 minus 0.1t.And if we want, we could distribute the 16,or we could just leave it like this.But we're ready now to answer our question.We could write this as the rate of changeof the number of words we know with respect to time.Or we could use the alternate notation.We could say this is W prime of t.Either way, it's going to be equal to this thing.Let me do that same color.It's equal to negative 16 times 1 minus 0.1t.So what's this going to be?What is the rate of change of the number of wordsknown per day two days after studying for the test?Well, we just have to evaluate this when t is equal to 2.So W prime of 2 is going to be equal to negative 16 times 1minus 0.1 times 2 close parentheses.And that's going to be equal to-- well,let's see, what is this?This is 1 minus essentially 0.2.This is going to be 0.8.So this is going to be equal to negative 16 times--is that right?1 minus 0.2 is-- yep, it's going to be times 0.8.And what is that going to be?If I were to multiply 16 times 8, it would be 128.It's 2 times 8 times 8 so 2 times 64, 128.So this is going to be negative 12.8.And just to really hit the point home of what we're doing,the rate of change is negative 12.8 words per day.So if you believe this model for how many wordswe know on a given day, this is saying on day two,right at the day two point, rightafter exactly two days after studying for the test, rightat that moment, I am essentially losing 12.8 words per day.The number of words I know is decreasingby 12.8 words per day.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-derivatives/v/derivative-and-marginal-cost	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say I run some type of a factory,and I've studied my operations.And I'm able to figure out how my cost variesas a function of quantity over a week, on a weekly period.And so to visualize that, let me draw it.I could draw this cost function.So this is my cost axis.This right over here could be my quantity axis.So that's quantity, or q, let me just call that q.That's my q-axis.And my function might look something like this.It seems reasonable to me.Even if I produce nothing, I still have fixed costs.I have to pay rent on the factory.I have to probably pay people even if we produce nothing.And so let's say that fixed costs in the week is $1,000.And then as my quantity increases, so do my costs.So if I produce 100 units right over here,then my cost goes up to $1,300.If I produce more than that, you see my costs increaseand they increase at an ever faster rate.Now, I go into a lot more depth on things like cost functionsin the Economics playlist, but whatI want to think about in the calculus context is what wouldthe derivative of this represent?What would the derivative of c with respect to q, which couldalso written as c prime of q, what does that represent?Well, if we think about it visually,we know that we can think about the derivativeas the slope of the tangent line.So, for example, that's the tangent linewhen q is equal to 100.So the slope of that tangent line you could view as c prime,or it is c prime of 100.But what is that slope telling us?Well, the slope is the change in our cost dividedby the change in our quantity.And it's the slope of the tangent line.This is what we first learned in calculus.As we get to smaller and smaller and smaller changesin quantity, we essentially take the limitas our change in quantity approaches 0.That's how we get that instantaneous change.So one way to think about it is this is the instantaneous.This is the rate right on the marginat which is our cost is changing with respect to quantity.So if I were to produce just another drop, another atomof whatever I'm producing, at what rateis my cost going to increase?And the reason why I'm saying right on the marginis we see that it's not constant.If our cost function were aligned,we would have a constant slope.The tangent line would essentiallybe the cost function.But we see it changes right over here.The incremental atom to produce herecosts less than the incremental atom right over here.The slope has gone up.And it might make sense.Maybe I'm using some raw material out therein the world.And as I use more and more of it,it becomes more and more scarce.And so the market price of it goes up and up and up.But you might say, well, why do I evencare about the rate at which my costs are increasingon the margin?Which is why this is called marginal cost.Well, the reason why you care about it is youmight be trying to figure out when do I stop producing?Let's say this is orange juice.If I know that next gallon is going to cost me $5 to produceand I can sell it for $6, then I'm going to do it.But if that next gallon, if I'm up here,and I've already produced a lot, and I'mtaking all the oranges off the market,and now I have to transport orangesfrom the other side of the planet or whatever it might be,and now if that incremental gallon of oranges or gallonof orange juice costs me $10 to produce,and I'm not going to be able to sell it for more than $6,it doesn't make sense for me to produce it anymore.So in a calculus context, or you can say in an economicscontext, if you can model your cost as a function of quantity,the derivative of that is the marginal cost.It's the rate at which costs are increasingfor that incremental unit.And there's other similar ideas.If we modeled our profit as a function of quantity,if we took the derivative, that would be our marginal profit.If we modeled revenue, that would be our marginal revenue.How much does a function increaseas we increase our input, as we increaseour quantity on the margin?
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/rates-of-change-between-radius-and-area-of-circle	khanacademy	video	:00So let's say that we've got a pool of waterand I drop a rock into the middle of that pool of water.And a little while later, a little wave, a ripplehas formed that is moving radially outward from whereI dropped the rock.So let's see how well I can draw that.So it's moving radially outwards.So that is the ripple that is formedfrom me dropping the rock into the water.So it's a circle centered at where the rock initiallyhit the water.And let's say right at this moment the radius of the circleis equal to 3 centimeters.And we also know that the radius is increasingat a rate of 1 centimeter per second.So radius growing at rate of 1 centimeter per second.So given this, right now our circle,our ripple circle has a radius of 3 centimeters.And we know that the radius is growingat 1 centimeter per second.Given that, at what rate is the area growing?At what rate is area of circle growing?Interesting.So let's think about what we knowand then what we don't know, what we'retrying to figure out.So if we call this radius r, we know that right now ris equal to 3 centimeters.We also know the rate at which r ischanging with respect to time.We also know this information right over here. dr dt,the rate at which the radius is changing with respect to time,is 1 centimeter per second.Now what do we need to figure out?Well, they say at what rate is the area of the circle growing?So we need to figure out at what rateis the area of the circle-- wherea is the area of the circle-- at what rate is this growing?This is what we need to figure out.So what might be useful here is if wecan come up with a relationship between the area of the circleand the radius of the circle and maybe takethe derivative with respect to time.And we'll have to use a little bit of the chain ruleto do that.So what is the relationship at any given pointin time between the area of the circleand the radius of the circle?Well, this is elementary geometry.The area of a circle is going to beequal to pi times the radius of the circle squared.Now what we want to do is figure outthe rate at which the area is changing with respect to time.So why don't we take the derivativeof both sides of this with respect to time?And let me give myself a little more real estate.Actually, let me just rewrite what I just had.So pi r squared.Area is equal to pi r squared.I'm going to take the derivative of both sides of thiswith respect to time.So the derivative with respect to time.I'm not taking the derivative with respect to r,I'm taking the derivative with respect to time.So on the left-hand side right over here,I'm going to have the derivative of our area.Actually, let me just write it in that green color.I'm going to have the derivative of our areawith respect to time on the left-hand side.And on the right-hand side, what do I have?Well, if I'm taking the derivative of a constant timessomething, I can take the constant out.So let me just do that.Pi times the derivative with respect to time of r squared.And to make it a little bit clearer what I'm about to do,why I'm using the chain rule, we'reassuming that r is a function of time.If r wasn't a function of time thenarea wouldn't be a function of time.So instead of just writing r, let me make it explicitthat it is a function of time.I'll write r of t.So it's r of t, which we're squaring.And we want to find the derivative of this with respectto time.And here we just have to apply the chain rule.We're taking the derivative of something squared with respectto that something.So the derivative of that something squared with respectto the something is going to be 2 times that somethingto the first power.Let me make it clear.This is the derivative of r of t squared with respect to r of t.The derivative of something squared with respectto that something.If it was a derivative of x squared with respect to x,we'd have 2x.If it was the derivative of r of t squared with respect to rof t, it's 2r of t.But this doesn't get us just the derivative with respectto time.This is just the derivative with respect to r of t.The derivative at which this changes with respect to time,we have to multiply this times the rate at which r of tchanges with respect to time.So the rate at which r of t changes with respect to time?Well, we could just write that as dr dt.These are equivalent expressions.And of course, we have our pi out front.And I just want to emphasize this is justthe chain rule right over here.The derivative of something squared with respect to timeis going to be the derivative of the something squaredwith respect to the something.So that's 2 times the something, times the derivativeof that something with respect to time.I can't emphasize enough.What we did right over here, this is the chain rule.That is the chain rule.So we're left with pi times this isequal to the derivative of our area with respect to time.Now let me rewrite all this againjust so it cleans up a little bit.So we have the derivative of our area with respectto time is equal to pi times-- actuallylet me put that 2 out front.Is equal to 2 times pi times-- I can nowswitch back to just calling this r.We know that r is a function of t.So I'll just write 2 pi times r times dr dt.Actually, let me make the r in blue.2 pi r dr dt.Now what do we know?We know what r is.We know that r, at this moment right in time,is 3 centimeters.Right now r is 3 centimeters.We know dr dt right now is 1 centimeter per second.We know this is 1 centimeter per second.So what's da dt going to be equal to?Well, it's going to be equal to-- do that same green-- 2pi times 3 times 3 times 1 times-- that'spurple-- times 1 centimeter per second.And let's make sure we get the units right.So we have a centimeter times a centimeter.So it's going to be centimeters.That's too dark of a color.It's going to be square centimeters, centimeterstimes centimeters, square centimeter per second, whichis the exact units we need for a change in area.So we have da dt is equal to this. da, the rate at whicharea is changing with respect to time, is equal to 6 pi.So it's going to be a little bit over 18 centimeters squaredper second.Right at that moment.Yep, 3 times 2 pi.So 6 pi centimeters squared per secondis how fast the area is changing.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/analyzing-related-rates-problems-expressions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The base b of t of a triangle is decreasingat a rate of 13 meters per hour,and the height h of t of the triangle is increasingat a rate of six meters per hour.At a certain instant t sub zero,the base is five meters and the height is one meter.What is the rate of change of the area A of t,so our area is going to be a function t,what is the rate of change of the areaof the triangle at that instant?And so what we're going to do in this exercise,instead of going straight and trying to solve it,what we need to do here is to identify the various unitsof different expressions and then try to think aboutwhat information is given and what's not.And then that will actually equip usto actually solve this rate of change problem.So let's just do this first part.Let's match each expression with its units.And like always, pause the video,and see if you can do it on your own.All right, so the first one is b prime of t.So this is the rate of change at which,of which the base is changing with respect to time.So if we think about it, b of t, that is the base.That is going to be in meters.So this is going to be in meters.If we say b prime of t,this is going to be how much our base is changingwith respect to time.So this is going to be meters per,and they give us right over here,they say it's decreasing at a rate of 13 meters per hour,so the units here are meters per hour.And so b prime of t, that is going to be in meters per hour.A attime t sub zero,remember, A is the area of our triangle.And we're measuring everything in meters.You can tell from the information they've given us.And so area is going to be in square units,and so it's going to be in square meters.Now, the height at time t sub zero,well, both the base and the height, those are lengths.They're gonna be measured in meters,and so our height at time t sub zero is goingto be in meters.And then here we have the rate of changeof our area with respect to time.So our area, we already know is in meters squared.But we want know this here,that this is going to be the rate of changeof our area with respect to time.So it's going to be an amount of area per unit time.And time here, we're using hours, as you can seefrom some of the information they've given us.So this is going to be area per unit time,or meters squared per hour.So it's going to be right over here.That's area per unit time.And the length we're using in this is meters,and time is hours.All right.Now they say match each expression with its given value.So what isthe base of the triangleat time t sub zero?Do they give that to us?Well, let's see.They say, at a certain time,at a certain instant t sub zero, the base,I'm gonna underline this in a different color,the base at a certaininstant t sub zero,the base is five meters.So they say the base at time t sub zero,the base is a function of time,but they tell us that it is five meters.So this is five meters right over here.Now what about the rate of changeof the base with respect to time?Do they tell us that?Well, look right over here.That's actually the first piece of information they gave us.The base b of t of a triangle is decreasingat a rate of 13 meters per hour.So the rate of change of the base,that it b prime of t,which is equal to db/dt,and they tell us that that is,it's decreasing at a rate of 13 meters per hour.So that would be negative 13 meters per hour.And so the rate of change of the base with respect to timeis going to be negative 13.They gave us that.Now A prime of t, this is the rate of change of the areaat time t sub zero.Did they give us this?Well, they ask us that.What is the rate of change of the area A of tof the triangle at that instant?So this is what we actually need to figure out,but they haven't given it to us,otherwise there is no problem to solve.So this one right over here is not given.In fact, this is what we are trying to solve for.And then finally we havethe first derivative of the height with respect to time.So you could view this as dh/dt.What is this going to be?Do they give it to us?Well, look right over here.They say the height of the triangle is increasingat a rate of six meters per hour.So if they're saying h of t is increasing,they're telling us the rate of changeof h of t with respect to time,so that's h prime of t.And they're telling us that it is increasingat six meters per hour,so it's gonna be positive six meters per hour.So they did indeed give us that.Now why is all of this a useful exercise to go through?Well, now we are really ready to solve the question.Because, in general, if we're talking about any triangle,we know that areais equal to 1/2 base times height.Now in this situation, area and our base and our height,they're all going to be functions of t,so we could write A of tis equal to 1/2 times b of ttimes h of t.And if we want to find the rate of changeof our area at that instant,and the instant that they're talking aboutis at time t sub zero,well, then what we would want to do is take the derivativeof both sides with respect to t.So the derivative on the left-hand sidewith respect to t would be A prime of t,and then on the right-hand side it would be 1/2 times,and we would actually use a combination of,well, it's really just the product rule right over here.The derivative of the first function with respect to t,so it's b prime of t times the second function,this is just the product rule here,plus the first function b of ttimes the derivative of the second functionwith respect to time.And we need to figure out not just the general expression,they want us to know what the rate of change of the area,so A prime of t at that instant, at t sub zero.So what we want to figure out,we want to figure out A prime at time t sub zero.Well, that's just going to be equal to 1/2 times b primeof t sub zero times h of t sub zero,plus b of t sub zero,times h prime of t sub zero.Now this might seem daunting,except they've given us a lot of this information.What is b primeof t sub zero?Well, they tell us the rate of changeof b with respect to time,and it seems like it's just gonna stayat negative 13 meters per hour.So they gave us this.H, what is the height at time t sub zero?Well, they tell us right over here.At a certain instant, the base is five metersand the height is one meter.So they give us both b and h at t sub zero.So they gave us this.They gave us this.And what is the rate of change of the heightat time t sub zero?Well, they tell us.The height of the triangle is increasingat a rate of six meters per hour.So they tell us that as well.All of that stuff is given,and so you just have to plug it in to figure outwhat is the rate of change of the area at t sub zero,at that instant.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/analyzing-related-rates-problems-equations	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Two cars are drivingtowards an intersection from perpendicular directions.The first car's velocity is 50 km/hand the second car's velocity is 90 km/h.At a certain instant, T sub zero,the first car is a distance, X sub T sub zeroor X of T sub zero, of half a kilometerfrom the intersection and the second caris a distance, Y of T sub zero,of 1.2 kilometers from the intersection.What is the rate of change of the distance,D of T, between the cars at that instant?So, T sub zero.Which equation should be used to solve the problem?And they give us a choice of four equations,right over here, so you could pause the videoand try to work through it on your ownbut I'm about to do it, as well.So, let's just draw what's going on.That's always a healthy thing to do.So, two cars are driving towardsan intersection from perpendicular directions.So, let's say that this is one car right over hereand it is moving in the X directiontowards that intersection, which is right over there.And then you have another carthat is moving in the Y direction.So, let's say it's moving like this.So, this is the other car.I should have maybe done a top view.Well, here we go.This square represents the carand it is moving in that direction.Now, they say at a certain instance.T sub zero, so let's draw that instant.So, the first car is a distance,X of T sub zero, of 0.5 kilometers.So, this distance, right over here,let's just call this X of T and let's callthis distance, right over here, Y of T.Now, how does the distance between thecars relate to X of T and Y of T?Well, we could just use the distance formula,which is essentially just the Pythagorean theorem,to say, well, the distance between the carswould be the hypotenuse of this right triangle.Remember, they're traveling from perpendicular directions.So, that's a right triangle, there.So, this distance, right over here, would be X of T squaredplus Y of T squared, and the square root of that,and that's just the Pythagorean theorem, right over here.This would be D of T, or we could saythat D of T squared is equal toX of T squared plus Y, too many parentheses.Plus Y of T squared.So, that's the relationship betweenD of T, X of T, and Y of T, and it's usefulfor solving this problem because, now,we can take the derivative of both sidesof this equation with respect to T.We'd be using various derivative rules,including the chain rule, in order to do it,and then that would give us a relationshipbetween the rate of change of D of T,which would be D prime of T,and the rate of change of X of T, Y of T,and X of T and Y of T, themselves.And so, if we look at these choices, right over here,we indeed see that D sets up that exactsame relationship that we just did, ourselves.That it shows that the distancesquared between the cars is equal tothat X distance from the intersection squared,plus the Y distance from the intersection squared,and then we can take the derivative of both sidesto actually figure out this related, rates question.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/related-rates-example-with-trigonometry	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] A 20-meter ladder is leaning against a wall.The distance X of T between the bottom of the ladderand the wall is increasing at a rateof three meters per minute.At a certain instant T sub zerothe top of the ladder is a distance Y of T sub zeroof 15 meters from the ground.What is the rate of change of the angletheta of T between the groundand the ladder at that instant?So what I want to do is draw this out.And really, the first step is to think about,well, what equation will be helpfulfor us to solve this problem.And then we might just go ahead andactually solve the problem.So a 20-meter ladder is leaning against a wall.So let me draw ourselves a wall here.That is my wall.Now let me draw our 20-meter ladder.So maybe it looks something like that.So that is 20meters.They say the distance X of T between the bottomof the ladder and the wall.So, this distance right over here.This isthis distance right over here isX of T.They say it's increasing at a rate ofthree meters per minute.So, we know that we could either sayX prime of T, which is the same thingas DX DT.Is equal to three meters,I'll write it out because it's hard if I said M per Mit might not be that clear.Meters per minute, so they give usthat piece of information.So the rate of change of X, with respect to time,they gave us that.At a certain sub T sub zerothe top of the ladder is a distanceof 15 meters.So the top of the ladder, so let's make this very clear.So, this distancerightover hereis Y of T.Y of T.And they say, at time T sub zeroY of T is 15 meters.So let me just write it in here, Y of T sub zerois equal to 15 meters.And so, maybe let me write this right over here.This is Y of T sub zero.Let's just assume that we're drawing itat that moment T sub zero, because I thinkthat's going to be important.Y of T sub zero is equal to 15meters.So they want to know, what is the rate of changeof the angle theta between the ground and the ladder.And this is saying theta is also going to changewith respect to time.There's going to be a function of timebetween the ground and the ladder at that instant.So theta, get a new color here.Theta is this angle right over here, this is theta.And it's also going to be a function of time.So, what we'll always want to do in theserelated rates problems is we want toset up an equation, and really, an algebraic equationmaybe a little bit of trigonometry involved.That relates the things that we care about.And then we're likely to have to takethe derivative of both sides of thatin order to relate the related rates.So let's see.We want to knowwe want to know the rate of changeof the angle betweenthe ground and the ladder at that instant.So what we need to figure outwe want to figure out, theta prime, at T sub zero.This is what we want to figure out.Now, they've given us some interesting things,they've given us, I guess, our rate of changeof X with perspective time is constantat three meters per minute.And, we know what Y is at that moment.So let's see, can we create a relationshipbecause they gave us DX DTit'll actually be more usefulto find a relationship between X and theta,and then take the derivative of both sides.And then use this information possiblyto figure out what the appropriatevalue of X or theta isat that moment.So let's do that.So how does X relate to theta?Well, we use a little bit oftrigonometry right over here.If you took the hypotenusetimes the cosine of thetayou would get X.So let me write this right up here, X of TX of Tis equal tothe hypotenuse20 meters, because that's the length of the ladder,times the cosinecosine of theta.And I can say the cosine of theta of Tjust to make it clear that thisis a function of time.This comes straight out of trigonometry.Actually, our basic trig, trigonometricfunction definitions.Now, why is this useful, why do I think this is useful?Well let's think about what happens when I takethe derivative of both sides using the chain rule.On the left hand side, I am going to havean X prime of T.And then that's going to be equal to, what do I endup with on the right hand side?Well, using the chain rule, first, I'll takethe derivative with respect to theta.And so that's just going to benegative 20 sineoftheta of T.And I need to multiple thattimes theta prime of T.So what I can do is, say hey look,at T sub zero, I know what X prime of T is.I could try to figure out what sine of theta of T isand then I'll just solve for thisright over there.So let's do that.So, at T sub zeroso at T is equal toT sub zero.What we're gonna have X prime of T.Well that, at every time, it's three meters per minutewe'll assume that our rates are in meters per minute.And just our values are in meterswhen we're talking about distanceand our angles are in radians.So, this is going to be equal to threeis equal tonegative 20times sine of theta of Ttimes the derivative of data with respect to time.So, how do we figure out what sine of thetaof T is going to be?Well, let's just use that other information they gave us.And I'm gonna scroll down a little bitto get a little bit more real estate.So sine of theta, let me write it over here.Sineof thetaat time T sub not, that's what we care aboutT is equal to T sub not.What's that gonna be?Well sine is opposite over hypotenuse.So that's gonna be Yat T sub not.Over our hypotenuseof 20 meters.Well that's going to be equal tothat's going to be equal to, they tell us,Y of T sub not is 15 metersover 20 meters.Which is the same thing as three fourths.So, by this yellow information, they actuallytold us that this right over hereis going to be equal to three fourths.So this times three fourthstimes the rate of changeof thetawith respect to T.And so now we just have to solve for this and we're done.So, this is going to be what'snegative 20 times three fourths?That is negative 15.That is negative 15.If we divide both sides by negative 15we gettheta prime of T is equal tothree over negative 15.Three over negative 15.Which is the same thing as being equal tonegative one fifth.And this, the units here would be inradians per minute.Because our rates are all in per minute.So, if I wanted to I could write radiansperminute.Ideally I would write itright over here.But here you go.We were able to figure out and this is an interesting one.Because, they give you that information on Ybut really, use that information of Yto figure out what sine of theta of T is.But the equation you set up involves X and theta.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/differentiating-related-functions-intro	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We are told the differentiable functionsX and Y are related by the following equation,Y is equal to square root of X.And it's interesting, they're telling usthat they are both differentiable functions,even X is a function, must be a function of something else.Well, they tell us that the derivative of Xwith respect to T is 12and they want us to find the derivative of Ywith respect to T when X is equal to nine.So, let's just make sure we can understand this.So, they're telling us that both X and Y are functions.Arguably they are both functions of T.Y is a function of Xbut then X is a function of Tso Y could also be a function of T.One way to think about it isif X is equal to F of T,then Y is equal to the square root of Xwhich would just be F of T.Another way to think about itif you took T as your inputinto your function F,you're going to produce Xand then if you took that as your inputinto the square root functionyou are going to produce Y.So, you could just view this as just one big box here,that Y is a function of Ybut now let's actually answer their question.To tackle it we just have to apply the chain rule.The chain rule tells us that the derivative of Ywith respect to Tis going to be equal to the derivative of Ywith respect to X times the derivative of Xwith respect to T.So, let's apply it to this particular situation.We're gonna have the derivative of Ywith respect to Tis equal to the derivative of Ywith respect to X.Well, what's that?Well, Y is equal to the principle root of X.You could also write this as Yis equal to X to the one half power.We could just use the power rule.The derivative of Y with respect to Xis one half X to the negative one half.So, let me write that down.One half X to the negative one halfand then times the derivative of Xwith respect to T times the derivative of Xwith respect to T.Well, let's see, we wanna find what we have here in orange,that's what the questions asks us.They tell us when X is equal to nineand the derivative of Xwith respect to T is equal to 12.So, we have all of the informationnecessary to solve for this.So, this is going to be equal to one halftimes nine to the negative one half,nine to the negative one half,times DX/DT, the derivative of X with respect to Tis equal to 12, times 12.So, let's see, nine to the one halfwould be three,nine to the negative one half would be 1/3,so this is 1/3,so this will all simplify to 1/2 times 1/3 is 1/6,so we could have a six in the denominatorand then we are going to have a 12 in the numerator.So, 12/6, so the derivative of Y with respect to Twhen X is equal to nineand derivative of X with respect to 12 is two.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-introduction-to-related-rates/v/differentiating-related-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- The differentiable functions x and y are relatedby the following equation.The sine of x plus cosine of yis equal to square root of two.They also tell us that the derivative of xwith respect to t is equal to five.They also ask us find the derivative of ywith respect to t when y is equal to pi over fourand zero is less than x is less than pi over two.So given that they are telling us the derivativeof x with respect to t and we wanna findthe derivative of y with respect to t,it's a safe assumption that both x and y are functions of t.So you could even rewrite this equation right over here.You could rewrite it as sine of x,which is a function of t,plus cosineof y, which is a function of t,is equal to square root of two.Now, it might confuse you a little bit,you're not used to seeing x as a functionof a third variable or y as a functionof something other than x.But remember, x and y are just variables.This could be f of t, and this could be g of tinstead of x of t and y of t,and that might feel a little more natural to you.But needless to say, if we wanna find dy dt,what we want to do is take the derivativewith respect to t of both sides of this equation.So let's do that.So we're gonna do it on the left-hand side,so it's gonna be we take that with respect to t,derivative of that with respect to t.We're gonna take the derivative of that with respect to t.And then we're gonna take the derivativeof the right-hand side, this constant with respect to t.So let's think about each of these things.So what is this.Let me do this in a new color.The stuff that I'm doing in this aqua color right over here,how could I write that?So I'm taking the derivative with respect to t,I have sine of something, which is itself a function of t.So I would just apply the chain rule here.I'm first going to take the derivative with respect to x ofsine ofx, I could write sine of x of t,but I'll just revert back to the sine of x herefor simplicity.And then I will then multiply that times the derivativeof the inside, you could say, with respect to ttimes the derivative of x with respect to t.This might be a little counterintuitiveto how you've applied the chain rule beforewhen we only dealt with xs and ys,but all that's happening, I'm taking the derivativeof the outside of the sine of somethingwith respect to the something, in this case, it is x,and then I'm taking the derivative of the something,in this case, x with respect to t.Well, we can do the same thing here,or this second term here.So I wanna take the derivative with respect to yof, I guess you could say the outside,of cosine of y,and then I would multiply thattimes the derivative of y with respect to t.And then all of that is going to be equal to what?Well, the derivative with respect to t of a constant,square root of two is a constant,it's not gonna change as t changes,so its derivative, its rate of change is zero.All right, so now we just have to figure outall of these things.So first of all, the derivative with respect to xof sine of x is cosine of x times the derivative of xwith respect to t, I'll just write that out here.The derivative of x with respect to t.And then we're going to have, it's gonna be a plus here,the derivative of y with respect to t.So plus the derivative of y with respect to t.I'm just flopping the order here,so that this goes out front.Now, what's the derivative of cosine of y with respect to y?Well, that is negative sine of y.And so, actually let me just put a sine of y here,then I'm gonna have a negative.Erase this and put a negative there.And that is all going to be equal to zero.And so what can we figure out now?They've told us that the derivative of x with respect to tis equal to five, they tell us that right over here.So this is equal to five.We wanna find the derivative of y with respect to t.They tell us what y is, y is pi over four.This, y is pi over four, so we know this is pi over four.And let's see, we have to figure out what,we still have two unknowns here.We don't know what x is and we don't knowwhat the derivative of y with respect to t is.This is what we need to figure out.So what would x be?What would x be when y is pi over four?Well, to figure that out,we can go back to this original equation right over here.So when y is pi over four, you get,let me write down.Sine of xplus cosine of piover four is equal to square root of two.Cosine of pi over four,we revert to our unit or we think about our unit circle.We're in the first quadrant.If we think in degrees, it's a 45 degree angle,that's gonna be square root of two over two.And so we can subtract square root of two over twofrom both sides, which is going to give ussine of x is equal to, well, if you take square root of twoover two from square root of two,you're taking half of it away,so you're gonna have half of it left.So square root of two over two.And so, what x value, when I take the sine of it,and remember, where the angle,if we're thinking when the unit circle is going to bein that first quadrant, x is an angle in this caseright over here.Well, that's going to be once again pi over four.So this tells us that x is equal to pi over fourwhen y is equal to pi over four.And so we know that this is pi over four as well.So let me just rewrite this,because it's getting a little bit messy.So we know that five timescosine of pi over fourminusdy dt, the derivative of y with respect to t,which is what we want to figure out,times sine of pi over four,is equal to zero,is equal to zero, and we put some parentheses here,just to clarify things a little bit.All right, so let's see.Now, it's just a little bit of algebra.Cosine of pi over four,we already know is square root of two over two.Sine of pi over four is also square root of two over two.Now let's see, what if we divide both sidesof this equation by square root of two over two?Well, what's that gonna give us?Well, then, this square root of two over twodivided by square root of two over,square root of two over two divided square root of twoover two is gonna be one.Square root of two over two dividedsquare root of two over two is gonna be one.And then zero divided by square root of two over twois just still going to be zero.And so this whole thing simplifies tofive times one, which is just five,minus the derivative of y with respect to tis equal to zero,and so there you have it.You add the derivative of y with respect to t to both sides,and we get the derivative of y with respect to t is equal tofive, when all of these other things are true.When the derivative of x with respect to t is five,and the derivative and y, I should say,is equal to pi over four.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-solving-related-rates-problems/v/falling-ladder-related-rates	khanacademy	video	:00So I've got a 10 foot ladder that's leaning against a wall.But it's on very slick ground, and it starts to slide outward.And right when it's-- and right at the moment thatwe're looking at this ladder, the base of the ladder is 8feet away from the base of the wall.And it's sliding outward at 4 feet per second.And we'll assume that the top of the latter kind of glidesalong the side of the wall, it stays kind of in contactwith the wall and moves straight down.And we see right over here, the arrow is moving straight down.And our question is, how fast is itmoving straight down at that moment?So let's think about this a little bit.What do we know and what do we not know?So if we call the distance between-- let's callthe distance between the base of the wall and the basethe ladder, let's call that x.We know right now x is equal to 8 feet.We also know the rate at which x ischanging with respect to time.The rate at which x is changing with respect to timeis 4 feet per second.So we could call this dx dt.Now let's call the distance between the top of the ladderand the base of the latter h.Let's call that h.So what we're really trying to figure outis what dh dt is, given that we knowall of this other information.So let's see if we can come up with the relationship between xand h and then take the derivative with respectto time, maybe using the chain rule.And see if we can solve for dh dt knowingall of this information.Well, we know the relationship between x and hat any time because of the Pythagorean theorem.We can assume this is a right angle.So we know that x squared plus h squared isgoing to be equal to the length of the ladder squared,is going to be equal to 100.And what we care about is the rateat which these things change with respect to time.So let's take the derivative with respectto time of both sides of this.We're doing a little bit of implicit differentiation.So what's the derivative with respect to time of x squared?Well the derivative of x squared with respect to x is 2x.And we're going to have to multiplythat times the derivative of x with respect to t, dx dt.Just to be clear, this is the chain rule.This is the derivative of x squared with respect to x,which is 2x, times dx dt to get the derivativeof x squared with respect to time.Just the chain rule.Now similarly, what's the derivative of hsquared with respect to time?Well that's just going to be 2h, the derivativeof h squared with respect to h is 2h timesthe derivative of h with respect to time.Once again, this right over here is the derivativeof h squared with respect to h, times the derivativeof h with respect to time, which gives us the derivative of hsquared with respect to time.And what do we get on the right-hand sideof our equation?Well the length of our ladder isn't changing.This 100 isn't going to change with respect to time.Derivative of a constant is just equal 0.So now we have it, a relationshipbetween the rate of change of h with respect to time.The rate of change of x with respect to time.And then at a given point in time,when the length of x is x and h is h.But do we know what h is when x is equal to 8 feet?Well, we can figure it out.When x is equal to 8 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theoremagain.We get 8 feet squared, plus h squaredis going to be equal to 100.So 8 squared is 64.Subtract it from both sides, you get h squared is equal to 36.Take the positive square root, a negative square rootdoesn't make sense because then the ladder wouldbe below the ground, it would be somehow underground.So we get h is equal to 6.So this is something that was essentiallygiven by the problem.So now we know.We can look at this original thing right over here,we know what x is, that was given.Right now x is 8 feet.We know the rate of change of x with respect to time.It's 4 feet per second.We know what h is right now, it is 6.So then we can solve for the rate of h with respect to time.So let's do that.So we get 2 times 8 feet, times 4 feetper second, so times 4, plus 2h, is goingto be plus 2 times, our height right now is 6,times the rate at which our height is changingwith respect to t is equal to 0.And so we get 2 times 8 times 4 is 64.Plus 12 dh dt is equal to 0.We can subtract 64 from both sides, we get 12.12 times the derivative of h with respect to timeis equal to negative 64.And then we just have to divide both sides by 12.And so now we get a little bit of a drum roll.The derivative, the rate of changeof h with respect to time is equal to negative 64 dividedby 12.It's equal to negative 64 over 12,which is the same thing as negative 16over 3, yeah that's right.Which is equal to-- let me scroll overto the right a little bit-- negative 5and 1/3 feet per second.So we're done.But let's just do a reality check,does that make sense that we got a negative value right overhere?Well our height is decreasing.So it completely makes sense that its rate of changeis indeed negative.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-solving-related-rates-problems/v/related-rates-of-water-pouring-into-cone	khanacademy	video	:00So we have got a very interesting scenario here.I have this conical thimble-like cup that is 4 centimeters high.And also, the diameter of the top of the cupis also 4 centimeters.And I'm pouring water into this cup right now.And I'm pouring the water at a rate of 1 cubic centimeter.1 cubic centimeter per second.And right at this moment, there is a heightof 2 centimeters of water in the cup right now.So the height right now from the bottom of the cup to this pointright over here is 2 centimeters.So my question to you is, at what rate--we know the rate at which the water is flowing into the cup,we're being given a volume per time.My question to you is right at this moment,right when we are filling our cupat 1 cubic centimeter per second.And we have exactly 2 centimetersof water in the cup, 2 centimeters deepof water in the cup, what is the rate at whichthe height of the water is changing?What is the rate at which this height right over hereis actually changing?We know it's 2 centimeters, but how fast is it changing?Well let's think about this a little bit.What are we being given?We're given-- we are being given the rate at whichthe volume of the water is changing with respect to time.So let's write that down.We are being given the rate at which the volume of the wateris changing with respect to time,and we're told that this is 1 cubic centimeter per second.And what are we trying to figure out?Well we're trying to figure out how fastthe height of the water is changing with respect to time.We know that the height right now is 2 centimeters.But what we want to figure out is the rateat which the height is changing with respect to time.If we can figure out this, then wehave essentially answered the question.So one way that we can do this is wecan come up with the relationship between the volumeat any moment in time and the height at any moment in time.And then maybe take the derivativeof that relationship, possibly using the chain rule,to come up with a relationship between the rate at whichthe volume is changing and the rate at which the height ischanging.So let's try to do it step by step.So first of all, can we come up with a relationshipbetween the volume and the height at any given moment?Well we have also been given the formulafor the volume of a cone right over here.The volume of a cone is 1/3 times the areaof the base of the cone, times the height.And we won't prove it here, although wecould prove it later on.Especially when we start doing solids of revolutionswithin in integral calculus.But we'll just take it on faith right now,that this is how we can figure out the volume of a cone.So given this can we figure out volume--can we figure out an expression that relates volumeto the height of the cone?Well we could say that volume-- and I'lldo it in this blue color-- the volume of wateris what we really care about.The volume of water is going to beequal to 1/3 times the area of the surface of the water--area of water surface-- times our height of the water.So times h.So how can we figure out the area of the water surface,preferably in terms of h?Well we see right over here, the diameteracross the top of the cone is 4 centimeters.And the height of the whole cup is 4 centimeters.And so that ratio is going to be true of any--at any depth of water.It's always going to have the same ratio between the diameteracross the top and the height.Because these are lines right over here.So at any given point, the ratio between this and thisis going to be the same.So at any given point, the diameteracross the surface of the water-- if the depth is h,the diameter across the surface of the wateris also going to be h.And so from that we can figure outwhat are the radius is going to be.The radius is going to be h over 2.And so the area of the water surfaceis going to be pi r squared, pi times the radius squared.h over 2 squared.That's the area of the surface of the water.And of course we still have the 1/3 out here.And we're still multiplying by this h over here.So let me see if I can simplify this.So this gives us 1/3 times pi h squared over 4 times another h,which is equal to-- we have pi, h to the third power over 12.So that is our volume.Now what we want to do is relate the volume, how fast the volumeis changing with respect to time,and how fast the height is changing with respect to time.So we care with respect to time, since we care so muchabout what's happening with respect to time,let's take the derivative of both sides of this equationwith respect to time.To do that, and just so I have enough space to do that,let me move this over.Let me move this over to the right a little bit.So I just move this over to the right.And so now we can take the derivative with respectto time of both sides of this business.So the derivative with respect to time of our volumeand the derivative with respect to time of this business.Well the derivative with respect to time of our volume,we could just rewrite that as dV dt, this thing right over here.This is dV dt, and this is going to beequal to-- well we could take the constants outof this-- this is going to be equal to pi over12 times the derivative with respect to t of h, of hto the third power.And just so that the next few things I dowill appear a little bit clearer,we're assuming that height is a function of time.In fact, it's definitely a function of time.As time goes on, the height will change.Because we're pouring more and more water here.So instead of just writing h to the third power, whichI could write over here, let me write h of tto the third power.Just to make it clear that this is a function of t.h of t to the third power.Now what is the derivative with respect to t,of h of t to the third power.Now, you might be getting a tingling feelingthat the chain rule might be applicable here.So let's think about the chain rule.The chain rule tells us-- let me rewrite everything else.dV with respect to t, is going to be equal to pi over 12,times the derivative of this with respect to t.If we want to take the derivative of this with respectto t, we have something to the third power.So we want to take the derivative of somethingto the third power with respect to something.So that's going to be-- let me writethis in a different color, maybe in orange-- so that'sgoing to be 3 times our something squared,times the derivative of that something, with respect to t.Times dh-- I've already used that pink-- times dh dt.Let's just be very clear.This orange term right over here-- and I'mjust using the chain rule-- this is the derivative of h of tto the third power with respect to h of t.And then we're going to multiply that times the derivative of hof t with respect to t.And then that gives us the derivativeof this entire thing, h of t to the third power, with respectto t.This will give us the derivative of hof t to the third power with respect to d with respectto t, which is exactly what we wantto do when we apply this operator.How fast is this changing?How is this changing with respect to time?So we can just rewrite this, justso gets a little bit cleaner.Let me rewrite everything I've done.So we've got dV, the rate at which our volume ischanging with respect to time.The rate at which our volume is changing with respect to timeis equal to pi over 12 times 3 h of t squared,or I could just write that as 3h squared,times the rate at which the height is changingwith respect to time, times dh dt.And you might be a little confused.You might have been tempted to take the derivative over herewith respect to h.But remember, we're thinking about howthings are changing with respect to time.So we're assuming-- we did express volumeas a function of height-- but we'resaying that height itself is a function of time.So we're taking the derivative of everythingwith respect to time.So that's why the chain rule came into playwhen we were taking the derivative of h,or the derivative of h of t, because we'reassuming that h is a function of time.Now what does this thing right over here get us?Well we're telling us at the exact momentthat we set up this problem, we knowwhat dV dt is, we know that it's 1 centimeter cubed per second.We know that this right over hereis 1 centimeter cubed per second.We know what our height is right at this moment.We were told it is 2 centimeters.So the only unknown we have over hereis the rate at which our height ischanging with respect to time.Which is exactly what we needed to figure outin the first place.So we just have to solve for that.So we get 1 cubic centimeter-- letme make it clear-- we get 1 cubic centimeter per second--I won't write the units to save some space-- isequal to pi over 2.And I'll write this in a neutral color.Actually, let me write in the same color.Is equal to pi over 2, times 3, times h squared.h is 2 so you're going to get 4 squared centimeters if wekept the units.So 3 times 4.All right let me be careful, that wasn'tpi over 2, that was pi over 12.This is a pi over 12 right over here.So you get pi over 12, times 3 times 2 squared, times dh dt.All of this is equal to 1.So now I'll switch to a neutral color.We get 1 is equal to, well 3 times 4 is 12,cancels out with that 12.We get one is equal to pi times dh dt.To solve for dh dt divide both sides by pi.And we get our drum roll now.The rate at which our height is changing with respectto time as we're putting 1 cubic centimeter of water per secondin.And right when our height is 2 centimeters high,the rate at which this height is changing with respect to timeis 1 over pi.And I haven't done the dimensional analysisbut this is going to be in centimeters per second.You can work through the dimensional analysisif you like by putting in the dimensions right over here.But there you have it.That's how fast our height is goingto be changing at exactly that moment.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-solving-related-rates-problems/v/speed-of-shadow-of-diving-bird	khanacademy	video	:00It's late at night, and some typeof nocturnal predatory bird, maybe this is an owl,is diving for its dinner.So this right over here is a mouse.And it's diving straight down near a street light.And let's get some information about what's going on.So the street light right over here is 20 feet high.So this is a 20 foot high street lamp.And right at this moment, the-- and Ihaven't drawn it completely to scale--the owl is 15 feet above the mouse.So this distance right over here is 15 feet.And the mouse itself is 10 feet from the base of the lamp.Let me draw that.So the mouse is 10 feet from the base of the lamp.And we also know-- we have our little radargun out-- we know that this owl is diving straight down.And right now, it is going 20 feet per second.So right now, this is going down at 20 feet per second.Now what we're curious about is we have the light over here.Light is coming from the street lamp in every direction.And it creates a shadow of the owl.So right now the shadow is out here.And as the owl goes further and further down,the shadow's going to move to the left like that.And so, given everything that we've set up right over here,the question is, at what rate is the shadow moving?So let's think about what we know and what we don't know.And to do that, let's set up some variables.So let me draw the same thing a little bit more geometrically.So let's say that this right over here is the street light.That is 20 feet tall.And then this right over here is the height of the owlright at this moment, so this is 15 feet.The distance between the base of the lampand where the owl is going, where that mouse is right now.This is 10 feet.And if I were to think about where the shadow is,well, the light's from right over here.And so the owl blocks the light right over there,so the shadow is going to be right over there.So if you just draw a straight line from the source of lightthrough the owl and you just keep goingand you hit the ground, you are goingto figure out where the shadow is.So the shadow is going to be right over here.It's going to be right over there.And we need to figure out how quickly is that moving.And it's going to be moving in the leftward direction.So let's set up some variables over here.So let's say-- so what's changing?Well, we know that the height of the owl is changing.So let's call that y.Right at this moment, it's equal to 15,but it is actually changing.And let's call the distance between the shadowand the mouse x.Now given this set up, can we come upwith a relationship between x and y?And then using that relationship, what we're reallytrying to come up with is, what is the rate at which xis changing with respect to time?We know what y is right at this moment.We know what dy/dt is right at this moment.Can we come up the relationship between x and yand maybe take the derivative with respectto t so we can figure out what dx/dtis at a given moment in time?Well, both of these triangles-- and whenI say both of these triangles, letme be clear what I'm talking about.This triangle right over here, the smaller triangle in green,is a similar triangle to the larger triangle.This is a similar triangle to this larger trianglethat I am tracing in blue.It's similar to this larger one.How do I know that?Well, they both have a right angle, right over here.They both share this angle.So all three-- they have two anglesin common-- then all three angles must be in common.So they are similar triangles, whichmeans the ratio between corresponding sidesmust be the same.So we know that the ratio of x to ymust be the ratio of this entire base, which is x plus 10,to the height of the larger triangle, to 20.And right there, we have a relationship between x and y.And if we take the derivative of both sides with respect to t,we're probably doing pretty well.Now before taking the derivative with respectto t-- I could do it right over here--just to simplify things a little bit,let me just cross multiply.So let me multiply both sides of this equation by 20and y, just so that I don't have as many thingsin the denominator.So on the left hand side it simplifies to 20x.I don't want to write over it, well, I'll just write-- 20x.And on the left hand side is 20 x.And then on the right hand side--let's see this cancels with that-- we have xy plus 10y.And now let me take the derivativeof both sides with respect to time.So the derivative of 20 times something with respect to timeis going to be the derivative of 20 times something with respectto the something, which is just 20.That's the derivative of 20x with respectto x, times dx or the derivative of x with respect to t,is equal to.Now over here we're going have to break outa little bit of the product rule.So first we want to figure out the derivativeof x with respect to time.So the derivative of the first thing times the second thing,times y.Plus just the first thing times the derivativeof the second thing.So derivative of y with respect to t is just dy/dt.And then finally, right over here.The derivative of 10y with respect to tis the derivative of 10y with respect to y, which is just 10,times the derivative of y with respect to t, which is dy/dt.And there you have it.You have your relationship between dx/dt, dy/dt, and xand y.So let's just make sure we have everything.This is what we're trying to solve for, dx/dt.And let's see here, we have another dx/dt here.We're going to try to solve for that.We know what y is. y is equal to 15.We know what dy/dt is, dy/dt.If we make the convention since y is decreasing,we can say it's -20.So we know what this is.And so if we just know what, so we know what this is.So if we just know what x is we can solve for dx/dt.So what is x right at this moment?Well, we can use this first equation--we could actually use this one up here,but this one is simplified a little bit-- to actually solvefor x.So let's do that, and then we'll substitute back into this thingwhere we've taken the derivative.So we get 20 times x is equal to x times y.y is 15.And just remember, I could have used this equation,but this is just one step further.We've already crossed multiplied.So it's x times y. y is 15.So it's x times 15, plus 10 times y.Plus 10 times 15.Did I do that right?20x is equal to x times 15 plus 10 times 15.So let's see if you subtract.So just this is 20x is equal to 15x, plus 150.Subtract 15x from both sides, youget 5x is equal to 30-- sorry, 5x is equal to 150,my brain is getting ahead.5x is equal to 150.Divide both sides by 5.You get x is equal to 30 feet.x is equal to 30 feet right at this moment.So this distance, just going back to our original diagram.This distance right over here is 30 feet.So let's substitute all the values we know backinto this equation to actually solve for dx/dt.So we have-- so let me do it right over here--we have 20 times dx/dt.I'll do that in orange, we'll solve for that.Actually no, I already used orange.So let's say dx/dt-- I'll use this pink-- 20 timesdx/dt is equal to dx/dt times y.y right now is 15 feet.So times 15, times-- I didn't want to do that color.Times 15 plus x, we already know that x is 30.Plus 30, times dy/dt.What is dy/dt?dy/dt, we could say is -20 feet per second. y is decreasing,the bird is the bird is diving down to get its dinner.So times negative-- well, times 20 feet per second.So that's that right over there.Plus 10 times dy/dt.So plus 10 times -20 feet per second.And now we just solve for dx/dt.So let's see, what do we have?We have 20 times-- let's see, let me subtract 15 dx/dt fromboth sides of this equation-- and we get 5dx/dt's.I just subtracted this from both sides of the equation.This is 15dx/dt this is 20.So that we have 5dx/dt's, is equal to thisis, this part right over here is -600.And this part right over here is -200.So it's equal to -800 feet per second-- or -800,and actually this will actually be in feet per second.And so dx/dt is equal to, dividing both sides by 5,5 times 16 is 80.So this is -160 feet per second.And we're done.And we see the shadow is moving very, very, very, veryfast to the left.x is decreasing, and we see that.That's why we have this negative sign here.The value of x is decreasing.It is moving to the left at quite a nice speed here.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-solving-related-rates-problems/v/rate-of-change-of-balloon-height	khanacademy	video	:00You're watching some type of hot air balloon show,and you're curious about how quickly one hot airballoon in particular is rising.And you have some information at your disposal.You know the spot on the ground that is directlybelow the hot air balloon.Let's say it took off from that point,it's just been going straight up ever since.And you know, you've measured it out,that you're 500 meters away from there.So you know that you are 500 meters away from that.And you're also able to measure the anglebetween the horizontal and the hot air balloon.You could do that with, I don't know,I'm not exactly a surveyor, but Iguess a viewfinder or something like that.So you're able to-- and I'm not sure if that's the right tool,but there are tools that you can measurethe angles between the horizontal and something that'snot on the horizontal.So you know that this angle right over hereis pi over 4 radians, or 45 degrees.We're going to keep it pi over 4,because when you take derivatives of trig functions,you assume that you're dealing with radians.So right over here, this is pi over 4 radians.And you also are able to measure the rate at which this angle ischanging.So this is changing at 0.2 radians per minute.Now my question to you, or the questionthat you're trying to figure out as you watch this hot airballoon, is how fast is it rising right now?How fast is it rising just as the anglebetween the horizontal and kind of the line between youand the hot air balloon is pi over 4 radians,and that angle is changing at 0.2 radians per minute?So let's think about what we knowand what we're trying to figure out.So we know a couple of things.We know that theta is equal to pi over 4if we call theta the angle right over here.So this is theta.We also know the rate at which data is changing.We know d theta.Let me do this in yellow.We know d theta dt is equal to 0.2 radians per minute.Now what are we trying to figure out?Well, we're trying to figure out the rate at whichthe height of the balloon is changing.So if you call this distance rightover here h, what we want to figure out is dh dt.That's what we don't know.So what we'd want to come up withis a relationship between dh dt, d theta dt, and maybe theta,if we need it.Or another way to think about it,if we can come up with the relationship between hand theta, then we could take the derivative with respectto t, and we'll probably get a relationship between allof this stuff.So what's the relationship between theta and h?Well, it's a little bit of trigonometry.We know we're trying to figure out h.We already know what this length is right over here.We know opposite over adjacent.That's the definition of tangent.So let's write that down.So we know that the tangent of thetais equal to the opposite side-- the opposite side isequal to h-- over the adjacent side, whichwe know is going to be a fixed 500.So there you have a relationship between theta and h.And then to figure out a relationship between d thetadt, the rate at which theta changes with respect to t,and the rate at which h changes with respect to t,we just have to take the derivativeof both sides of this with respect to t implicitly.So let's do that.And actually, let me move over this h over 500 a little bit.So let me move it over a little bitso I have space to show the derivative operator.So let's write it like that.And now let's take the derivative with respect to t.So d dt.I'm going to take the derivative with respect to t on the left.We're going to take the derivative with respectto t on the right.So what's the derivative with respectto t of tangent of theta?Well, we're just going to apply the chain rule here.It's going to be first the derivativeof the tangent of theta with respect to theta, which is justsecant squared of theta, times the derivative of thetawith respect to t, times d theta dt.Once again, this is just the derivativeof the tangent, the tangent of something with respectto that something times the derivativeof the something with respect to t.Derivative of tangent theta with respectto theta times the derivative theta with respect to tgives us the derivative of tangent of theta with respectto t, which is what we want when weuse this type of a derivative operator.We're taking the derivative with respect to t,not just the derivative with respect to theta.Fair enough.So this is the left hand side.And then the right hand side becomes, well,it's just going to be 1 over 500 dh dt.So 1 over 500 dh dt.We're literally saying it's just 1 over 500 timesthe derivative of h with respect to t.But now we have our relationship.We have the relationship that we actually care about.We have a relationship between the rate at which the height ischanging with respect to time and the rateat which the angle is changing with respect to timeand our angle at any moment.So we can just take these values up here, throw it in here,and then solve for the unknown.So let's do that.Let's do that right over here.So we get secant squared of theta.So we get secant squared.Right now our theta is pi over 4.Secant squared of pi over 4.Let me write those colors in to show youthat I'm putting these values in.Secant squared of pi over 4.Secant times d theta dt.Well, that is just 0.2.So times 0.2.And then this is going to be equal to 1 over 500.And we want to make sure.Since this is in radians per minute,we're going to get meters per.And this is meters right over here.We're going to get meters per minute right over here.We just want to make sure we know what our units are doing.I haven't written the units here to save some space.But we get 1 over 500 times dh dt.So if we want to solve for dh dt,we can multiply both sides by 500,and you get the rate at which our height is changingis equal to 500 times, let's see,secant squared of pi over 4.That is 1 over cosine squared of pi over 4.Let me write this over here.Cosine of pi over 4 is square root of 2 over 2.Cosine squared of pi over 4 is going to be equal to 2 over 4,which is equal to 1/2.And so secant squared of pi over 4 is just 1 over that,is equal to 2.So this is going to be equal to-- let me rewritethis instead of-- so the secant squared of pi over 4--let me erase this right over here.Secant squared of pi over 4, all of this business rightover here simplifies to 2.So times 2 times 0.2 times 0.2.So what is this going to be?This is going to be 500 times 0.4.So this is equal to 500 times-- let me justwrite a dot instead-- times 0.4, whichis equal to-- let me make sure I get this right.This would be with two 0's and one behind the decimal.Yep, there you go.It would be 200.So the rate at which our height is changing with respectto time right at that moment is 200 meters per minute.dh dt is equal to 200 meters per minute.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-approximation-with-local-linearity/v/local-linearization-intro	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that we're interested in approximating whatthe square root of 4.36 is equal to.So we want to figure apro, we want to figure outan approximation of this, and we don't have a calculator at hand.Well, one way to think about it is we knowwhat, we know what the square root of 4 is.We know that this is positive 2.The principle root of 4 is positive 2.So, okay, this is going to be a little bit more than two.Well, let's say that we wanna get a little bit moreaccurate, and so what I'm going to show you in this videois a method for doing that, for approximating the value ofa function near, near a value where we already know the value.So what am I talking about?So let's just imagine that we had the function.We have the function f of x is equal to the square root ofx, which is, of course, the same thing as x to the one-half power.So we know what f of 2 is.We know, we know that f of 2, I'm sorry, we know that f of 4 is.We know that f of 4 is the square root of 4, which isgoing to be equal to 2 or the principle root of 4, which isequal to positive 2 and what we want to approximate, we wanna figure outwhat f of, we wanna figure out what f of 4.36 is equal to.This is just another way of framing theexact same question that we started off this video.So let's just imagine our function.Let's just imagine it for a second.So, let me draw some axes.This is my y-axis.This is my, this is my x-axis, and let's graph y is equal to f of x.So let's say it looks something like this.Y equals f of x looks something like that.That's pretty decent.All right, so that's, that right there is y is equal tof of x, and we know f of 4 is equal to 2.F of 4 is equal to 2, so this is when x is equal to 4.I haven't drawn it really to scale, but hopefully, this is clear enough.So that right over here is going to be 2.That's f of 4.And what we wanna approximate is f of 4.36, so 4.36 might be right around, rightaround there, and so we want to approximate,we wanna approximate this y value right over here.We want to approximate that.Right over here is f of 4.36, and, onceagain, we're assuming we don't have a calculator at hand.So, how can we do that using what we know about derivatives?Well, what if we were to figure out an equation for the linethat is tangent to the point, to tangent to this point right over here.So the equation of the tangent line at x is equal to 4, and then we usethat linearization, that linearization defined to approximate values localto it, and this technique is called local linearization.So what I'm saying is, let's figure out what this, the equation of this line is.Let's call that l of x.And then we can use that to appro, andthen we can evaluate that at 4.36, and hopefullythat will be a little bit easier to dothan to try and figure out this right over here.So how would we do that?Well, one way to think about it, and obviously, there aremany ways to express a line, but one way to think about it is,okay, it's going to l of x is going to be f of 4, which is 2.It's going to be f of 4 plus the slope, the slope at, at x equals4, which is, of course, the derivative f prime of 4, sothat's going to be the slope of this line of l of x is f prime of 4.Let me make that clear.So this right over here is the slope.The slope when x is at, at x equals 4, sothis is a slope of this entire line, and so anyother point on this is gonna be f' of 4 plusthe slope times how far you are away from x equals 4.So it's going to be times x minus 4.Let's just, let's just validate that this makes sense.When we put 4.36 here, when we put 4.36 here, actually let mezoom in on this graph just to make things a little bit clearer.So, if this is, so I'm gonna do a zoom in.I'm gonna do a zoom in.I'm gonna try to zoom in into this region right over here.So, this is the point.This is the point (4, f of 4), and we are going to graph l of x.So let me do that.So this right over here is l of x.That's l of x.And let's say this, right over here, this right overhere, is the point (4.36, f of 4.36), and the waythat we're, we're gonna approximate this value is to figureout what, to figure out, what this value is right over here.And what is this one going to be?This right over here is going to be, this is going to be (4.36, L of 4.36).This line evaluated when x is equal to 4.36, and what is that going to be?What is that going to be equal to?Well, let's see.Let's just evaluate it.L of 4.36 is going to be f of 4.So, it's going to be 2 plus the derivative, so theslope of this line plus f prime of 4 times x minus 4.So, 4.36 minus 4 is going to be times 0.36, and that makes sense.You're starting at 2 and you're saying, okay, mychange in x, my change in x is 4.36.So, my change in y is going to be my slope times that changein x to get me that value, to get me that value right over there.So, let's figure out, let's figure out what this, let'sfigure out what this thing, what this thing actually is.So to do that, we need to figure out f prime of 4, so let's go back up here.I'll try to leave actually, I'll leave this little visualization here.So let's see, f prime, f prime of x is going to beone-half x to the negative one-half just using the power rule over here.So f prime of 4, f prime of 4 is equal to one-halftimes 4 to the negative one-half, which is, ofcourse, equal to one-half times one-half.4 to the one-half would be 2.4 to the negative one-half is going to be one-half.So, this is equal to 1 4th.So L of, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll now, L of 4.36 is equalto f of 4, is equal to f of 4, which is eq, let me just rewrite it.It's f of 4 plus f prime of 4 plus, gee, why am I switching to that color.Let me do the yellow.Plus f prime of 4, times, times,times, 4.36.4.36.Let me make this actually a new color, just so we see it.So, 4.36, so times 4.36 minus 4, minus4, and actually let me make all the 4s one color,too, so you see it's the same, so just like that.So what is this going to be?Well, this we already established is positive 2.This we already established, and we do this in a yellow color.This, we already established is 1 4th, and this part right over here is 0.36.So, this is going to be equal to 2 plus 1 4th times0.36, is 0.9 or is 0.09, so this is goingto be equal to, this is going to be equal to 2.09.So that is our approximation and should be atleast the way, based on how I graphed it, alittle higher than the actual value of the squareroot of 4.36, but we could write that up here.This is going to be approximately, let me just write it this way.The square root, I'll just write it down here.So we could say the square root of 4.36, which is the same thing as f of 4.36.This is approximately equal to 2.09.Now let's just say we happen to find a calculator, and justout of curiosity let's see how good of an approximation that is.Let's get a calculator out.And so, we wanna do the square root of 4.36, and we get 2.088.So, we actually, if we round to the nearest hundredths,we got a pretty good approximation just like we saw.In this, in this indicative graph right over here, it is,our approximation was indeed a little bit higher than the actual value.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-approximation-with-local-linearity/v/local-linearity-and-differentiability	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois explore the relationship between local linearityat a point and differentiability at a point.So local linearity is this idea that if we zoom insufficiently on a point,that even a non-linear function that is differentiableat that point will actually look linear.So let me show some examples of that.So let's say we had yis equal tox squared.So that's that there, clearly a non-linear function.But we can zoom in on a point,and if we zoom sufficiently in,we will see that it looks roughly linear.So let's say we wanna zoom in on the point one comma one,so let's do that.So zooming in on the point one comma one,already it is looking roughly linear at that point.And this property of local linearityis very helpfulwhen trying to approximate a function around a point.So for example, we could figure out,we could take the derivative at the point one one,use that as the slope of our tangent line,find the equation of the tangent line,and use that equation to approximate valuesof our function aroundx equals one.And you might not need to do thatfor y is equal to x squared,but it could actually be very very usefulfor a more complex function.But the big takeaway here,at the point one one,it is displaying this idea of local linearity,and it is also differentiable at that point.Now let's look at another exampleof a point on a functionwhere we aren't differentiable,and we also don't see the local linearity.So for example,let's do theabsolute value of x,and let me shift it over a little bitjust so that we don't overlap as much.Alright, so the absolute value of x minus one.It actually is differentiableas long as we're not at this corner right over here,as long as we're not at the point one comma zero.For any other x value, it is differentiable,but right at x equals one,we've talked in other videoshow we aren't differentiable there.And then we can use this local linearity ideato test it as well.And once again, this is not rigorous mathematics,but it is to give you an intuition.No matter how far we zoom in,we still see this sharp corner.It would be hard to construct the only tangent line,a unique line, that goes through this point one comma zero.I can construct an actual infinite number of linesthat go through one comma zerobut that do not go through the rest of the curve.And so notice,wherever you see a hard corner like we're seeingat one comma zero in this absolute value function,that's a pretty good indicationthat we are not going to be differentiableat that point.Now let's zoom out a little bit,and let's take another function.Let's take a function wherethe differentiability or the lack of differentiabilityis not because of a corner,but it's because as we zoom in,it starts to look linear,but it starts to look like a vertical line.So a good example of that would besquare root oflet's sayfour minus x squared.So that's the top half of a circle of radius two.And let's focus on the point two comma zero.Because right over there,we actually are not differentiable,and if we zoom in far enough,we see right at two comma zerothat we are approachingwhat looks like a vertical line.So once again,we would not be differentiable at two comma zero.Now another thing I wanna point out,all of these, you really didn't have to zoom in too muchto appreciate that hey I got a corner hereon this absolute value function,or at two comma zero, or at negative two comma zero,something a little bit stranger than normalis happening there, so maybe I'm not differentiable.But there are some functions that we don't see as typicallyin a algebra or precalculus or calculus class,but it can look like a hard cornerfrom a zoomed out perspective,but as we zoom in once again we'll see the local linearity,and they are also differentiable at those points.So a good example of that,let me actually get rid of some of thesejust so that we can really zoom in.Let's say y is equal to xto the, and I'm gonna make a very large exponent here,so x to the 10th power.It's starting to look at little bit like a corner there.Let's make it to the 100th power.Well now it's looking even more like a corner there.Let me go to the 1,000th power just for good measure.So at this scale,it looks like we have a corner at the pointone comma zero.Now this curve actually does not go to the pointone comma zero.If x is one,then y is going to be one,and we'll see that as we zoom in,this what looks like a hard corneris going to soften.And that's good because this functionis actually differentiable at every value of x.It's a little bit more exoticthat what we typically see,but as we zoom in, we'll actually see that.Let's just zoom in on what looks likea fairly hard corner,but if we zoom sufficiently enough,even at the part that looks like the hardest partof the corner,the real corner, we'll see that it starts to softenand it curves.And if we zoom in sufficiently,it will actually look like a line.It's hard to believe when you're really zoomed out,and I'm going at the point that really looked like a cornerfrom a distance.But as we zoom on in,we see once again this local linearitythat's a non-vertical line.And so once again, this is true at any point on this curve,that we are going to be differentiable.So the whole point here is,sometimes you might have to zoom in a lot,a tool like Desmos which I'm using right nowis very helpful for doing that.And this isn't rigorous mathematics,but it's to give you an intuitive sensethat if you zoom in sufficiently,and you start to see a curve looking more and morelike a line,good indication that you are differentiable.If you keep zooming in and it still lookslike a hard corner,of if you zoom in and it looks likethe tangent might be vertical,well then some questions should arise in your brain.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-approximation-with-local-linearity/v/linear-approximation-example	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So there are situationswhere you have some type of a function,this is clearly a nonlinear function.F of x is equal to one over x minus one,this is its graph or at least part of its graphright over here.But where you wanna approximate it with a linear functionespecially around a certain value,and so what we're going to do is,we wanna find an approximation, let me write this down,I wanna find an approximation for,actually meant to be clear, I wanna finda linear approximationso I'm gonna approximate it with a line.I wanna find a linear approximation, approximationof f, of f, around, and you need to knowwhere you're going to be approximating it,around x equals negative one.So what do we mean by that?Well let's look at this graph over here,on this curve, when x is equal to negative one,f of negative one is negative, is negative 1/2,which sticks us right over there, let me use a better color,so it's right over there and what we wanna dois approximate it with a line around that.And what we're essentially going to dois we're gonna approximate itwith the equation of the tangent line.The tangent line is going to look something,something like that and as we can see,as we get further and further from,from x equals negative one,the approximation gets worse and worsebut if we stay around x equals negative one,what's a decent, it is a, as good as you can getfor a linear approximation or at least in this exampleis a very good linear approximation.So when people say, hey, find the linear approximationof f around x equals negative oneor they say, what is the following is the best approximationand all of your choices are, are lines,well essentially, they're asking you to findthe equation of the tangent line at x equals negative one.So let's do that.So in order to find the equation of the tangent line,the equation of a line is y is equal to mx plus bwhere m is a slope and b is the y intercept.There's other ways that you could think about it.You could think about it, in terms of point slopewhere you could say, y minus some y that sits onthat line is equal to the slope times x minusthe corresponding x one, so x one comma y onesits on that line some place.Actually, I like to write this point slope formlike this sometimes, y minus y one over x minus x oneis equal to b because this comes asstraight out of the idea.Look, if x one and y one are on the line,the slope between any other point on the lineand that point is going to be your slope of your line.So we could think about it, any of these ways.So let's first find the slope of the tangent lineand that's where the derivative is useful.So f, actually let me just write f of x again,so I'm gonna write it as x minus oneto the negative one power, that makes ita little bit clearer that we can use the power ruleand a little bit of a chain rule,so the derivative of f with respect to x is equal to,so the derivative of x minus one of the negative onewith respect to x minus one, well that's just going to be,I'm just gonna use the power rule here,it's gonna be negative one times x minus oneto the negative two and then we're gonna multiply thattimes the derivative of x minus one with respect to x,well that's just going to be one, right.The derivative of x with respect of x is one,the derivative of negative one with respect to x is zero,so we could say times one here if we likeor we could just not write that'cause it don't change the value.And so let's evaluate that when x is equal to negative one.So f prime of negative one is equal to,I could just write this is, negative,all right like this way, negative one over negative oneminus one squared and so this is going to be negative twodown here, so this is equal to negative, negative 1/4.So, the slope of our tangent line is,so I could write this way, m is equal to negative one,negative 1/4 and so now, we just have to writeits equation down.So we already know, an x one and a y onethat sits on the line, in fact we want to usethe point when x is equals negative oneso we know that the point negative one comma,we could just input it right over here,f of negative one is negative 1/2,one over negative one minus one, negative 1/2.So we know that this negative one comma negative 1/2,that that is on our curve and it is on our line,that's the point at which the tangentand the curve actually intersect.And so we can use any of these,to now write the equation of our line,we could say, y, under right here,y minus y one, so minus negative 1/2is going to be equal to, is going to be equalto our slope, negative 1/4,I'm just using the point's slope version of our equation,is equal to our slope times x minus x one,so x minus or x squared that we know sits on this,so minus negative one.And so let me now write all of this in a neutral color,this will be y plus 1/2 is equal to, and I can,so this is gonna be plus one right over there,so I can distribute the negative 1/4.So it's negative 1/4 x minus 1/4 minus 1/4and then I can subtract 1/2 from both sidesso I'm gonna get y is equal to negative 1/4 xand then if I already am subtracting 1/4and I subtract another half is gonna be negative 3/4so minus three, minus 3/4.So, and that's actually pretty close to what I drew up here,this should be intersecting the y-axis at negative 3/4.So there you have it, this, this line,or you could even say, this equation,is going to be a very good linear approximation,about as good as you can get for a linear approximationfor that nonlinear function around x equals negative one.You might say, well why didn't they just ask meto find the equation of the tangent lineat x equals negative one, well they could havebut there's a little bit of extra cognitive processing here,we say, okay, I can actually use the equationof the tangent line at to approximatethis function around x equals negative one.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-lhpitals-rule/v/introduction-to-l-hopital-s-rule	khanacademy	video	:00Most of what we do early on when we first learn aboutcalculus is to use limits.We use limits to figure out derivatives of functions.In fact, the definition of a derivative usesthe notion of a limit.It's a slope around the point as we take the limit ofpoints closer and closer to the point in question.And you've seen that many, many, many times over.In this video I guess we're going to do it in theopposite direction.We're going to use derivatives to figure out limits.And in particular, limits that end up in indeterminate form.And when I say by indeterminate form I mean that when we justtake the limit as it is, we end up with something like 0/0, orinfinity over infinity, or negative infinity overinfinity, or maybe negative infinity over negativeinfinity, or positive infinity over negative infinity.All of these are indeterminate, undefined forms.And to do that we're going to use l'Hopital's rule.And in this video I'm just going to show you whatl'Hoptial's rule says and how to apply it because it's fairlystraightforward, and it's actually a very useful toolsometimes if you're in some type of a math competition andthey ask you to find a difficult limit that when youjust plug the numbers in you get something like this.L'Hopital's rule is normally what they are testing you for.And in a future video I might prove it, but that gets alittle bit more involved.The application is actually reasonably straightforward.So what l'Hopital's rule tells us that if we have-- and I'lldo it in abstract form first, but I think when I show youthe example it will all be made clear.That if the limit as x approaches c of f of x is equal to 0, andthe limit as x approaches c of g of x is equal to 0, and-- andthis is another and-- and the limit as x approaches c of fprime of x over g prime of x exists and it equals L.then-- so all of these conditions have to be met.This is the indeterminate form of 0/0, so thisis the first case.Then we can say that the limit as x approaches c off of x over g of x is also going to be equal to L.So this might seem a little bit bizarre to you right now, andI'm actually going to write the other case, and thenI'll do an example.We'll do multiple examples and the examples are goingto make it all clear.So this is the first case and the example we're going todo is actually going to be an example of this case.Now the other case is if the limit as x approaches c of f ofx is equal to positive or negative infinity, and thelimit as x approaches c of g of x is equal to positive ornegative infinity, and the limit of I guess you could saythe quotient of the derivatives exists, and the limit as xapproaches c of f prime of x over g prime of xis equal to L.Then we can make this same statement again.Let me just copy that out.Edit, copy, and then let me paste it.So in either of these two situations just to kind of makesure you understand what you're looking at, this is thesituation where if you just tried to evaluate this limitright here you're going to get f of c, which is 0.Or the limit as x approaches c of f of x over the limit asx approaches c of g of x.That's going to give you 0/0.And so you say, hey, I don't know what that limit is?But this says, well, look.If this limit exists, I could take the derivative of eachof these functions and then try to evaluate that limit.And if I get a number, if that exists, then they're goingto be the same limit.This is a situation where when we take the limit we getinfinity over infinity, or negative infinity or positiveinfinity over positive or negative infinity.So these are the two indeterminate forms.And to make it all clear let me just show you an examplebecause I think this will make things a lot more clear.So let's say we are trying to find the limit-- I'lldo this in a new color.Let me do it in this purplish color.Let's say we wanted to find the limit as x approaches0 of sine of x over x.Now if we just view this, if we just try to evaluate it at 0 ortake the limit as we approach 0 in each of these functions,we're going to get something that looks like 0/0.Sine of 0 is 0.Or the limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x is 0.And obviously, as x approaches 0 of x, that's alsogoing to be 0.So this is our indeterminate form.And if you want to think about it, this is our f of x, thatf of x right there is the sine of x.And our g of x, this g of x right there for thisfirst case, is the x.g of x is equal to x and f of x is equal to sine of x.And notice, well, we definitely know that this meets thefirst two constraints.The limit as x, and in this case, c is 0.The limit as x approaches 0 of sine of sine of x is 0, andthe limit as x approaches 0 of x is also equal to 0.So we get our indeterminate form.So let's see, at least, whether this limit even exists.If we take the derivative of f of x and we put that over thederivative of g of x, and take the limit as x approaches 0in this case, that's our c.Let's see if this limit exists.So I'll do that in the blue.So let me write the derivatives of the two functions.So f prime of x.If f of x is sine of x, what's f prime of x?Well, it's just cosine of x.You've learned that many times.And if g of x is x, what is g prime of x?That's super easy.The derivative of x is just 1.Let's try to take the limit as x approaches 0 of f prime of xover g prime of x-- over their derivatives.So that's going to be the limit as x approaches 0of cosine of x over 1.I wrote that 1 a little strange.And this is pretty straightforward.What is this going to be?Well, as x approaches 0 of cosine of x, that'sgoing to be equal to 1.And obviously, the limit as x approaches 0 of 1, that'salso going to be equal to 1.So in this situation we just saw that the limit as xapproaches-- our c in this case is 0.As x approaches 0 of f prime of x over g primeof x is equal to 1.This limit exists and it equals 1, so we've metall of the conditions.This is the case we're dealing with.Limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x is equal to 0.Limit as z approaches 0 of x is also equal to 0.The limit of the derivative of sine of x over the derivativeof x, which is cosine of x over 1-- we found thisto be equal to 1.All of these top conditions are met, so then we knowthis must be the case.That the limit as x approaches 0 of sine of x over xmust be equal to 1.It must be the same limit as this value right here where wetake the derivative of the f of x and of the g of x.I'll do more examples in the next few videos and I thinkit'll make it a lot more concrete.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-lhpitals-rule/v/l-hopital-s-rule-example-1	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say we need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of2 sine of x minus sine of 2x, all of that over xminus sine of x.Now, the first thing that I always try to do when I firstsee a limit problem is hey, what happens if I just try toevaluate this function at x is equal to 0?Maybe nothing crazy happens.So let's just try it out.If we try to do x equals 0, what happens?We get 2 sine of 0, which is 0.Minus sine of 2 times 0.Well, that's going to be sine of 0 again, which is 0.So our numerator is going to be equal to 0.Sine of 0, that's 0.And then we have another sine of 0 there.That's another 0, so all 0's.And our denominator, we're going to havea 0 minus sine of 0.Well that's also going to be 0.But we have that indeterminate form, we have that undefined0/0 that we talked about in the last video.So maybe we can use L'Hopital's rule here.In order to use L'Hopital's rule then the limit as xapproaches 0 of the derivative of this function overthe derivative of this function needs to exist.So let's just apply L'Hopital's rule and let's just take thederivative of each of these and see if we can find the limit.If we can, then that's going to be the limit of this thing.So this thing, assuming that it exists, is going to be equal tothe limit as x approaches 0 of the derivative of thisnumerator up here.And so what's the derivative of the numerator going to be?I'll do it in a new color.I'll do it in green.Well, the derivative of 2 sine of x is 2 cosine of x.And then, minus-- well, the derivative of sineof 2x is 2 cosine of 2x.So minus 2 cosine of 2x.Just use the chain rule there, derivative ofthe inside is just 2.That's the 2 out there.Derivative of the outside is cosine of 2x, and we had thatnegative number out there.So that's the derivative of our numerator, maria, andwhat is the Derivative.of our denominator?Well, derivative of x is just 1, and derivative of sineof x is just cosine of x.So 1 minus cosine of x.So let's try to evaluate this limit.What do we get?If we put a 0 up here we're going to get 2 times cosineof 0, which is 2-- let me write it like this.So this is 2 times cosine of 0, which is 1.So it's 2 minus 2 cosine of 2 times 0.Let me write it this way.Actually, let me just do it this way.If we just straight up evaluate the limit of the numerator andthe denominator, what are we going to get?We get 2 cosine of 0, which is 2.Minus 2 times cosine of-- well, this 2 times 0 isstill going to be 0.So minus 2 times cosine of 0, which is 2.All of that over 1 minus the cosine of 0, which is 1.So once again, we get 0/0.So does this mean that the limit doesn't exist?No, it still might exist, we might just want to doL'Hopital's rule again.Let me take the derivative of that and put it overthe derivative of that.And then take the limit and maybe L'Hopital's rulewill help us on the next [INAUDIBLE].So let's see if it gets us anywhere.So this should be equal to the limit if L'Hopital'srule applies here.We're not 100% sure yet.This should be equal to the limit as x approaches 0 of thederivative of that thing over the derivative of that thing.So what's the derivative of 2 cosine of x?Well, derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x.So it's negative 2 sine of x.And then derivative of cosine of 2x is negative 2 sine of 2x.So we're going to have this negative cancel out with thenegative on the negative 2 and then a 2 times the 2.So it's going to be plus 4 sine of 2x.Let me make sure I did that right.We have the minus 2 or the negative 2 on the outside.Derivative of cosine of 2x is going to be 2 timesnegative sine of x.So the 2 times 2 is 4.The negative sine of x times-- the negativeright there's a plus.You have a positive sine, so it's the sine of 2x.That's the numerator when you take the derivative.And the denominator-- this is just an exercise intaking derivatives.What's the derivative of the denominator?Derivative of 1 is 0.And derivative negative cosine of x is just-- well,that's just sine of x.So let's take this limit.So this is going to be equal to-- well, immediately if Itake x is equal to 0 in the denominator, I know thatsine of 0 is just 0.Let's see what happens in the numerator.Negative 2 times sine of 0.That's going to be 0.And then plus 4 times sine of 2 times 0.Well, that's still sine of 0, so that's still going to be 0.So once again, we got indeterminate form again.Are we done?Do we give up?Do we say that L'Hopital's rule didn't work?No, because this could have been our first limit problem.And if this is our first limit problem we say, hey, maybe wecould use L'Hopital's rule here because we got anindeterminate form.Both the numerator and the denominator approach0 as x approaches 0.So let's take the derivatives again.This will be equal to-- if the limit exist, thelimit as x approaches 0.Let's take the derivative of the numerator.The derivative of negative 2 sine of x is negative2 cosine of x.And then, plus the derivative of 4 sine of 2x.Well, it's 2 times 4, which is 8.Times cosine of 2x.Derivative of sine of 2x is 2 cosine of 2x.And that first 2 gets multiplied by the4 to get the 8.And then the derivative of the denominator, derivative of sineof x is just cosine of x.So let's evaluate this character.So it looks like we've made some headway or maybeL'Hopital's rule stop applying here because we take the limitas x approaches 0 of cosine of x.That is 1.So we're definitely not going to get that indeterminate form,that 0/0 on this iteration.Let's see what happens to the numerator.We get negative 2 times cosine of 0.Well that's just negative 2 because cosine of 0 is 1.Plus 8 times cosine of 2x.Well, if x is 0, so it's going to be cosine of 0, which is 1.So it's just going to be an 8.So negative 2 plus 8.Well this thing right here, negative 2 plus 8 is 6.6 over 1.This whole thing is equal to 6.So L'Hopital's rule-- it applies to this last step.If this was the problem we were given and we said, hey, when wetried to apply the limit we get the limit as this numeratorapproaches 0 is 0.Limit as this denominator approaches 0 is 0.As the derivative of the numerator over the derivativeof the denominator, that exists and it equals 6.So this limit must be equal to 6.Well if this limit is equal to 6, by the same argument, thislimit is also going to be equal to 6.And by the same argument, this limit has got toalso be equal to 6.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-lhpitals-rule/v/l-hopital-s-rule-example-2	khanacademy	video	:00We need to evaluate the limit, as x approaches infinity, of 4xsquared minus 5x, all of that over 1 minus 3x squared.So infinity is kind of a strange number.You can't just plug in infinity and see what happens.But if you wanted to evaluate this limit, what you might tryto do is just evaluate-- if you want to find the limit as thisnumerator approaches infinity, you put in really large numbersthere, and you're going to see that it approaches infinity.That the numerator approaches infinity asx approaches infinity.And if you put really large numbers in the denominator,you're going to see that that also-- well,not quite infinity.3x squared will approach infinity, but we'resubtracting it.If you subtract infinity from some non-infinite number, it'sgoing to be negative infinity.So if you were to just kind of evaluate it at infinity,the numerator, you would get positive infinity.The denominator, you would get negative infinity.So I'll write it like this.Negative infinity.And that's one of the indeterminate formsthat L'Hopital's Rule can be applied to.And you're probably saying, hey, Sal, why are we evenusing L'Hopital's Rule?I know how to do this without L'Hopital's Rule.And you probably do, or you should.And we'll do that in a second.But I just wanted to show you that L'Hopital's Rule alsoworks for this type of problem, and I really just wanted toshow you an example that had a infinity over negativeor positive infinity indeterminate form.But let's apply L'Hopital's Rule here.So if this limit exists, or if the limit of their derivativesexist, then this limit's going to be equal to the limit as xapproaches infinity of the derivative of the numerator.So the derivative of the numerator is-- the derivativeof 4x squared is 8x minus 5 over-- the derivative of thedenominator is, well, derivative of 1 is 0.Derivative of negative 3x squared is negative 6x.And once again, when you evaluated infinity, thenumerator is going to approach infinity.And the denominator is approaching negative infinity.Negative 6 times infinity is negative infinity.So this is negative infinity.So let's apply L'Hopital's Rule again.So if the limit of these guys' derivatives exist-- or therational function of the derivative of this guy dividedby the derivative of that guy-- if that exists, then thislimit's going to be equal to the limit as x approachesinfinity of-- arbitrarily switch colors-- derivativeof 8x minus 5 is just 8.Derivative of negative 6x is negative 6.And this is just going to be-- this is just a constant here.So it doesn't matter what limit you're approaching, this isjust going to equal this value.Which is what?If we put it in lowest common form, or simplifiedform, it's negative 4/3.So this limit exists.This was an indeterminate form.And the limit of this function's derivative over thisfunction's derivative exists, so this limit must alsoequal negative 4/3.And by that same argument, that limit also must beequal to negative 4/3.And for those of you who say, hey, we alreadyknew how to do this.We could just factor out an x squared.You are absolutely right.And I'll show you that right here.Just to show you that it's not the only-- you know,L'Hopital's Rule is not the only game in town.And frankly, for this type of problem, my first reactionprobably wouldn't have been to use L'Hopital's Rule first.You could have said that that first limit-- so the limit as xapproaches infinity of 4x squared minus 5x over 1 minus3x squared is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity.Let me draw a little line here, to show you that this is equalto that, not to this thing over here.This is equal to the limit as x approaches infinity.Let's factor out an x squared out of the numeratorand the denominator.So you have an x squared times 4 minus 5 over x.Right? x squared times 5 over x is going to be 5x.Divided by-- let's factor out an x out of the numerator.So x squared times 1 over x squared minus 3.And then these x squareds cancel out.So this is going to be equal to the limit as x approachesinfinity of 4 minus 5 over x over 1 over x squared minus 3.And what's this going to be equal to?Well, as x approaches infinity-- 5 divided byinfinity-- this term is going to be 0.Super duper infinitely large denominator,this is going to be 0.That is going to approach 0.And same argument.This right here is going to approach 0.All you're left with is a 4 and a negative 3.So this is going to be equal to negative 4 over anegative 3, or negative 4/3.So you didn't have to do use L'Hopital's Rulefor this problem.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-lhpitals-rule/v/lhopitals-rule-to-solve-for-variable	khanacademy	video	":00- We have an interesting problem or exercise here.Find a such that the limit as x approaches zeroof the square route of four plus xminus the square route of fourminus a times x,all of that over x, is equal to 3/4.And like always, I encourage youto pause the video and give a go at it.So assuming you have had your go,now let's do this together.So when you just try to superficiallyevaluate this limit here, if x approaches zero,so if you're just trying to evaluatethis one x equals zero, you're going to get...let me just try to evaluate the limit.As x approaches zeroof the square route of four plus xminus the square route of four minus ax,all of that over x.Well, this right over here is going to bejust the principal root of four,because four plus zero is four.This right over here is just going to bethe principal root of four,because no matter what a is,a times zero is going to be zero,so you're going to be left with four minus zero,so it's just the principal route of four.So you're going to have two.This whole thing is going to be two.If you just were to substitute x there,so this whole thing is two.This whole thing right over hereis going to be two as well.You're going to have two minus two,and then as x approaches zero,this is going to be zero.So this looks like we are going...we are getting an indeterminate form.And when you get to something like this,you start to say, ""Well, L'Hopital's rule might apply.""If I get zero over zero, or infinity over infinity,well, this limit is going to be the same thingas the limit as x approaches zero.This is going to be the same thingas the limit as x approaches zeroof the derivative of the numeratorover the derivative of the denominator.So what is the derivative of the numerator?Actually, let me just do the derivativeof the denominator first,because the derivative of x, with respect...Oh, I may have to do that in a different color.The derivative of x with respect to xis just going to be one.But now let me take the derivativeof this business up here.The derivative...The derivative of this with respect to x.So this is four plus x to the 1/2 power.So this is, the derivative of this partis going to be 1/2 times fourplus x to the negative 1/2 power.And so the derivative of this part right over here...Let's see, here the...The chain rule applied here with a derivativeof four plus x is just one, so we justmultiply this thing by one.But here the chain rule, the derivative offour minus ax, with respect to x, is negative a.Now we multiply that, and we're going to havethis negative out front, so this is going to beplus a.Plus a times...times 1/2times four minus axto the negative 1/2 power.I just used the power rule and the chain ruleto take the derivative here.And so what is is this going to be?Well, this is going to be equal to...This is going to be equal to something over one.So we have up here, as x approaches zero,this is going to be, this part, four plus zerois just four to the negative 1/2 power.Well, that's just going to be 1/2.Four to the 1/2 is two,four to the negative 1/2 is 1/2.And then as x approaches zero here,this is going to be four to the negative 1/2,which is once again 1/2.So what does this simplify to?We have 1/2 times 1/2, which is 1/4.That's that there.And then over here I have a times 1/2 times 1/2,so that's going to be plus a over four,and so this is the same thing as justa plus one over four.And we say that this needs to be equal to 3/4.This needs to be equal to 3/4.That was our original problem.So that needs to be equal to 3/4,and now it's pretty straightforwardto figure out what a needs to be.A plus one needs to be equal to three,or a is equal to 2.And we are done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-derivatives/cs1-lhpitals-rule/v/proof-of-special-case-of-l-hopital-s-rule	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to go over in this videois a special case of L'Hopital's Rule.And it's a more constrained versionof the general case we've been looking at.But it's still very powerful and very applicable.And the reason why we're going to go over this special caseis because its proof is fairly straightforwardand will give you an intuition for why L'Hopital's Rule worksat all.So the special case of L'Hopital's Ruleis a situation where f of a is equal to 0.f prime of a exists.g of a is equal to 0.g prime of a exists.If these constraints are met, then the limit,as x approaches a of f of x over g of x,is going to be equal to f prime of a over g prime of a.So it's very similar to the general case.It's little bit more constrained.We're assuming that f prime of a exists.We're not just taking the limit now.We're assuming f prime of a and g prime of a actually exist.But notice if we substitute a right over here we get 0/0.But that if the derivatives existwe could just evaluate the derivatives at a,and then we get the limit.So this is very close to the general caseof L'Hopital's Rule.Now let's actually prove it.And to prove it, we're going to start with the right handand then show that if we use the definition of derivatives,we get the left hand right over here.So let me do that.So I'll do it right over here.So f prime of a is equal to what,by the definition of derivatives?Well, we could view that as the limitas x approaches a of f of x minus f of a over x minus a.So this is literally just a slope between two points.So like, if you have your function f of x like this,this is the point a, f of a right over here.This right over here is the point x, f of x.This expression right over here isthe slope between these two points.The change in our y value is f of x minus f of a.The change in our f value is x minus a.So this expression is just the slope of this line.And we're just taking the-- let me actuallydo that in a different color-- the line thatconnects these two points, that's the slope of it.I'll do that in white.The slope of the line that connects those two points.And we're taking the limit as x getscloser and closer and closer to a.So this is just another way of writingthe definition of the derivative.So that's fine.Let's do the same thing for g prime of a.So f prime of a over g prime of a,is going to be this business which is in orange,f prime of a over g prime of a.Which we can write as the limit as x approachesa of g of x minus g of a over x minus a.Well, in the numerator, we're taking the limitas x approaches a, and in the denominator,we're taking the limit as x approaches a.So we can just rewrite this.This we can rewrite as the limit as x approachesa of all this business in orange.f of x minus f of a, over x minus a,over all the business in green.g of x minus g of a, all of that over x minus a.Now, to simplify this, we can multiply the numeratorand the denominator by x minus a to get rid of these x minusa's.So let's do that.Let's multiply by x minus a over x minus a.So the numerator, x minus a, and we're dividing by x minus a.Those cancel out.And then these two cancel out.And we're left with this thing over here is equal to the limitas x approaches a of, in the numeratorwe have f of x minus f of a.And in the denominator, we have g of x minus g of a.And I think you see where this is going.What is f(a) equal to?Well, we assumed f of a is equal to 0.That's why we're using L'Hopital's Rulefrom the get go. f of a is equal to 0, g of a is equal to 0.f of a is equal to 0. g of a is equal to 0.And this simplifies to the limit as x approaches a of fprime of x, sorry of f of x, we've got to be careful.Of f of x over g of x.So we just showed that if f of a equals 0, g of a equals 0,and these two derivatives exist, then the derivatives evaluatedat a over each other are going to be equal to the limitas x approaches a of f of x over g of x.Or the limit as x approaches a of fof x over g of x is going to be equal to f prime of a over gprime of a.So fairly straightforward proof for the special case--the special case, not the more general case--of L'Hopital's Rule.

would like to tackle in this videois what I consider to be a particularlyinteresting limits problem.Let's say we want to figure out the limitas X approaches zero from the positive directionof sine of X.This is where it's about to get interesting.Sine of X to the one overthe natural log of X powerand I encourage you to pause this videoand see if you can have a go at itfully knowing that thisis a little bit of a tricky exercise.I'm assuming you have attempted.Some of you might have been able to figure outon the first pass.I will tell you that the first timethat I encountered something like this,I did not figure it out at the first passso definitely do not feel badif you fall into that second category.What many of you all probably didis you said okay, let me think about it.Let me just think about the components here.If I were to think about the limit,if I were to think about the limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction of sine of X,well that's pretty straightforward.That's going to be zero,so you could think of like this part of itis going to approach zero but then if you say,and you could say, I guess I should say.The limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction of one overnatural log of Xand this is why we have to think about itfrom the positive direction.It doesn't make sense to approach itfrom the negative direction.You can't take the natural logof a negative number.That's not in the domain for the natural logbut as you get closer and closer to zerofrom the negative direction,the natural log of those values,you have to raise Eto more larger and larger negative values.This part over here is going to approachnegative infinity.It's going to go to negative infinity.One over negative infinity,one divided by super largeor large magnitude negative numbers,well, that's just going to approach zero.You could say that this right over hereis also going to be,is also going to be equal to zero.That doesn't seem to help us muchbecause if this thing is going to zeroand that thing is going to zero,it's kind of an implication that wellmaybe this whole thing is going to zeroto the zero power but we don't really know what zero,let me do the some, those color.Zero to thezero power but this is one of those greatfun things to think about in mathematics.There's justifications why this could be zero,justifications why this could be one.We don't really know what to make of this.This isn't really a satisfying answer.Something at this pointmight be going into your brain.We have this thing that we've been exposedto called L'Hopital's rule.If you have not been exposed to it,I encourage you to watch the video,the introductory video on L'Hopital's rule.In L'Hopital's rule, let me just write it down.L'Hopital's rulehelps us out with situations wherewhen we try to superficially evaluate the limit,we get indeterminate formsthings like zero over zero.We get infinity over infinity.We get negative infinity over negative infinityand we go into much more detail into that video.It seems this is kind of,it feels like we're getting a zero to a zero.It's kind of we're getting the strange beastand at least evokes the notion of L'Hopital's rule.You will not be, as we'll see in a few seconds,you're not wrong to, for thatL'Hopital's rule neuron to be triggering in your brainalthough you can't apply it directlyto this right over here.L'Hopital's rule does not apply toor directly apply to the zero to the zero formbut what we can do is construct a problemwhere L'Hopital's rule will applyand then use that to solve, to figure outwhat this is going to be.This was essentially the tricky part of this exercise.Well what do I mean?Well if we set Yequal to Y ofand maybe let me write it this way.If we set, and I'll write Y,I could just write Y but I'll say Yis clearly a function of X.If we say Y of X is going to be sine of X,sine of X to the one overnatural log of X.This thing right over here is essentially sayingwhat's the limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction of Yand once again we don't know.Maybe it's zero to the zerobut we don't know what zero to zero actually is.What we could do, what we could doand this is a trick that you see a lotand anytime you get kind of weird things with exponentsand whether you're doing limits or derivatives,as you'll see it's often times usefulto take the natural log of both sides.Well what happens if you take the natural logof both sides here?On the left-hand sideyou're going to have the natural log,the natural log, and whenever I think of natural logand E the way I always think about them,the color green for some bizarre reasonbut we'll say the natural log of Yis equal to.If you take the natural log of this thing,actually let me just, I don't want to skip steps herebecause this is interesting.This is going to be the natural logof all of this business of sine of X,let me write this way.Sine of X,sine, I want to do this in that orange color.The natural log ofsine of X to the oneover the natural log of X.Well we know from our exponent priorour logarithm properties,the logarithm of something to a power,that's the same thing as the power.One over natural log of Xtimes the logarithm, this case the natural logarithmof whatever taking the sine of X here.Sine of Xor we could say the natural log of Y.Want to keep, stay color consistentfor at least one more step.The natural log of Y is equal to,if we just rewrite thisthis is going to be the natural logof sine of X,the natural logof sine of Xover the natural log of X.Well this is all interestingbut why do we care about this?Why did I do this?Well instead of thinking about what is the limit?What is the limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction of Y?Let's think about what the natural log of Yis approaching as we approach,as X approaches zero from the positive direction.Let's figure out what the limit of this expressionright over here is as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction.What is a natural log of Y?What is this whole thing?Not Y, what is the natural log of Y approaching?Let's think about that scenario.Let me write, do this in a new color.We want to figure out what is the limitas X approaches zero from the positive directionof this business and I'll just write it in one color.The natural logof sine of Xover the natural log of X.I don't know, I wrote one time in print,one time in cursive.I'll just be consistent right over there.Now why is this interesting?Let's see in the numerator here,this thing's going to approach zero,natural log of zero you're going to approachnegative infinity.This thing right over here natural log of,as you approach it from the positive direction.Once again you're going to approach negative infinity.This gives you that indeterminate form.This is giving youthat indeterminate form of negative infinityover negative infinity which is neatbecause this triggers or at least tells usthat L'Hopital's rule may be appropriate here.We could say that this is going to be equal tothe limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction.Let me give myself a little bit morereal estate to work up withand I can take the derivative of the numeratorand the derivative of the denominator.Derivative of the numerator,so the derivative of the numerator,I'm going to apply the chain rule here.Derivative of sine of X is cosine of Xand then the derivative,the natural log of sine of X with respectto sine of X is going to be one over sine of X.This is going to be over sine of X,so that's the derivative of the numerator.Then the derivative of the denominatoris just going to be one over X,one over X.This is all going to be equal to,this is equal to the limitas X approaches zero from the positive directionof I could write this as cosine of X,cosine of X.Let's see,if I'm dividing by X.I'm dividing by X, I am going to get,this is going to be X over sine of X,X over sine of X.When I applyand when I try to take the limit hereI'm going to get a zero,once again we got a zero over zero.This doesn't feel too satisfyingbut once again this is where our limit propertiesmight be useful.As you can tell, this is not the mosttrivial of problemsbut this is going to be the same thingand this will take a little bit of pattern recognition.This is the same thing asbecause we know that the limit of the productof two functionsis equal to the product of their limits,this is the same thing as the limit,the limit as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction of,if we take this part,let me do this in a different color.If we take this part,that's not a different color.If we take this part right over here,so that's going to be X over sine of Xand then times the limit.Let me put parenthesis heretimes the limit,the limitas X approaches zero from the positive directionof cosine of X,of cosine of X.Now this thing right over hereis pretty straightforward.You can just evaluate it at zero,you get one.This thing right over here is equal to onebut what's this thing?This might ring a bell.You might have seen the limit as X approaches zero,of sine of X over X.This is just the reciprocal of that.This is X over sine of Xbut when you just superficially try to evaluate it.You get zero over zero so you can then applyL'Hopital's rule to this thing.Once again this is quite an interesting scenariowe find ourselves in.This is going to be the same thing as the limitas X approaches zero from the positive direction.Derivative at the top is one,derivative at the bottom, is cosine of X.Well, this is just going to be one overcosine of zero is one,so this is just going to be equal to one.We got to apply L'Hopital's rule againand realize that this limit is going to be equal to one.One times one is oneso this thing right over here is equal to one.This thing right over here,this thing right over here is going to be,this thing right over here is going to approach onewhich tells you that this thing is approaching one.What do we now know?We now know and I'll write it out in language.We now know that the limitof the natural log of Y,the limit of the natural log of Yas X approaches zero from the positive directionis equal to one.If the natural log of Y is approaching one,what is Y approaching?Well in order for the natural log, so once againwe just know this thing right over here.We know this thing is oneand this thing is a natural log of Y.We now know that this thing,the limit as X approaches zero of this thingis one and that's the same thing as a limitas X approaches zero from the positive directionof the natural log of Y.These things are equivalent, is equal to one.Well the natural log of Y is approaching oneso if the natural log of Yis approaching, let me write it this way.The natural log of Y is approaching one.Well what must Y be approaching?Well to get the natural log of somethingthat gets you one, well Y must be approaching Ebecause natural log of E is one.Then Y must be approaching Eand we are done because that's what we cared about.We cared about what is Y, this is Y, remember,we defined this whole thing as Y.We said what is Y approachingas X approaches zero from the positive direction?Well we figured out that the natural log of Yis approaching one as X approaches zerofrom the positive direction.That means that Y must be approaching E.This tells us that this thing,this thing right over hereis equal to Ewhich is somewhat mind blowing.We seen other, the E is popping upand it's involving sine of Xand of course natural log of X,you expect E to be involved somehow.It is a pretty fascinating problem in my mind.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/mean-value-theorem-1	khanacademy	video	:00Let's see if we can give ourselvesan intuitive understanding of the mean value theorem.And as we'll see, once you parse some of the mathematical lingoand notation, it's actually a quite intuitive theorem.And so let's just think about some function, f.So let's say I have some function f.And we know a few things about this function.We know that it is continuous over the closedinterval between x equals a and x is equal to b.And so when we put these brackets here,that just means closed interval.So when I put a bracket here, thatmeans we're including the point a.And if I put the bracket on the right hand side insteadof a parentheses, that means that weare including the point b.And continuous just means we don'thave any gaps or jumps in the function over this closedinterval.Now, let's also assume that it's differentiable overthe open interval between a and b.So now we're saying, well, it's OKif it's not differentiable right at a,or if it's not differentiable right at b.And differentiable just means that there'sa defined derivative, that you can actuallytake the derivative at those points.So it's differentiable over the open interval between a and b.So those are the constraints we'regoing to put on ourselves for the mean value theorem.And so let's just try to visualize this thing.So this is my function, that's the y-axis.And then this right over here is the x-axis.And I'm going to-- let's see, x-axis,and let me draw my interval.So that's a, and then this is b right over here.And so let's say our function looks something like this.Draw an arbitrary function right over here,let's say my function looks something like that.So at this point right over here, the x value is a,and the y value is f(a).At this point right over here, the x valueis b, and the y value, of course, is f(b).So all the mean value theorem tellsus is if we take the average rate of changeover the interval, that at some pointthe instantaneous rate of change, at leastat some point in this open interval,the instantaneous change is goingto be the same as the average change.Now what does that mean, visually?So let's calculate the average change.The average change between point a and point b,well, that's going to be the slope of the secant line.So that's-- so this is the secant line.So think about its slope.All the mean value theorem tells usis that at some point in this interval,the instant slope of the tangent lineis going to be the same as the slope of the secant line.And we can see, just visually, it looks like right over here,the slope of the tangent line is it looks like the sameas the slope of the secant line.It also looks like the case right over here.The slope of the tangent line is equal to the slopeof the secant line.And it makes intuitive sense.At some point, your instantaneous slopeis going to be the same as the average slope.Now how would we write that mathematically?Well, let's calculate the average slopeover this interval.Well, the average slope over this interval,or the average change, the slope of the secant line,is going to be our change in y-- our change in yright over here-- over our change in x.Well, what is our change in y?Our change in y is f(b) minus f(a),and that's going to be over our change in x.Over b minus b minus a.I'll do that in that red color.So let's just remind ourselves what's going on here.So this right over here, this is the graph of yis equal to f(x).We're saying that the slope of the secant line,or our average rate of change over the interval from a to b,is our change in y-- that the Greek letter delta is justshorthand for change in y-- over our change in x.Which, of course, is equal to this.And the mean value theorem tells usthat there exists-- so if we know these twothings about the function, then thereexists some x value in between a and b.So in the open interval between a and b, there exists some c.There exists some c, and we couldsay it's a member of the open interval between a and b.Or we could say some c such that a is less than c,which is less than b.So some c in this interval.So some c in between it where the instantaneous rateof change at that x value is the sameas the average rate of change.So there exists some c in this open intervalwhere the average rate of change isequal to the instantaneous rate of change at that point.That's all it's saying.And as we saw this diagram right over here, this could be our c.Or this could be our c as well.So nothing really-- it looks, youwould say f is continuous over a, b, differentiable over-- fis continuous over the closed interval, differentiableover the open interval, and you see all this notation.You're like, what is that telling us?All it's saying is at some point in the interval,the instantaneous rate of change isgoing to be the same as the average rate of changeover the whole interval.In the next video, we'll try to give youa kind of a real life example about when that make sense.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/finding-where-the-derivative-is-equal-to-the-average-change	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say I have some function f of xthat is defined as being equal to x squared minus 6x plus 8for all x.And what I want to do is show that for this functionwe can definitely find a c in an interval wherethe derivative at the point c is equal to the average rateof change over that interval.So let's give ourselves an interval right over here.Let's say we care about the interval between 2 and 5.And this function is definitely continuous over this closedinterval, and it's also differentiable over it.And it just has to be differentiableover the open interval, but this is differentiable reallyfor all x.And so let's show that we can finda c that's inside the open interval, that'sa member of the open interval, that'sin the open interval such that the derivative at cis equal to the average rate of change over this interval.Or is equal to the slope of the secant line between the twoendpoints of the interval.So it's equal to f of 5 minus f of 2 over 5 minus 2.And so I encourage you to pause the video now and tryto find a c where this is actually true.Well to do that, let's just calculate what this has to be.Then let's just take the derivative and set them equaland we should be able to solve for our c.So let's see f of 5 minus f of 2, f of 5 is, let's see, f of 5is equal to 25 minus 30 plus 8.So that's negative 5 plus 8 is equal to 3.f of 2 is equal to 2 squared minus 12.So it's 4 minus 12 plus 8.That's going to be a 0.So this is equal to 3/3, which is equal to 1.f prime of c needs to be equal to 1.And so what is the derivative of this?Well let's see, f prime of x is equal to 2x minus 6.And so we need to figure out at what x value,especially it has to be in this open interval,at what x value is it equal to 1?So this needs to be equal to 1.So let's add 6 to both sides.You get 2x is equal to 7.x is equal to 7/2, which is the same thing as 3 and 1/2.So it's definitely in this interval right over here.So we've just found our c is equal to 7/2.And let's just graph this to really make surethat this makes sense.So this right over here is our y-axis.And then this right over here is our x-axis.Looks like all the action is happeningin the first and fourth quadrants.So that is our x-axis.And let's see, let's say this is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.So we already know that 2 is one of the zeroes here.So we know that our function if we wanted to graph it,it intersects the x-axis right over here.And you can factor this out as x minus 2 times x minus 4.So the other place where our function hits 0is when x is equal to 4 right over here.Our vertex is going to be right in between at x is equal to 3.When x is equal to 3, let's see, 9 minus 18 is negative 9plus 8, so negative 1.So you have the point 3, negative 1 on it.And so that's enough for us to graph.And we also know at 5, we're at 3.So 1, 2, 3.So at 5, we are right over here.So over the interval that we care about,our graph looks something like this.So that's the interval that we care about.And we're saying that we were lookingfor a c whose slope is the same as the slopeof the secant line, same as the slopeof the line between these two points.And if I were to just visually look at it, I'd say well yeah,it looks like right around there just based on my drawing,the slope of the tangent line looks like it's parallel.It looks like it has the same slope,looks like the tangent line is parallel to the secant line.And that looks like it's right at 3 and 1/2 or 7/2.So it makes sense.So this right over here is our c. c is equal to 7/2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/mean-value-theorem-example-square-root	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let f of x be equal to the square rootof four x minus three, and let c be the numberthat satisfies the mean value theorem for fon the closed interval between one and three,or one is less than or equal to xis less than or equal to three.What is c?So let's just remind ourselves what it means for c to bethe number that satisfies the mean value theorem for f.This means that over this interval, c is a point,x equals c is a point where the slope of the tangent lineat x equals c, so I could write f prime of c,so that is the slope of the tangent linewhen x is equal to c, this is equalto the slope of the secant linethat connects these two points.So this is going to be equal to,see the slope of the secant line that connectsthe points three, f of three, and one, f of one.So it's going to be f of three minus f of oneover three minus one.And if you wanted to think about what this means visually,it would look something like this.So if this is our x axisand this is one, two,actually let me spread it out a little bit more.One, two, and three.And so you have one, comma, f of one, right over there,so that is at the point one, comma, f of one,and we could evaluate that, actually,that's one, comma, one.So that's gonna be the point one, comma, one.And then you have the point three, comma,let's see, you're gonna have four times three is 12minus three is nine, so it's gonna be three, comma, three.So maybe it's right over there, three, comma, three,and the curve might look something like this,so it might look something like that,so if you think about the slope of the linethat connects these two points,so this line that connects those two points,all the mean value theorem,I'm doing a different color.All the mean value theorem tells us is thatthere's a point between one and three wherethe slope of the tangent line has the exact same slope.So if I were to eyeball it,it looks like it's right around there,although we are actually going to solve for it.So, some point where the slope of the tangent lineis equal to the slope of the linethat connects these two end pointsand their corresponding function values.So that is c, that would be c right over there.So really we just have to solve this.So let's first just find out what f prime of x is,and then we could substitute a c in thereand then we can evaluate this on the right hand side.So I'm gonna rewrite f of x,f of x is equal to, and I'm gonna write itas four x to the minus three to the one half power.Makes it a little bit more obvious that we can applythe power rule and the chain rule here.So f prime of x is going to be the derivativeof four x minus three to the one halfwith respect to four x minus three,so that is going to be one half times four xminus three to the negative one half,and then we're gonna multiply thattimes the derivative of four xminus three with respect to x.Well, derivative of four x with respect to x is just four,and the derivative of negative three with respect to x,well that's just gonna be zero,so the derivative of four x minus threewith respect to x is four.So times four.so f prime of xis equal to four times one half,which is two, over the square root of four x minus three.Four x minus three to the one halfwould just be the square root of four x minus three,but it's the negative one half,so we're gonna put it in the denominator right over here.And so f prime of c, we could rewrite thisas two over the square root of four c minus three,and what is that going to be equal to?That is going to be equal to, let's see,f of three we already figured out is three,f of one we already figured out is one,and so we get three minus one over three minus one,well that's gonna be two over two, which is equal to one.So there's some point between one and threewhere the derivative at that point,the slope of the tangent line, is equal to one.So let's see if we can solve this thing right over here.We can multiply both sides of this by four cby the square root of four c minus three,and so then we are going to gettwo is equal to the square root of four c minus three.All I did is multiply both sides of thisby square root of four c minus threeto get rid of this in the denominator,and so let's see, now we get rid of the radical,we can square both sides, and soactually let me just show that,so now we can square both sides,so we get four is equal to four c minus three,add three to both sides, seven is equal to four c,and then divide both sides by four.I'll go right here to do it,you're going to get c is equal to seven fourths.C is equal to seven over four,which is equal to one and three fourths,or we could view this as 1.75.So actually, the c value is a little bit closer,I hand drew this, it's closer to about right over thereon our diagram, actually that looks pretty close,that actually looks pretty good,I just hand drew this curve so it's definitely not exact.But anyway, hopefully that gives youa sense of what's going on here.We're just saying, hey, the mean value theoremgives us some c where the slope of the tangent lineis the same as the slope of the linethat connects one, f of one, and three, f of three.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/justification-with-the-mean-value-theorem-table	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The table gives selected valuesof the differentiable function f.All right, can we use the mean value theoremto say that there is a value c such that f prime of cis equal to five and c is between four and six?If so, write a justification.Well it meets, to meet the, to use the mean value theorem,you have to be differentiable over the open intervaland continuous over the closed interval,so it seems like we've met that.Because if you're differentiable over an interval,you're definitely continuous over that interval.It's saying that it's just a generally differentiablefunction f I guess over any interval.But the next part is to say,all right, if that condition is met,then the slope of the secant linebetween four comma f of four and six comma f of six,that some at least one point in between four and sixwill have a derivative that is equalto the slope of the secant line.And so let's figure out what the slopeof the secant line is between four comma f of fourand six comma f of six.And if it's equal to five,then we could use the mean value theorem.If it's not equal to five,then the mean value theorem would not apply.And so let's do that.f of six minus f of four,all of that over six minus four is equal toseven minus threeover two, which is equal to two.So two not equal to five.So mean value theorem doesn't apply.All right let's, I'll put an exclamation markthere for emphasis.All right let's do the next part.Can we use the mean value theorem to saythat the equation f prime of x is equal to negative onehas a solution?And now the interval's from zero to two.If so, write a justification.All right so let's see this.So if we were to take the slope of the secant line,so f of two minus f of zero,all that over two minus zero.This is equal to negative two minus zero,all of that over two,which is equal to negative two over two,which is equal to negative one.And so and we also know that we meetthe continuity and differentiability conditions,and so we could say and sincef is generally differentiable,generally differentiable,differentiable,it will bedifferentiable, differentiable,and, and continuousover the interval from zero to two,and I'll say the closed interval.You just have to be differentiable over the open interval,but it's even better I guess if you're differentiableover the closed interval because you have to be continuousover the closed interval.And so, and since f is generally differentiable,it will be differentiable and continuous over zero two.So the mean value theorem tells us,tells us, that thereis an xin that interval from zero to twosuch thatf prime of xis equal to that secant slope,or you could say that average rate of change,is equal to negative one.And so I could write,yes, yes, and then this would be my justification.This is the slope of the secant lineor the average rate of change,and since f is generally differentiable,it will be differentiable and continuousover the closed interval.So the mean value theorem tells usthat there is an x in this intervalsuch that f prime of x is equal to negative one.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/justification-with-the-mean-value-theorem-equation	khanacademy	video	:00- [Tutor] Let g of x equal one over x.Can we use the mean value theoremto say that the equation g prime of x is equal to one halfhas a solution where negative oneis less than x is less than two,if so, write a justification.Alright, pause this videoand see if you can figure that out.So the key to using the mean value theorem,even before you even think about using it,you have to make surethat you are continuous over the closed intervaland differentiable over the open interval,so this is the open interval hereand then the closed interval would include the end points.But you might immediately realizethat both of these intervals contain x equals zeroand if x equals zero, the function is undefinedand if it's undefined there,well it's not going to continuousor differentiable at that pointand so no,not continuousor differentiable,differentiableover the interval,over the interval.Alright, let's do the second part.Can we use the mean value theoremto say that there is a value c such that g prime of cis equal to negative one halfand one is less than c is less than twoif so, write a justification.So pause the video again.Alright, so in this situation, between one and twoon both the open and the closed intervals,well, this is a rational functionand a rational function is going to be continuousand differentiable at every point in its domainand its domain completely containsthis open and closed intervalor another way to think about it,every point on this open intervaland on the closed interval is in the domain,so we can write g of xis a rationalfunction,which lets us know that it is continuousand differentiable at every point in its domain,at every pointin its domain,the closed interval from one to twois in domainand so now, let's see what the average rate of change isfrom one to twoand so we get g of twominus g of oneover two minus one is equal to one halfminus one over one, which is equal to negative one half,therefore,thereforeby themean value theorem,there must be a cwhere one is less than c is less than twoand g prime of c is equal tothe average rate of change between the end points,negative one halfand we're done, so we can put a big yes right over thereand then this is our justification.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-mean-value-theorem/v/getting-a-ticket-because-of-the-mean-value-theorem	khanacademy	video	:00You may think that the mean value theorem is justthis arcane theorem that shows up in calculus classes.But what we will see in this videois that it has actually been used-- at least implicitlyused-- to give people speeding tickets.So let's think of an example.So let's say that this is a toll booth, right here.You're on the turnpike, and this is a toll booth at point A.And you get your toll-- you reach it at exactly 1:00 PM,and then the highway's computers and stuff register that.Let's say you have some type of-- one of those devicesso that when you pay the toll it just knows who you areand it registers-- it takes your money from an accountsomeplace.So it sees that you got there at exactly 1:00 PM.And then, let's say that you get offof the toll highway, the turnpike.Let's say you get off of it at point B,and you get there exactly 2:00 PM.I'm making these numbers very easy to work with.And let's say that they are 80 miles apart.So this distance right over here is 80 miles.And let's say that the speed limiton this stretch of highway is 55 miles per hour.So the question is, can the authoritiesprove that you went over the speed limit?Well, let's just graph this.I think you know where this is going.So let's graph it.So let's say this right over here is our position.So I'll call that the s-axis, s for position.And that's going to be in miles.And s is, obviously, s doesn't really stand for position.But p, you know, it kind of looks like rho for density.And d we use for differentials for distance or displacement.So s is what gets used for position very often.So let's say s is our position.And let's see, this is t for time.And let's say this is in hours.And let's see, we care about the intervalfrom time going from time 1 to time 2.I'm not really drawing the axes completely at scale.Would you let me just assume that there's a gap herejust because I don't actually wantto make you think that I'm drawing it completely at scale.Because I really want to focus on this part of the interval.So this is time equals to 2 hours.And so at time equal 1, you're right over here.And let's say this position is, we'll just call that s of 1.And at time 2, you're at this position right over here.You're right over there.And so your position is s of 2.You're at that coordinate right over there.And that's all we know.That's all we know.Well, we know a few other things.We know what our change in time is, it's 2 minus 1.And we know what our change in position is.We know that our change in position,which is equal to s of 2 minus s of 1, is equal to 80 miles.The change in position is 80 miles.So let me write that, and we'll just for simplicityassume it was a straight highway.So our change in distance is the same as our changein position, same as change in displacement.So this is 80 miles.And then what is our change in time?Over our change in time, well that's going to be 2 minus 1.Which is just going to be 1 hour.Or we could say that the slope of the line thatconnects these two points-- let medo that in another color-- that's the same color--the slope of this line right over here is 80 miles per hour.Slope is equal to 80 miles per hour.Or you could say that your average velocity over that hourwas 80 miles per hour.And what the authorities could do in a court of law,and I've never heard a mathematical theoremcited like this, but they could.And I remember reading about this about 10 years ago,and it was very controversial.The authorities said look, over this interval,your average velocity was clearly 80 miles per hour.So at some point in that hour-- and they could have cited,they could have said by the mean value theorem--at some point in that hour, you musthave been going at exactly 80 miles, at least,frankly, 80 miles per hour.And it would have been very hard to disprovebecause your position as a function of timeis definitely continuous and differentiableover that interval.It's continuous, you're not just gettingteleported from one place to another.That would be a pretty amazing car.And it is also differentiable.You always have a well defined velocity.And so I challenge anyone.Try to connect these two points witha continuous and differentiable curve, where at some pointthe instantaneous velocity, the slope of the tangent line,is not the same thing as the slope of this line.It's impossible.The mean value theorem tells us it's impossible.So let me just draw.So we could imagine.Say I had to stop to pay, to kind of registerwhere I am on the highway, then Istart to accelerate a little bit.So right now, my instantaneous velocityis less than my average velocity.I'm accelerating.The slope of the tangent line.But if I want to get there at that time,and especially because I have to slow down as I approach it,as I approach the tollbooth.The only way I could connect these two things-- well let'ssee, I'm going to have to-- at some point, at this point,I'm actually going faster than the 80 miles per hour.And the mean value theorem just tells us, that look,that this function is continuous and differentiableover this interval.Continuous over the closed interval.Differentiable over the open interval.That there's at least one point in the open interval, whichit calls c, so there's at least one point whereyour instantaneous rate of change, wherethe slope of the tangent line, isthe same as the slope as the secant line.So that point right over there, that pointlooks like that right over there.And so if this is time c, that looks like it's likeat around 1:15, this-- the mean value theorem saysthat at some point, there exists some time wheres prime of c is equal to this average velocity,is equal to 80 miles per hour.And it doesn't look like that's the only one.It looks like this one over here,this could also be a candidate for c.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-extreme-value-theorem-and-critical-points/v/minima-maxima-and-critical-points	khanacademy	video	:00I've drawn a crazy looking function here in yellow.And what I want to think about iswhen this function takes on the maximum valuesand minimum values.And for the sake of this video, wecan assume that the graph of this functionjust keeps getting lower and lower and loweras x becomes more and more negative, and lower and lowerand lower as x goes beyond the intervalthat I've depicted right over here.So what is the maximum value that this function takes on?Well we can eyeball that.It looks like it's at that point right over there.So we would call this a global maximum.the?Function never takes on a value larger than this.So we could say that we have a global maximum at the point x0.Because f of of x0 is greater than, or equal to,f of x, for any other x in the domain.And that's pretty obvious, when you look at it like this.Now do we have a global minimum point,the way that I've drawn it?Well, no.This function can take an arbitrarily negative values.It approaches negative infinity as xapproaches negative infinity.It approaches negative infinity as xapproaches positive infinity.So we have-- let me write this down--we have no global minimum.Now let me ask you a question.Do we have local minima or local maxima?When I say minima, it's just the plural of minimum.And maxima is just the plural of maximum.So do we have a local minima here, or local minimum here?Well, a local minimum, you could imagine meansthat that value of the function at that pointis lower than the points around it.So right over here, it looks like we have a local minimum.And I'm not giving a very rigorous definition here.But one way to think about it is,we can say that we have a local minimum point at x1,as if we have a region around x1, where f of x1is less than an f of x for any x in this region right over here.And it's pretty easy to eyeball, too.This is a low point for any of the values of f around it,right over there.Now do we have any other local minima?Well it doesn't look like we do.Now what about local maxima?Well this one right over here-- let me do it in purple,I don't want to get people confused, actuallylet me do it in this color-- this point right over herelooks like a local maximum.Not lox, that would have to deal with salmon.Local maximum, right over there.So we could say at the point x1, or sorry, at the point x2,we have a local maximum point at x2.Because f of x2 is larger than f of x for anyx around a neighborhood around x2.I'm not being very rigorous.But you can see it just by looking at it.So that's fair enough.We've identified all of the maxima and minima, often calledthe extrema, for this function.Now how can we identify those, if we knew somethingabout the derivative of the function?Well, let's look at the derivativeat each of these points.So at this first point, right over here,if I were to try to visualize the tangent line--let me do that in a better color than brown.If I were to try to visualize the tangent line,it would look something like that.So the slope here is 0.So we would say that f prime of x0 is equal to 0.The slope of the tangent line at this point is 0.What about over here?Well, once again, the tangent linewould look something like that.So once again, we would say f prime at x1 is equal to 0.What about over here?Well, here the tangent line is actually not well defined.We have a positive slope going into it,and then it immediately jumps to being a negative slope.So over here, f prime of x2 is not defined.Let me just write undefined.So we have an interesting-- and once again, I'm not rigorouslyproving it to you, I just want you to get the intuition here.We see that if we have some type of an extrema--and we're not talking about when xis at an endpoint of an interval,just to be clear what I'm talking about when I'm talkingabout x as an endpoint of an interval.We're saying, let's say that the functionis where you have an interval from there.So let's say a function starts right over there, and thenkeeps going.This would be a maximum point, but it would be an end point.We're not talking about endpoints right now.We're talking about when we have points in between,or when our interval is infinite.So we're not talking about points like that,or points like this.We're talking about the points in between.So if you have a point inside of an interval,it's going to be a minimum or maximum.And we see the intuition here.If you have-- so non-endpoint min or max at, let's say,x is equal to a.So if you know that you have a minimum or a maximum point,at some point x is equal to a, and xisn't the endpoint of some interval,this tells you something interesting.Or at least we have the intuition.We see that the derivative at x is equal to ais going to be equal to 0.Or the derivative at x is equal to a is going to be undefined.And we see that in each of these cases.Derivative is 0, derivative is 0, derivative is undefined.And we have a word for these points where the derivative iseither 0, or the derivative is undefined.We called them critical points.So for the sake of this function,the critical points are, we could include x sub 0,we could include x sub 1.At x sub 0 and x sub 1, the derivative is 0.And x sub 2, where the function is undefined.Now, so if we have a non-endpoint minimum or maximumpoint, then it's going to be a critical point.But can we say it the other way around?If we find a critical point, where the derivative is 0,or the derivative is undefined, is thatgoing to be a maximum or minimum point?And to think about that, let's imagine this point right overhere.So let's call this x sub 3.If we look at the tangent line right over here,if we look at the slope right over here,it looks like f prime of x sub 3 is equal to 0.So based on our definition of critical point,x sub 3 would also be a critical point.But it does not appear to be a minimum or a maximum point.So a minimum or maximum point that's not an endpoint,it's definitely going to be a critical point.But being a critical point by itselfdoes not mean you're at a minimum or maximum point.So just to be clear that all of these pointswere at a minimum or maximum point.This were at a critical point, all of theseare critical points.But this is not a minimum or maximum point.In the next video, we'll start to think abouthow you can differentiate, or how you can tell,whether you have a minimum or maximum at a critical point.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-extreme-value-theorem-and-critical-points/v/finding-critical-numbers	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that f of x is equal to x times e to the negativetwo x squared, and we want to find any critical numbers for f.I encourage you to pause this video and think about,can you find any critical numbers of f.I'm assuming you've given a go at it.Let's just remind ourselves what a critical number is.We would say c is a criticalnumber of f, if and only if.I'll write if with two f's, short for if and only if,f prime of c is equal to zero or f prime of c is undefined.If we look for the critical numbers for f we want to figureout all the places where the derivative of this withrespect to x is either equal to zero or it is undefined.Let's think about how we can find the derivative of this.f prime of x is going to be, well let's see.We're going to have to apply some combinationof the product rule and the chain rule.It's going to be the derivative with respect to x of x,so it's going to be that,times e to the negative two x squared plus the derivativewith respect to x of e to the negative two x squaredtimes x. This is just the product rule right over here.Derivative of the x times e to thenegative of two x squared plus the derivative of e to thenegative two x squared times x, right over here.What is this going to be?Well all of this stuff in magenta,the derivative of x with respect to x,that's just going to be equal to one.This first part is going to be equalto e to the negative two x squared.Now the derivative of e to thenegative two x squared over here.I'll do this in this pink color.This part right over here, that is going to be equal to-We'll just apply the chain rule.Derivative of e to the negative two x squared withrespect to negative two x squared, well that'sjust going to be e to the negative two x squared.We're going to multiply that times thederivative of negative two x squared with respect to x.That's going to be what, negative four x.Times negative four x, and ofcourse we have this x over here.We have that x over there and let's see,can we simplify it at all?Well obviously both of these terms havean e to the negative two x squared.I'm going to try to figure out where this iseither undefined or where this is equal to zero.Let's think about this a little bit.If we factor out e to the negative two x squared,I'll do that in green.We're going to have,this is equal to e to the negative two x squared times,we have here, one minus four x squared.One minus four x squared.This is the derivative of f.Where would this be undefined or equal to zero?e to the negative two x squared,this is going to be defined for any value of x,this part is going to be defined,and this part is also going to be defined for any value of x.There's no point where this is undefined.Let's think about when this is going to be equal to zero.The product of these two expressions equalling zero,e to the negative two x squared,that will never be equal to zero.If you get this exponent to be a really,I guess you could say very negative number,you will approach zero but you will never get it to be zero.This part here can't be zero.If the product of two things are zero at leastone of them has to be zero, so the only waywe can get f prime of x to be equal to zero iswhen one minus four x squared is equal to zero.One minus four x squared is equalto zero, let me rewrite that.One minus four x squared is equalto zero, when does that happen?This one we can just solve.Add four x squared to both sides,you get one is equal to four x squared.Divide both sides by four, you getone fourth is equal to x squared.Then what x values is this true at?We just take the plus or minus square root of both sidesand you get x is equal to plus or minus one half.Negative one half squared is one fourth,positive one half squared is one fourth.If x equals plus or minus one half f prime,or the derivative, is equal to zero.Let me write it this way.f prime of one half is equal to zero,and you can verify that right over here.And f prime of negative one half is equal to zero.If someone asks what are the critical numbers here,they are one half and negative one half.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-intervals-on-which-a-function-is-increasing-or-decreasing/v/increasing-decreasing-intervals-given-the-function	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's say we have the functionF of X is equal to X to the sixth,minus three X to the fifth.And my question to youis using only what we know about derivatives.Try to figure out over what interval or intervalsis this function decreasing?Pause the video and try to figure that out.All right, now let's do this together.So we know that a function is decreasingwhen its derivative is negative.Or another way to say it,It's going to be decreasingwhen F prime of Xis less than zero.So what is F prime of X?Well, we could use the derivative rulesand drew the properties we know.We apply the power rule to X, to the sixth,We bring the six out frontor multiply the one coefficient here,times six, to get six,X to the fifthdetriment that exponent,minus bring the five times the threeminus 15, X to the,we detriment the five,so X to the fourth.And we need to figure outover what intervals is this going to be less than zero.And now let's see how we can simplify this a little bit.Both of these terms are divisible by X to the fourth,and they're both divisible by three.So let's factor out a three X to the fourthtimes, you factor out of three X to the fourth year,you're left with a two X,and then over here you have minus fivehas to be less than zero.Any interval where this is true,we are going to be decreasing.Now, how do we get this to be less than zero?Well, if I take the product of two thingsand it's less than zero,that means that they have to have different signs,either one's positive and the other's negativeor one's negative and the other's positive.So we have two situations.So we could say either,either, three X to the fourthis greater than zeroand, and two X minus fiveis less than zero.So that's one situation.I'll do some in a different color,or I'll do this one in a different color,three X to the fourth is less than zeroand two X minus fiveis greater than zero.Actually let me stay on the second case first.Are there any situationswhere three X to the fourth can be less than zero?You take any number,you take it to the fourth powereven if it's a negative,it's going to become a positive.So you can't get a negative expression right over here.So actually the second condition is impossible to obtain.You can't get any situation for any Xwhere three X to the fourth is less than zero.So we can rule this one out.And so this is our best hope.So under what conditions is three X to the fourth,greater than zero.Well, if you divide both sides by three,you get X to the fourth is greater than zero.And if you think about it,this is gonna be true for any X valuethat is not equal to zero.Even if you have a negative value there,if you have a negative one,you take it to the fourth power becomes a positive one.Only zero will be equal to zerowhen you take it to the fourth power.So one way we could say thisis going to be true for any non zero X,or we could just say, X does not equal zero,and, this is a little bit more straightforward,we add five to both sideswe get two X is less than five,divide both sides by two,you get X is less than five halves.So it might be tempting to say, all right,the intervals that matter areall the exes less than five halves,but X cannot be equal to zero.Now, is that the entire intervalwhere our function is decreasing?Well, let's think about what happens at zero itself.We're decreasing over the interval from negative infinityall the way up to zero.And we're also decreasing from zero to five halves.And so for decreasing right to the left of zero,we're decreasing right to the right of zero,we're actually going to be decreasing at zeroat we're also gonna be decreasing at zero as well.So there's something interesting here,even though the derivative at X equals zero,is going to be equal to zero,we are still decreasing.And so the interval that we care aboutthe interval over which we're decreasingis just X is less than five halves.And we can see that by graphing the function,I graphed it on Desmos,and you can see herethat the function is decreasing from negative infinity,it's decreasing at a slower and slower ratewe get to zero still decreasing to the left of zero,and then it continues to decrease to the right of zero.So any, any value, any X value to the left of zerothe value of the function is going to belarger than F of zero,and X to the right of zero.The value of the function is going to beless than the function at zero.So it's actually decreasing through zero,even though the slope of the tangent line at zero is zero,even though it's non negativeand then we keep decreasingso we're decreasing for all values of X,less than five halves,which you can see visually here.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-intervals-on-which-a-function-is-increasing-or-decreasing/v/finding-increasing-interval-given-derivative	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let g be a function definedfor all real numbers.Also let g prime, the derivative of g,be defined as g prime of xis equal to x squared over x minus two to the third power.On which intervals is g increasing?Well, at first you might say, they don't even give us g.How do we figure out when g is increasing?Well, the answer is all we need is g primewhich they do give us.And saying on which intervals is g increasing,that's equivalent to saying,on which intervals is the first derivative with respect to xon which intervals is that going to be greater than zero?If your rate of change with respect to xis greater than zero, if it's positive,then your function itself is going to be increasing.And so there's a couple of ways that we could approach this.You might just want to inspectkind of the structure of this expression and think about,well, when is that going to be greater than zeroor we could do it a little bit more methodically.We could say, well, let's look at the critical pointsor the critical values for g.So critical,critical pointsfor gand just to remind ourselves what critical points are,that is when g prime of x is equal to zeroor g prime of x is undefined,is undefined,and we have videos on critical points or critical valuesand why those are relevant is those are the places,those are possible places where the sign could change,the sign of g prime could change.So when is g prime of x equal to zero?Well, the way to get g prime of x equal to zerois getting the numerator equal to zeroand that's only going to happenif x squared is equal to zero or if x is equal to zero.So that's the only place where g prime of xis equal to zeroand where is g prime of x undefined?Well, it's going to be undefinedif the denominator becomes undefined.The denominator becomes undefined if the denominator is zeroand so that's going to happenif x minus two is equal to zero,x minus two is equal to zero or x is equal to two.So we have two critical points or critical values hereand what I'm going to do is I want to graph them.Let's put them on a number lineand let's just think about what g prime is doingin the intervals between the critical points.So let's start at zero,one, two,three and then let's go to negative oneand we have a critical point at,let me do that in magenta,we have a critical point at x equals zero right over thereand we have a critical point at x equals,at x equals two right over there.And so let's think about what g prime is doingin the intervals between the critical valuesor on either side of the critical values.So let's think about,let's first think about this interval.Let me do it in this purple color.Let's think about the interval between,between negative infinity and zero.So if we think about this interval,so negative infinity and zero,that open interval,well, if we look at g prime,the numerator is still going to be positive.If you take any negative value squared,you're going to get a positive valueso this is going to be positive.Now, what about the denominator?You take a negative number, you subtract two from it,you're still going to get a negative numberand then you take it to the third power.Well, a negative number to the third poweris going to be a negative numberso that right over there is going to be negative.So you're going to have a positive divided by a negativeso g prime is going to be negativeso let me write that down.So on this interval, on this interval,I'll write it like this.g prime of x is less than zeroor if we cared or if we want to know when it's decreasing,we would know it's definitely decreasing over that interval.Now, let's take the interval between zero and tworight over here.So this is the intervalfrom zero to two, the open interval.So what's going to go on with g prime of x here?Well, once again, x squared,anything greater than a zeroand it says we're not including zero in this interval.Well, this is for sure going to be positiveand so let's see, if we have x minus twowhere x is greater than zero but less than two.So if x, we could just say for example, if x was one,one minus two is negative one.We're still going to get negative valuesin this denominator right over here.So since we're still going to get negative valuesin this denominator,the denominator is still going to be,you take a negative value to the third power,well, you're going to still get a negative valueso this is going to be negative.So you're still going to have g prime as less than zeroso let me write that down.So you still have g prime of xis less than zero.And then let's take the interval above.Let's take the interval from two to infinity.Two to infinity.Well, the numerator is positive.It's always going to be positivefor any x not being equal to zeroand this denominator,you're taking values greater than two,subtracting two from itwhich is still going to give you a positive value.You take the third power, it's all going to be positive.It is all going to be positive.So this is the interval where g prime of xis greater than zero.So on which intervals is g increasing?Well, that's where g prime of x is greater than zeroso it's going to be from two,from two to infinity or we could just write it like this.We could write x is greater than two.Either way,for either of these, g prime of x is greater than zeroand your function g is going to be increasing.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-relative-local-extrema/v/relative-minima-maxima	khanacademy	video	:00So right over here I've graphed the functiony is equal to f of x.I've graphed over this interval.It looks like it's between 0 and some positive value.And I want to think about the maximum and minimum pointson this.So we've already talked a little bit about absolute maximumand absolute minimum points on an interval.And those are pretty obvious.We hit a maximum point right over here,right at the beginning of our interval.It looks like when x is equal to 0,this is the absolute maximum point for the interval.And the absolute minimum point for the intervalhappens at the other endpoint.So if this a, this is b, the absolute minimum pointis f of b.And the absolute maximum point is f of a.And it looks like a is equal to 0.But you're probably thinking, hey,there are other interesting points right over here.This point right over here, it isn't the largest.We're not taking on-- this value right over hereis definitely not the largest value.It is definitely not the largest valuethat the function takes on in that interval.But relative to the other values around it,it seems like a little bit of a hill.It's larger than the other ones.Locally, it looks like a little bit of a maximum.And so that's why this value right over herewould be called-- let's say this right over here c.This is c, so this is f of c-- we would callf of c is a relative maximum value.And we're saying relative because obviously the functiontakes on the other values that are larger than it.But for the x values near c, f of cis larger than all of those.Similarly-- I can never say that word.Similarly, if this point right over here is d, f of dlooks like a relative minimum pointor a relative minimum value.f of d is a relative minimum or a local minimum value.Once again, over the whole interval,there's definitely points that are lower.And we hit an absolute minimum for the intervalat x is equal to b.But this is a relative minimum or a local minimumbecause it's lower than the-- if welook at the x values around d, the function at those valuesis higher than when we get to d.So let's think about, it's fine for me to say,well, you're at a relative maximumif you hit a larger value of your functionthan any of the surrounding values.And you're at a minimum if you'reat a smaller value than any of the surrounding areas.But how could we write that mathematically?So here I'll just give you the definitionthat really is just a more formal wayof saying what we just said.So we say that f of c is a relative max,relative maximum value, if f of cis greater than or equal to f of x for allx that-- we could say in a casual way, for all x near c.So we could write it like that.But that's not too rigorous because whatdoes it mean to be near c?And so a more rigorous way of saying it,for all x that's within an open interval of c minush to c plus h, where h is some value greater than 0.So does that make sense?Well, let's look at it.So let's construct an open interval.So it looks like for all of the x values in--and you just have to find one open interval.There might be many open intervals where this is true.But if we construct an open interval thatlooks something like that, so this value right over hereis c plus h.That value right over here c minus h.And you see that over that interval,the function at c, f of c is definitelygreater than or equal to the value of the functionover any other part of that open interval.And so you could imagine-- I encourageyou to pause the video, and you could write outwhat the more formal definition of a relative minimum pointwould be.Well, we would just write-- let's taked as our relative minimum.We can say that f of d is a relative minimum pointif f of d is less than or equal to fof x for all x in an interval, in an open interval,between d minus h and d plus h for h is greater than 0.So you can find an interval here.So let's say this is d plus h.This is d minus h.The function over that interval, f of d is alwaysless than or equal to any of the other values,the f's of all of these other x's in that interval.And that's why we say that it's a relative minimum point.So in everyday language, relative max--if the function takes on a larger value at cthan for the x values around c.And you're at a relative minimum valueif the function takes on a lower valueat d than for the x values near d.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-relative-local-extrema/v/testing-critical-points-for-local-extrema	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video we saw that if a function takeson a minimum or maximum value, min max value for our functionat x equals a, then a is a critical point.But then we saw that the other way aroundisn't necessarily true. x equal a being a critical point doesnot necessarily mean that the function takeson a minimum or maximum value at that point.So what we're going to try to do this videois try to come up with some criteria,especially involving the derivative of the functionaround x equals a, to figure out if itis a minimum or a maximum point.So let's look at what we saw in the last video.We saw that this point right over hereis where the function takes on a maximum value.So this critical point in particular was x naught.What made it a critical point was that the derivative is 0.You have a critical point where either the derivative is 0or the derivative is undefined.So this is a critical point.And let's explore what the derivative isdoing as we approach that point.So in order for this to be a maximum point,the function is increasing as we approach it.The function is increasing is another wayof saying that the slope is positive.The slope is changing but it stays positivethe whole time which means that the function is increasing.And the slope being positive is another wayof saying that the derivative is greater than 0as we approach that point.Now what happens as we pass that point?Right at that point the slope is 0.But then as we past that point, whathas to happen in order for that to be a maximum point?Well the value of the function has to go down.If the value of the function is going down,that means the slope is negative.And that's so another way of sayingthat the derivative is negative.So that seems like a pretty good criteriafor identifying whether a critical point isa maximum point.So let's say that we have critical point a.We are at a maximum point if f primeof x switches signs from positive to negative as wecross x equals a.That's exactly what happened right over here.Let's make sure it happened at our other maximum point rightover here.So right over here, as we approach that pointthe function is increasing.The function increasing means that the slope is positive.It's a different positive slope.The slope is changing, it's actuallygetting more, and more, and more steep.Or more, and more, and more positive.But is definitely positive.So it's positive going into that point.And then it becomes negative after we cross that point.The slope was undefined right at the point.But it did switch signs from positive to negativeas we crossed that critical point.So these both meet our criteria for being a maximum point.So, so far our criteria seems pretty good.Now let's make sure that somehow this point right over here,which we identified in the last video as a critical point,let's make-- and I think we called this x0, this was x1,this was x2.So this is x3.Let's make sure that this doesn't somehowmeet the criteria because we see visuallythat this is not a maximum point.So as we approach this, our slope is negative.And then as we cross it, our slope is still negative,we're still decreasing.So we haven't switched signs.So this does not meet our criteria, which is good.Now let's come up with the criteria for a minimum point.And I think you could see where this is likely to go.Well we identified in the last video that this right over hereis a minimum point.We can see that.It's a local minimum just by looking at it.And what's the slope of doing as we approach it?So the function is decreasing, the slopeis negative as we approach it.f prime of x is less than 0 as we approach that point.And then right after we cross it--this wouldn't be a minimum point if the functionwere to keep decreasing somehow.The function needs to increase now.So let me do that same green.So right after that, the functionstarts increasing again.f prime of x is greater than 0.So this seems like pretty good criteria for a minimum point.f prime of x switches signs from negative to positive as wecross a.If we have some critical point a,the function takes on a minimum valueat a if the derivative of our function switches signsfrom negative to positive as we crossa, from negative to positive.Now once again, this point right over here,this critical point x sub 3 does not meet that criteria.We go from negative to 0 right at thatpoint then go to negative again.So this is not a minimum or a maximum point.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-relative-local-extrema/v/finding-relative-maximum-example	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] So we have g(x) being equalto x to the fourth minus x to the fifth,and what we wanna do without having to graph g,we want to figure out at what x valuesdoes g have a relative maximum?And just to remind us what's going on in a relative maximum,so let me draw a hypothetical function right over here,so a relative maximum is going to happen,so you can visually inspect this,okay that looks like a relative maximum.That's kind of a top of a mountain or top of a hill,these all look like relative maximum and what's in common?Well the graph, the function is going fromincreasing to decreasing at each of those points.It's going from increasing to decreasing.Increasing to decreasing at either of the points,or you could say that the first derivativeis going from positive to negative.So if you look at this interval right over here,g prime is greater than zero,and then over the next interval when you're decreasing,g prime would be less than zero.So what we really need to think aboutis when does g prime, so let me see,relative, we care about relative maximum point,and so that's essentially askingwhen does g primego from positive to negative?From,from,I wrote fror.From g prime greater than zero,to g prime less than zero,and the values that we could look at or the pointsare our critical points and critical pointsare where g prime is either zero or it is undefined.So let's think about it,where is g prime of x equal to zero?g prime of x is equal to zerowhen well let's just take g prime of x.We're gonna leverage the power rule right here,four x to the third power, four x to the third,minus five x to the fourth.Minus five x to the fourth is equal to zero.Let's see, we can factor out an x to the third.So we have x to the third times fourminus five x is equal to zero.So this is going to happen when x is equal to zero.Let me not skip steps.So this is going to happen whenx to the third is equal to zero,or four minus five x is equal to zero.For x to the third equaling zero,that's only gonna happen when x is equal to zero,and four minus five x equaling zero,we'll add five x to both sides,you get four is equal to five x,divide both sides by five, you get 4/5 is equal to x.So here these are the two places,where our derivative is equal to zero.Now are there any places where our derivative is undefined?Well our function right over hereis just a straight up polynomial.Our derivative is another polynomial,it is defined for all real numbers.So these are our two critical points,or we could even say critical values.Now let's think of what g prime is doing on either sideof these critical values,and I'll draw a little number line hereto help us visualize this, and so.So there we go, little bit of a number line.Let's see we care about zero and we care about 4/5.So let's say this is negative 1,this is zero, this is one,and so we have one critical point at,let me do this in magenta,we have one critical point here at x equals zero,and then we have another critical point.I will do this at x equals 4/5.So 4/5 is right around there.So that is 4/5 and let's just think aboutwhat g prime is doing in these intervals,and these critical points are the only placeswhere g prime might switch sides, switch signs.So let's first think about this,let me pick some colors I haven't used yet.So let's think about the intervalfrom negative infinity to zero.So this is the open interval from negative infinity to zero,and we could just plug in a value,let's try negative one, negative one is prettystraight forward to evaluate.So let's see you have four, you're gonna have fourtimes negative one to the third power.So that's gonna be four times negative one,minus five times negative one to the fourth power.So that's just gonna be one.So let's see this is going to be negative four minus five.Which is negative nine, so right over here,g prime is equal to negative nine,and so we know over this whole interval,since it's to the left of this critical point,we know that g prime of x is less than zero,and so our function itself is decreasingover this interval and so we know we need to gofrom increasing to decreasing,so you can already say well we can't go from increasingto decreasing at this critical point,because we're already decreasing to the left of it,but anyway let's just think aboutwhat's happening at the other intervals.So in the interval between zero and 4/5,so that interval right over there,so it's between zero and 4/5,well let's just sample a number there.Let's say the number, I don't know, 1/2?Might be fairly straightforward.So we can evaluate g prime of 1/2, g prime of 1/2,is equal to four times 1/2 to the third power.1/2 to the third power is 1/8.So it's 4/8, or it's just 1/2 minus fivetimes 1/2 to the fourth so that's 5/16 minus 5/16 andso this is equal to 8/16minus 5/16 which is equal to 3/16,but the important thing is it's equal to a positive value.So in this blue interval right over there,and actually let me put 4/5 in a different colorso we see that it's not part of that interval.So in this light blue interval right herebetween zero and 4/5, g prime,g prime of x is greater than zero.So we know our function is increasing,and so let's see what's happening to the right of this,and the easiest value to try out would just be one.So let's try out x equals one.It's in that interval.So when x equals one, I'll just writeg prime of one is equal to four minus five.Four minus five, which is equal to negative one.So g prime of x is less than zero,g prime of x is less than zero.So our function, so we could say g is increasing here.It is decreasing, oh sorry let me be careful,g is decreasing here.The function itself is decreasingcause our derivative is negative.Then our function is increasing herecause our derivative is positive,and then our function is decreasing here.So at what critical point are we going fromincreasing to decreasing?Well we're doing that at x equals 4/5.So we have a relative maximum at x equals 4/5.4/5, if they said, ""Well where do we have""a relative minimum point?""Well that's going to be happen at x equals zero.We're going from decreasing to increasing,but we've answered their questionof where do we find a relative maximum point."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-relative-local-extrema/v/analyzing-mistakes-when-finding-extrema-2	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] Erin was asked to find if f of xis equal to x squared minus one to the 2/3 powerhas a relative maximum.This is her solution.And then they give us her steps, and at the end they say,is Erin's work correct?If not, what's her mistake?So pause this video and see if you canfigure it out yourself.Is Erin correct, or did you she make a mistake,and where was that mistake?All right, now let's just do it together.So she says that this is the derivative.I'm just going to reevaluate here to the right of her work.So let's see, f prime of x is just going to bethe chain rule.I'm gonna take the derivative of the outsidewith respect to the inside.So this is going to be 2/3 times x squared minus oneto the 2/3 minus one, so to the negative 1/3 power,times the derivative of the inside with respect to x.So the derivative of x squared minus one with respect to xis two x.(siren ringing)There's a fire hydrant, a fire (laughing),not a hydrant, that would be a noisy hydrant.There's a fire truck outside, but okay,I think it's passed.But this looks like what she got for the derivative.Because if you multiply two times two x,you do indeed get four x.You have this three right over here in the denominator.And x squared minus one to the negative 1/3,that's the same thing as x squared minus oneto the 1/3 in the denominator,which is the same thing as the cubed rootof x squared minus one.So all of this is looking good.That is indeed the derivative.Step two, the critical point is x equals zero.So let's see, a critical point is where our first derivativeis either equal to zero or it is undefined.And so it does indeed seem that f prime of zerois going to be four times zero,it's gonna be zero over three times the cubed rootof zero minus one, of negative one.And so this is three times negative one,or zero over negative three,so this is indeed equal to zero.So this is true.A critical point is at x equals zero.But a question is, is this the only critical point?Well as we've mentioned, a critical pointis where a function's derivative is either equal to zeroor it's undefined.This is the only one where the derivative's equal to zero,but can you find some x-valueswhere the derivative is undefined?Well what if we make the derivative,what would make the denominator of the derivativeequal to zero?Well if x squared minus one is equal to zero,you take the cube root of zero,you're gonna get zero in the denominator.So what would make x squared minus one equal to zero?Well x is equal to plus or minus one.These are also critical points because they makef prime of x undefined.So I'm not feeling good about step two.It is true that a critical point is x equals zero,but it is not the only critical point.So I would put that there.And the reason why it's important,you might say, ""Well what's the harm in not noticing""these other critical points?""She identified one,""maybe this is the relative maximum point.""But as we talked about in other videos,in order to use the first derivative test, so to speak,and find this place where the first derivative is zero,in order to test whether it is a maximum or minimum point,is you have to sample values on either side of itto make sure that you have a change,a change in sign of the derivative.But you have to make sure that when you teston either side that you're not going beyondanother critical point.Because critical points are placeswhere you can change direction.And so let's see what she does in step threeright over here.Well it is indeed in step three that's she's testing,she's trying to test values on either sideof the critical point that she,that the one critical point that she identified.But the problem here, the reason why this is a little shady,is this is beyond another critical pointthat is less than zero,and this is beyond, this is greaterthan another critical point that is greater than zero.This is larger than the critical point one,and this is less than the critical point negative one.What she should've tried is x equals 0.5and x equals negative 0.5.So this is what she shoulda doneis try maybe negative two, negative one,negative 1/2, zero,1/2, and then one we know is undefined,and then positive two.Because this is a candidate extremum,this is a candidate extremum,and this is a candidate extremum right over here.And so you wanna see in which of these situationsyou have a sign change of the derivative.And you just wanna test in the intervalsbetween the extremum points.So I would say that really the main mistake she madeis in step two is not identifyingall of the critical points."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-concavity-and-inflection-points-intro/v/inflection-points	khanacademy	video	:00If you were paying close attention in the last video,an interesting question might have popped up in your brain.We have talked about the intervals over whichthe function is concave downwards.And then we talked about the intervalover which the function is concave upwards.But we see here that there's a point at which we transitionfrom being concave downwards to concave upwards.Before that point, the slope was decreasing,and then the slope starts increasing.The slope was decreasing and thenthe slope started increasing.So that's one way to look at it.Right here in our function we go from beingconcave downwards to concave upwards.When you look at our derivative at that point,our derivative went from decreasing to increasing.And when you look at our second derivative at that point,it went from being negative to positive.So this must have some type of a special name you're probablythinking.And you'd be thinking correctly.This point at which we transition from being concavedownwards to concave upwards, or the point at whichour derivative has a extrema point,or the point at which our second derivative switches signslike this, we call it an inflection point.And the most typical way that peoplethink about how could you test for an inflection point,it's a point, well, conceptually, it'swhere you go from being a downward openingu to an upward opening u.Or when you go from being concavedownwards to concave upwards.But the easiest test is it's a pointat which your second derivative switches signs.So in this case, we went from negative to positive.But we could have also switched from beingpositive to negative.So inflection point, your second derivative f prime prime of xswitches signs.Goes from being positive to negativeor negative to positive.Switches signs.So this is a case where we went from concave downwardsto concave upwards.If we went from concave upwards to concave downwards,like that, then this inflection point up until that point,the slope was increasing.So the second derivative would to be positive.And then the slope is decreasing,so your second derivative would be negative.So here your second derivative isgoing from positive to negative.Here your second derivative is goingfrom negative to positive.In either case, you are talking about an inflection point.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-concavity-and-inflection-points-intro/v/inflection-points-graphically-given-function	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We're told let g bea differentiable function definedover the closed interval from negative four to four.The graph of g is given right over here, given below.How many inflection points does the graph of g have?So let's just remind ourselves, what are inflection points?So inflection points are where we change concavity.So we go from concave,concave upwards, upwards, actually let me justdraw it graphically.We're going from concave upwards to concave downwards,or concave downwards to concave upwards.Or another way you could think about it,you could say we're going from our slope increasing,increasing, increasing,to our slope decreasing.To our slope decreasing,or the other way around.Any points where your slope goes from decreasing,our slope goes from decreasing, to increasing.To increasing.So let's think about that.So as we start off right over here,at the extreme left it's seems likewe have a very high slope.It's a very steep curve,and then it stays increasing but it's getting less positive.So it's getting a little bit,it's getting a little bit flatter,so our slope is at a very high level but it's decreasing.It's decreasing, decreasing, decreasing,slope is decreasing, decreasing even more.It's even more and then it's actually going to zero,our slope is zero and then it becomes negative.So our slope is still decreasing.Then it's becoming more and more and more negative,and then right around, and then right around here,it looks like it starts becoming less negative,or starts increasing.So our slope is increasing increasing,it's really just becoming less and less negative,and then it's going close to zero,approaching zero, it looks like our slopeis zero right over here,but then it looks like right over thereour slope begins decreasing again.So it looks like our slope is decreasing again.So it looks like our slope is decreasing.It's becoming more and more and more and more negative,and so it looks like something interesting happenedright over there, we got a transition point,and then right around here, it looks like it starts,the slope starts increasing again.So it looks like the slope starts increasing.It's negative but it's becoming lessand less and less negative and then it becomes zeroand then it becomes positive and thenmore and more and more and more positive.So inflection points are where we gofrom slope increasing to slope decreasing.So concave upwards to concave downwards,and so slope increasing was here to slope decreasing,so this was an inflection point,and also from slope decreasing to slope increasing.So that's slope decreasing to slope increasing,and this is also slope decreasing to slope increasing.So how many inflection points does the graph of g havethat we can see on this graph?Well it has three over the intervalthat at least we can see.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-analyzing-concavity-and-inflection-points/v/analyzing-concavity-algebraically	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So I have the function g here.It's expressed as a fourth degree polynomial.And I wanna think about the intervals over which g iseither concave upwards or concave downwards.Now let's just remind ourselves what these things look like.So concave,concave upwardsis an interval,an interval when you're concave upwardsis an interval over which the slope is increasingand it tends to look like an upward opening U like that.And you can see here that the slope over here is negative,and then as x increases, it becomes less negative,it actually approaches zero, it becomes zero,then it crosses zero and becomes slightly positive,more positive, even more positive.So you can see the slope is constantly increasing.And if you think about it in terms of derivatives,it means that you're first derivative is increasingover that interval.And in order for your first derivative to be increasingover that interval, your second derivativef prime prime of x, actually let me write it as g,because we're using g in this example.In order for your first derivative to be increasing,your, let me write this.So g,so concave upward meansthat your first derivative increasing,increasing,which means, which means that your second derivativeis greater than zero.And concave downward is the opposite.Concave downward,downward,is an interval, or you're gonna be concave downwardover an interval when your slope is decreasing.So g prime of x is decreasingor we can say that our second derivative,our second derivative is less than zero.And once again, I can draw it on this.So, when x is lower, we have a, look,or it looks like we have a positive slope,then it becomes less positive,and then it becomes less positive,as it's approaching zero, it becomes zero,then it becomes negative, then even more negative,and then even more negative.So as you can see, our slope is constantly decreasingas x increases here.So in order to think about the intervalswhere g is either concave upward or concave downward,what we need to do is let's find the second derivative of g,and then let's think about the pointsat which the second, where the second derivative can gofrom being positive to negative or negative to positiveand those will be places where it's either undefinedor where the second derivative is equal to zero,and let's see what's happening in the interval between.And then we'll know over what intervalsare we concave upward or concave downward.So let's do that.So let's take the first derivative, g prime of x,just gonna apply the power rule a lot.Four times negative oneis negative four x to the third power plus, okay,so you're gonna have two times sixis plus 12x to the first power, you can just write it as x.And then minus two, I could sayminus two x to the zeroth power,but that's just minus two.And then the derivative of negative three, of a constantis just zero.And now I can take the second derivative, g prime prime of xis going to be equal to three times negative fouris negative 12x squared,decrement the exponent plus 12.And so let's see, where could this be undefined?Well, the second derivative is just a quadratic expressionhere which would be defined for any x.So it's not going to be undefined anywhere.So, interesting points where we could transitionfrom going from a negative to a positiveor a positive to a negative, second derivativeis where this thing could be equal to zero.So let's figure that out.So let's figure out where negative 12x plus 12could be equal to zero.See, we could subtract 12 from both sidesand we get negative 12x squared is equal to negative 12.Divide both sides by negative 12,you get x squared is equal to oneor x could be equal to the plus or minus,or x could be equal to the plus or minus square root of one,which is, of course, just one.So, at the second derivative at plus or minus oneis equal to zero, so either between plus or minus oneor on either side of them, we are going to be,we could be concave upward or concave downward.So let's think about this.And to think about this, I'm gonna make a number line.Let me find a nice, soothing color here.All right, that's a nice, soothing color.And, let's say, we should make the number linea little bit bigger.So, there we go, let's utilize the screen space.And so, if this is zero and this is negative one,this is negative two, this is positive one,this is positive two.We know that at x equals negative oneand x equals one, our second derivative is equal to zero.So let's think about what's happeningin between those places to see if our second derivativeis positive or negative, and from that we'll be able to saywhere it's concave upward or concave downward.So, on this first interval right over here,so this is the interval from,this is the interval where we're goingfrom negative infinity to negative one.Well, let's just try a value in that intervalto see what whether our second derivativeis positive or negative.And let's see, an easy value there could be negative two,it's in that interval,so let's take g prime prime of negative two,which is equal to negative 12 times four,because negative two squared is positive four.So it's negative 48 plus 12,so it's equal to negative 36.The important thing to realize, then,is well, if over here it's negative,then over this whole interval,because it's not crossing through zero,or it's not discontinuous at any of these points,that's why we picked this interval.That over this whole interval,g prime prime of x is less than zero,which means that over this intervalwe are concave downwards.So concave, concave downward,concave downward.Now let's go to the interval between negative one and one.So this is the open interval between negative one and one.And let's try a value there.Let's just try zero will be easy to compute,g prime prime of zero, well, when x is zero, this is zero,so it's just gonna be equal to 12.The important thing to realize is our second derivative hereis greater than zero, so we are concave upward,concave upward on this intervalbetween negative one and one.And then finally, let's look at, let's look atthe interval where x is greater than one.So this is the interval from one to infinity,if we want to do it that way.And let's just try a value.Let's try g prime prime of two,'cause that's in the interval.And g prime prime of two is gonna be the same thingas g prime prime of negative two,'cause whether you have a negative two or a positive two,you square it becomes four.So you're gonna have four times negative 12,which is negative 48 plus 12, which is negative 36.So this is negative 36, and so, once again on this intervalyou are concave, concave downward.Now let's, I graphed this ahead of time,let's see if what we just established is actually consistentwith what the graph actually looks like.We were able to come up with these, these insightsabout the concavity without graphing it.But now, it's kind of satisfying to take a look at a graphand actually let me see if I can match up the intervals.Actually this is pretty closely matched,all right over here.And so, this is,actually we can make it a little bit smaller, all right.And so, let me move my boundy box.So, I'm saying that I'm concave downwardbetween negative infinity, negative infinityall the way until, all the way until negative one,all the way until this point right over here.So, all the way until that point.And that looks right.It looks like the slope is constantly decreasingall the way until we get to x equals negative one,and then the slope starts increasing.The slope starts increasing from there,from there all the way,and right at x we're transitioning,so I'm gonna leave a little, I won't color in that.And so here our slope is increasing,let me do that same color.Our slope is increasing, increasing, increasing,increasing, increasing all the wayuntil we get to x equals one.And then our slope starts decreasing again.And we get back into concave downwards.Oops, I wanna do that in that orange color.We get back into concave downwards.So what we're able to figure outby just taking the derivatives and doing a little algebra,we can see quite clearly looking at the graph.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-analyzing-concavity-and-inflection-points/v/inflection-points-algebraically	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let G of X equal one fourth X to the fourth,minus four X to the third power, plus 24 X squared.For what values of X does the graph of Ghave an inflection point?Or have a point of inflection?So let's just remind ourselveswhat a point of inflection is.A point of inflection is where we go from being con,where we change our concavity.Or you can say where our second derivativeG prime of X switches signs.Switches, switches signs.So let's study our second derivative.In order to study or secondary, let's find it.So we know that G of X is equal to one fourthX to the fourth, minus four X to the third power,plus 24 X squared.So given that, let's now find G prime of X.G prime of X is going to be equal to,I'm just going to apply the power rule multiple times.Four times one fourth is just one.I'm not going to write that one down,it's going to be one times X to the four minus one power.So four to the third power,minus three times four is 12,X to three minus one power,X to the second power, plus two times 24, 48.X to the two minus one, or X to the first power,I can just write that as X.So there you have it.I have our first derivative,now we want to find our second derivative.G prime prime of X is just the derivativeof the first derivative of the first derivativewith respect to X, and some more of the power rule,three X squared minus 24 Xto the first, or just 24 X, plus 48.So let's think about where this switch is signed.And this is, this is a continuous function,is going to be defined for all Xs,so the only potential candidatesof where it could switch signsare when this thing equals zero.So let's see where it equals zero.So let's set that equal to zero.Three X squared minus 24 X plus 48is equal to zero, let's see,everything is divisible by threeso let's divide everything by three.So you get X squared minus eight X,plus 16, plus 16 is equal to zero.And let's see, can I factor this?Yeah, this would be X minus four X times X minus 4.Or just you do this as X minus four squaredis equal to zero, or X minus four is equal to zero.So, or where X equals four.So G prime prime of four is equal to zero.So let's see what's happening on either side of that.Let's see if G, if we're actually,if we're actually switching signs or not.So let me draw a number line here.And so this is, so this is two, three,four, five, and I could keep going.And so we know that something interestingis happening right over here,G prime prime of four is equal to zero,G prime prime of four is equal to zero.So let's think about what the second derivative iswhen we are less than four.And so, actually let me just try G prime prime of zero,since that will be easy to evaluate.G prime prime of zero,well it's just going to be equal to 48.So when we are less than four,our second derivative, G prime, the second derivative,is greater than zero.So we're actually going to be concave upwardsover this interval to the left of four.Now let's think about to the right of four.Two, use a different color.So what about to the right of four?And so let me just evaluate,what would be the easy thing to evaluate?Well I could evaluate G prime,why not do, or of the second derivative,G prime prime, I should say, of 10?So, G, I'll do it right over here,Let me do it, well,I'm running a little bit of space, so I'll just scroll down.So G prime prime of 10 is going to be equal to three times10 squared, so it's 300 minus 24 times 10.So minus 240, plus 48.So let's see, this is 60.This is, so 300 minus 240 is 60 plus 48,so this is equal to 108.So it still positive.So on either side of four, G prime prime of Xis greater than zero.So even though even though the second derivativeat X equals four is equal to zero,on either side we are concave upwards.On either side, the second derivative is positive.And so, and that was the only potential candidate.So there are no, there are no values of Xfor which G has a point of inflection.X equals four would have been a value of Xat which G had a point of inflection,if we switch, if the secondary derivativeswitched signs here, if it went from positive to negative,or negative to positive,but it's just staying from positive to positive.So this second derivative was positive,it just touches zero right here,and then it goes positive again.So we're going back to the question,for what X values does the graph of Ghave a point of inflection?No X values.I'll put an exclamation mark there just more drama.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-analyzing-concavity-and-inflection-points/v/mistakes-when-finding-inflection-points-not-checking-candidates	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Olga was asked to findwhere f of x is equal to x minus two to the fourth powerhas inflection points.This is her solution.So we look at her solution and then they ask us,is Olga's work correct?If not, what's her mistake?So pause this video and see if you can figure this out.Alright, let's just follow her work.So here, she's trying to take the first derivative.So you would apply the chain rule.It would be four times x minus two to the third powertimes the derivative of x minus two which is just one.So this checks out.Then you take the derivative of this.It'd be three times four which would be 12times x minus two to the second powertimes the derivative of x minus two which is just onewhich is exactly what she has here,12 times x minus two to the second power.That checks out so step one's looking good for Olga.Step two, the solution of the second derivativeequaling zero is x equals two.That looks right.The second derivative is 12 times x minus two squaredand we wanna make that equal to zero.This is only going to be true when x is equal to two.So step two is looking good.So step three, Olga says f has an inflection pointat x equals two.So she's basing this just on the factthat the second derivative is zero when x is equal to two.She's basing this just on the factthat f prime prime of two is equal to zero.Now, I have a problem with thisbecause the fact that your second derivativeis zero at x equals two,that makes two a nice candidate to check outbut you can't immediately saythat we have an inflection point there.Remember, an inflection point is where we gofrom being concave upwards to concave downwardsor concave downwards to concave upwardsand speaking in the language of the second derivative,it means that the second derivative changes signsas we go from below x equals two to above x equals twobut we have to test thatbecause it's not necessarily always the case.So let's actually test it.Let's think about some intervals.Intervals.So let's think about the intervalwhen we go from negative infinity to twoand let's think about the intervalwhere we go from two to positive infinity.If you want, you could have some test values.You could think about the sign,sign of our second derivativeand then based on that, you could think about concavity,concavity of f.So let's think about what's happening.So you could take a test value.Let's say one is in this intervaland let's say three is in this intervaland you could say one minus two squared is going to be,let's see, that's negative one squared which is oneand then you're just going to, this is just going to be 12so this is going to be positive and if you tried three,three minus two squared is one times 12.Well, that's also going to be positiveand so you're going to be concave upwards.At least in these test values,it looks like on either side of twothat the sign of the second derivativeis positive on either side of the two and you might say,well, maybe I just need to find closer valuesbut if you inspect the second derivative here,you can see that this is never going to be negative.In fact, for any value other than x equals twoand this value right over here since we're,even if x minus two is negative, you're squaring itwhich will make this entire thing positiveand then multiplying it times a positive value.So for any value other than x equals two,the sign of our second derivative is positivewhich means that we're going to be concave upwardsand so we actually don't have an inflection pointat x equals two because we are not switching signsas we go from values less than x equals twoto values greater than x equals two.Our second derivative is not switching sides.So once again, this is incorrect.We actually don't have an inflection point at x equals twobecause our second derivative does not switch signsas we cross x equals twowhich means our concavity does not change.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-second-derivative-test/v/second-derivative-test	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So what I want to do in this videois familiarize ourselves with the second derivative testand before I even get into the nitty-gritty of it,I really just want to get an intuitive feelfor what the second derivative test is telling us.So let me just draw some axes here.So let's say that's my y-axis, let's say this is my x-axisand let's say I have a function that hasa relative maximum value at X equals C.So let's say we have a situationthat looks something like thatand X equals C is right over,so that's the point C, F of C.So if I can draw a straighter dotted line.So that is X being equal to Cand we visually see that we have a local maximum point thereand we can use our calculus toolsto think about what's going on there.Well one thing that we know,we know that the slope of the tangent line,at least the way I've drawn it right over here,is equal to zero.So we could say F prime of C is equal to zeroand the other thing we can seeis that we are concave downwardin the neighborhood around X equals C.So notice our slope is constantly decreasingand since your slope, notice it's positive,it's less positive, even less positive,it goes to zero, then it becomes negative,more negative and even more negative.So we know that F prime prime,we know that F prime prime of Cis less than zeroand so I haven't done any deep mathematical proof here,but if I have a critical point at X equals C,so F prime of C is equal to zero,and we also see that the second derivative thereis less than zero.Well intuitively this makes sensethat we are at a maximum valueand we could go the other wayif we are at a local minimum point at X equals Cor relative minimum point.So our first derivative should still be equal to zero'cause our slope of a tangent line right over thereis still zero.So F prime of C is equal to zero.But in this second situation, we are concave upwards.The slope is constantly increasing.We have an upward opening bowland so here we have a relative minimum valueor we could say our second derivative is greater than zero.Visually we see it's a relative minimum valueand we can tell just looking at our derivatives,at least the way I've drawn it,first derivative is equal to zeroand we are concave upwards.Second derivative is greater than zero.And so this intuition that we hopefully just built upis what the second derivative test tells us.So it says hey look, if we're dealing with some function F,let's say it's a twice differentiable function.So that means that over some interval.So that means that you could find its firstand second derivatives are definedand so let's say there's some point, X equals C,where its first derivative is equal to zero,so the slope of the tangent line is equal to zero,and the derivative exists in a neighborhood around Cand most of the functions we deal with,if it's differentiable at C,it tends to be differentiable in the neighborhood around Cand then we also assume that second derivative existsis twice differentiable.Well then we might be dealing with a maximum point,we might be dealing with a minimum point,or we might not know what we're dealing withand it might be neither a minimum or a maximum point.But using the second derivative test,if we take the second derivative and if we see thatthe second derivative is indeed less than zero,then we have a relative maximum point.Then so this is a situation thatwe started with right up there.If our second derivative is greater than zero,then we are in this situation right here,we're concave upwards.Where the slope is zero, that's the bottom of the bowl.We have a relative minimum pointand if our second derivative is zero, it's inconclusive.We don't know what is actually going on at that point.We can't make any strong statement.So with that out of the way, let's just do a quick examplejust to see if this has gelled.Let's say that I have some twice differentiable function Hand let's say that I tell you thatH of eight is equal to five,I tell you that H prime of eight is equal to zero,and I tell you that the second derivativeat X equals eight is equal to negative four.So given this, can you tell me whetherthe point eight comma five, so the point eight comma five,is it a relative minimum,relative minimum, maximum pointor not enough info?Not enough info or inconclusive?And like always, pause the videoand see if you can figure it out.Well we're assuming it's twice differentiableand I think it's safe to assume thatand for the sake of our problemwe're gonna assume that the derivative existsin a neighborhood around X equals eight.So in this example, C is eight.So point eight five is definitely on the curve.The derivative is equal to zero.So we're dealing potentially with one of these scenariosand our second derivative is less than zero.Second derivative is less than zero.So this threw us.So the fact that the second derivative,so H prime prime of eight is less than zero,tells us that we fall into this situation right over here.So just with the information they've given us,we can say that at the point eight comma fivewe have a relative maximum valueor that this is a relative maximum point for this.If somehow they told us the second derivative was zero,then we would say it's inconclusive.If they told us and that's all they told usand if they told us the second derivativeis greater than zero, then we would be dealingwith a relative minimum value at X equals eight.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-sketching-curves/v/analyzing-a-function-with-its-derivative	khanacademy	video	:00We've got the function f of x is equal to x to the third powerminus 12x plus 2.And what I want to do in this videois think about at what points doesmy function f take on minimum or maximum values?And to figure that out I have to first figure outwhat are the critical points for my function f.And then which of those critical pointsdo we achieve a minimum or maximum value?And to determine the critical pointswe have to find the derivative of our functionbecause our critical points are justthe point at which our derivative is either equal to 0or undefined.So the derivative of this thing right over here,we're just going to use the power rule several times,and then I guess you can call it the constant rule.But the derivative of x to the third is 3x squared.Derivative of negative 12x is negative 12.And the derivative of a constant, itdoesn't change with respect to x,so it's just going to be equal to 0.So we're going to get a critical point whenthis thing right over here, for some value of xis either undefined or 0.Well this thing is defined for all values of x.So the only places we're going to find critical pointsis when this thing is equal to 0.So let's set it equal to 0.When does 3x squared minus 12 equal 0?So let's add 12 to both sides.You get 3x squared is equal to 12.Divide both sides by 3.You get x squared is equal to 4.Well this is going to happen when x is equal to 2and x is equal to negative 2.Just to be clear, f of 2, or let me be clear,f prime of 2, you get 3 times 4 minus 12, which is equal to 0.And f prime negative 2 is also, same exact reason,is also equal to 0.So we can say-- and I'll switch colors here--that f has critical points at x equals 2and x equals negative 2.Well that's fair enough.But we still don't know whether the function takeson a minimum values at those points, maximum valuesof those points, or neither.To figure that out we have to figure outwhether the derivative changes signs around these points.So let's actually try to graph the derivativeto think about this.So let's graph.I'll draw an axis right over here.I'll do it down here because maybe wecan use that information later on to graph f of x.So let's say this is my x-axis.This is my y-axis.And so we have critical points at x is equal to positive 2.So it's 1, 2.And x is equal to negative 2, 1, 2. x is equal to negative 2.So what does this derivative looklike if we wanted to graph it?Well we have when x is equal to 0 for the derivativewe're at negative 12.So this is the point y is equal to negative 12.So this is, we're graphing y is equal to f prime of x.So it looks something like this.These are obviously the 0's of our derivative.So it has to move up to cross the x-axis there and over here.So what is the derivative doing at eachof these critical points?Well over here our derivative is crossing from being positive,we have a positive derivative, to being a negative derivative.So we're crossing from being a positive derivative to beinga negative derivative, that was our criteriafor a critical point to be a maximum point.Over here we're crossing from a negative derivativeto a positive derivative, which isour criteria for a critical point for the functionto have a minimum value at a critical point.So a minimum.And I just want to make sure we have the correct intuition.If our function, if some function is increasinggoing into some point, and at that pointwe actually have a derivative 0--the derivative could also be undefined--but we have a derivative of 0 and then the functionbegins decreasing, that's why this would be a maximum point.Similarly, if we have a situation where the function isdecreasing going into a point, the derivative is negative.Remember this is the graph of the derivative.Let me make this clear.This is the graph of y is equal to not f of x, but f primeof x.So if we have a situation we're going into the point,the function has a negative slope,we see we have a negative slope here-- so the function mightlook something like this.And then right at this point the functionis either undefined or has 0 slope.So in this case it has 0 slope.And then after that point, let me do it right under it.So going into it we have a negative slope.And then right over here we have a 0 slope.Which I could draw it even better than that.So if we were to imagine going into it we havea negative slope, right at that point we have a 0 slope,and then we have a positive slope.So the function begins increasing.That's why we say we have a minimum point right over there.So what I did it right over here isto try to conceptualize what the function itself could looklike given the derivative, in this case switchingfrom a positive derivative to a negative derivative,across that critical point, or goingfrom a negative derivative to a positive derivative.That's why this is the criteria for a maximum point,this is the criteria for a minimum point.Well with that out of the way, can we use this intuitionthat we just talked about to at least tryto sketch the graph of f of x?So let's try to do it.And it's just going to be a sketch,it's not going to be very exact.But at least it'll give us a senseof the shape of what f of x looks like.So my best attempt.So it might not be drawn completely to scale.So it's my x-axis, this is my y-axis.We know we have a critical point at x is equal to positive 2.And we have a critical point at x is equal to negative 2.We know just from inspection that the y-intercept righthere, if the graph of y is equal to fof x, when x is 0 f of x is 2.So we're going to hit right over--I don't want to draw this completelyto the same scale as the x-axis.So let's say that this is 2 right over here.So this is where we're going to cross.This is going to be our y-intercept.And so we said already that we havea maximum point at x is equal to negative 2.So what is f of negative 2? f of negative 2 is equal to 8or negative 8, let me be careful.It's negative 8.And then we're going to have 12 times negative 2, whichis negative 24.But then we're going to add it.So we're subtracting negative 24.So this is plus 24.And then we finally have plus 2.So negative 8 plus 24 plus 2, so that's going to be negative,let's see, negative 8 plus 24 is 16, plus 2 is 18.So f of negative 2 is equal to 18.And I'm not drawing it completely to scale.But let's say that this is 18 right over here.So this is the function.This is the point negative 2 comma 18.And we know that it's a maximum point.The derivative going into that point is negative.The derivative going into that point is negative-- sorry,the derivative going into that point is positive.So we are increasing.The slope is positive.And then after we cross that point,the slope becomes negative.The derivative cross the x-axis, the slope becomes negative.I actually want to use that same color.It looks like this.And then, of course, the graph isgoing to cross the-- it's going to havea y-intercept, something like that.And then, as we approach 2, we areapproaching another critical point.Now what is f of 2?f of 2 is going to be equal to positive 8 minus 24 plus 2.So this is 10 minus 24, which is equal to negative 14.So let's say this is the point negative 14 right over here.Actually I can draw it a little bit.Let's say this is negative 14.So this is f of 2 right over there.And we saw already that the slope is negativeas we approach it.So our function is decreasing as we approach it.And then right there the slope is 0.We figured that out earlier, that'show we identified it being a critical point.And then the slope is increasing after that,the derivative is positive.The slope is increasing.So this is our sketch of what f of xcould look like given that these are the critical points.And we were able to identify 2 as a minimum point.So this was a minimum value.The function takes on a minimum value when x is equal to 2.And the function took on a maximum valuewhen x was equal to negative 2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-connecting-f-f-and-f/v/calculus-based-justification-for-function-increasing	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We are told the differentiable function hand its derivative h prime are graphedand you can see it here, h is in blueand then its derivative h prime is in this orange color.Four students were asked to givean appropriate calculus-based justificationfor the fact that h is increasingwhen x is greater than zero.Can you match the teacher's comments to the justifications?So before I even look at what the students wrote,you might say, hey, look, I can just look at thisand see that h is increasing when x is greater than zerobut just by looking at the graph of h,that by itself is not a calculus-based justification.We're not using calculus.We're just using our knowledgeof what it means for a graph to be increasing.In order for it to be a calculus-based justification,we should use calculus in some way.So maybe use the derivative in some way.Now, you might recognizethat you know that a function is increasingif its derivative is positive.So before I even look at what the students said,what I would say, my calculus-based justification,and I wouldn't even have to see the graph of h,I would just have to see the graph of h primeis to say, look, h prime is greater than,h prime is positive when x is greater than zero.If the derivative is positivethen that means that the slopeof the tangent line is positiveand that means that the graph of the original functionis going to be increasing.Now, let's see whether one of the students said thator what some of the other students wrote.So can you match the teacher's commentsto the justifications?So one student wrote, the derivative of h is increasingwhen x is greater than zero.So it is indeed the case that the derivative is increasingwhen x is greater than zerobut that's not the justification for why h is increasing.For example, the derivative could be increasingwhile still being negativein which case h would be decreasing.The appropriate justification is that h prime is positive,not that it's necessarily increasing'cause you could be increasing and still not be positive.So let's see.I would say that this doesn't justify why h is increasing.When x is greater than zero,as the x-values increase, the function values also increase.Well, that is a justification for why h is increasingbut that's not calculus-based.In no way are you using a derivative.So this isn't a calculus-based justification.It's above the x-axis.So this one, what is it?Are they talking about h?Are they talking about h prime?If they were saying that h prime is above the x-axiswhen x is greater than zero then that would be a good answerbut this is just what is above the x-axisand over what interval?So I would actually, let's scroll down a little bit,this looks like a good thing for the teacher to write.Please use more precise language.This cannot be accepted as a correct justification.And then finally, this last student wrote,the derivative of h is positive when x is greater than zeroand it is indeed the case.If your derivative is positive,that means that your original functionis going to be increasing over that interval.So kudos, you are correct.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-connecting-f-f-and-f/v/identifying-inflection-points-from-graphs-of-function-and-derivatives	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this video is tryto get a graphical appreciation for inflection points,which we also cover in some detail in other videos.So, the first thing to appreciateis an inflection point is a point on our graphwhere our slope goes from decreasing to increasingor from increasing to decreasing.So, right over here I have the graph of some function,and let me draw the slopeof a tangent line at different points.So, when x is equal to negative two,that is what the tangent line looks like.And you can see its slope.And then as we increase x,we can see that the slope is positive, but it is decreasing.Then it goes to zero, and then it goes negative,and the slope keeps decreasing,all the way until we get, it looks like we getto about x equals negative one,and then our slope begins to increase again.So, something interesting happenedright at x equals negative one,and so that's a pretty good indication.We're just doing it graphically here.We're not proving it.But that at this point right over here,we have an inflection point, so let me write that down.So, let me show you that againnow that the point is labeled.For x at negative two, we have a positive slope.It decreases, decreases, decreases.It's negative, it still decreases, x equals negative one,and then our slope begins increasing again.So, that's how you could tell itjust from the function itself.But you could also tell inflection pointsby looking at your first derivative.Remember, an inflection point is when our slope goesfrom increasing to decreasingor from decreasing to increasing.The derivative is just the slope of the tangent line.So, this right over here, this is the derivativeof our original blue function.So, here we can see the interesting parts.And so notice what's happening.On the derivative, the derivative is decreasing,which means the slope of our tangent lineof our original function is decreasing, and we saw that.Notice, while the derivative is decreasing right over here,our slope will be decreasing.Our slope is positive.Our slope is positive, but decreasing.Then it becomes negative, but decreasing,all the way until this point,which is at x equals negative one.So, let's do that again.So, our slope is positive and decreasing,and then right over about there, right over here,our slope keeps decreasing,but then it actually turns negative.And it keeps decreasing all the wayuntil x equals negative one,and then our slope begins increasing again.So, the derivative begins increasing,which means the slope of our tangent lineof our original function begins increasing.So, that point is interesting.An inflection point, one way to identify an inflection pointfrom the first derivative is to look at a minimum pointor to look at a maximum point, because that shows a placewhere your derivative is changing direction.It's going from increasing to decreasing,or in this case from decreasing to increasing,which tells you that this is likely an inflection point.Now, let's think about the second derivative.So, right over here,this is the derivative of the derivative.And I could zoom out to look at the whole thing.You actually can't see the whole thing right over here.Actually, I can zoom out a little bit moreso that you can really see what's going on.And so what's interesting here?Well, it looks like right at x equals negative one,we cross, our second derivative crosses the x axis,so let me label that.So, right over there, we cross the x axis,which is exactly where we have the inflection point.And that makes sense,because if our second derivative goesfrom being negative to positive,that means our first derivative goesfrom being decreasing to increasing,which means the slope of our tangent lineof our function goes from decreasing to increasing.We've seen that over and over,decreasing to increasing right over here.Now, it's important to realizethe second derivative doesn't need to just touch the x axis.It needs to cross it.So, you might say,""Well, what about this point right over here, two, zero?""The second derivative touches the x axis there,but it doesn't cross it,so we never go from our derivative increasingto our derivative decreasing.So, big takeaways,you could figure out the inflection pointfrom either the graph of the function,from the graph of the derivative,or the graph of the second derivative.On the function itself,you just wanna inspect the slopes of the tangent lineand think about where does it gofrom decreasing to increasing?Or the other way around, from increasing to decreasing.If you're looking at the first derivative,you really just wanna look at minimum or maximum points.And if you're looking at the second derivative,which have we in orange, you wanna look atat what x value are we crossing the x axis?Not just touching it, but crossing the x axis."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-connecting-f-f-and-f/v/justification-for-inflection-point	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The twice differentiable function Gand its second derivative G prime prime are graphed.And you can see it right over here.I'm actually working off of the articleon Khan Academy calledJustifying Using Second Derivatives.So we see our function G.And we see not its first derivativebut its second derivative herein this brown color.So then, the article goes on to say,or the problem goes on to say,four students were asked to give an appropriatecalculus-based justification for the factthat G has an inflection point at X equals negative two.So let's just feel good that at least intuitivelyit feels right.So X equals negative two, remember whatan inflection point is.It's where we're going from concave downwardsto concave upwards.Or, concave upwards to concave downwards.Or another way to think about itit's a situation whereour slope goes from decreasing to increasing,or from increasing to decreasing.And when we look at it over here, it looks likeour slope is decreasing, it's positive,but it's decreasing, it goes to zero.Then it keeps decreasing, it becomesit's negative now.It keeps decreasing until we get to aboutX equals negative twoand then it seems that it's increasing,it's getting less and less and less and less negative.It looks like it's a zero right over herethen it just keeps increasing, it gets moreand more and more positive.So it does, indeed, look like at X equals negative twowe go from being concave downwardsto concave upwards.Now a calculus based justificationis we could look at its, at the second derivativeand see where the second derivativecrosses the X-axis.Because where the second derivative is negativethat means our slope is decreasingwe are concave downwards.And where the second derivative is positiveit means our first derivativeis increasing, our slope of our original functionis increasing and we are concave upwards.So notice, we do indeed, the second derivativedoes indeed cross the X-axisat X equals negative two.It's not enough for it to just be zeroor touch the X-axis,it needs to cross the X-axis in order for usto have an inflection point there.So given that, let's look at the studentsin justifications and seewhat we can, if we can kind of playput the teacher hat in our mindand say what a teacher would sayfor the different justifications.So the first one says, the second derivative of Gchanges signs at X equals negative two.Well that's exactly what we were just talking about.If the second derivative changes signsin this case, it goes from negative to positive,that means our first derivative went fromdecreasing to increasing.Which is indeed, good for saying this is acalculus-based justification.So, at least for now I'm gonna putkudos you are correct there.It crosses the X-axis.So this is ambiguous.What is crossing the X-axis?If a student wrote this I'd say,what are they talking about, the function,are they talking about the first derivative,the second derivative.And so I would say, please use more precise language.This cannot be accepted as a correct justification.I will read the other ones.The second derivative of G isincreasing at X equalsnegative two.Well no, that doesn't justifywhy you have an inflection point there.For example,the second derivative is increasingat X equals negative 2.5.The second derivative is even increasingat X equalsnegative one.But you don't have an inflection pointat those places.So I would say, this doesn't justifywhy G has an inflection point.And then the last student response,the graph of G changes concavityat X equals negative two.That is truebut that isn't a calculus-based justification.We'd want to use our second derivative here.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-connecting-f-f-and-f/v/calculus-based-justification-using-second-derivative-max	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We're told that given that h primeof negative four is equal to zero,what is an appropriate calculus-based justificationfor the fact that h has a relative maximumat x is equal to negative four?So right over here,we actually have the graph of our function h.This is the graph y is equal to h of x.And we don't have graphed the first derivative,but we do have graphed the second derivativeright here in this orange color, h prime prime.So they're telling us,given that h prime of negative four is equal to zero,so that's saying that given that the first derivativeat x equals negative four is equal to zero,and you can see that the slope of the tangent linewhen x is equal to negative four does indeed equal zero.So given that, what is a calculus-based,let me underline that, a calculus-based justificationfor the fact that h has a relative maximumat x equals negative four?So this first one says that the second derivativeat x equals negative four is negative.Now, what does that tell us?If the second derivative is negative,that means that the first derivative is decreasing,which is another way of saying that we are dealingwith a situation where, at least at x equals negative four,we are concave downwards,downwards, which means that the general shape of our curveis going to look something like thisaround x equals negative four.And if the slope at x equals negative four is zero,well, that tells us that, yes, we indeed are dealingwith a relative maximum point.If the second derivative at that point was positive,then we would be concave upwards.And then if our derivative is zero there,we'd say, okay, that's a relative minimum point.But this is indeed true.The second derivative is negative at x equals negative four,which means we are concave downwards,which means that we are a upside U,and that point where the derivative is zerois indeed a relative maximum.So let me, so that is the answer.And we're done, but let's just rule out the other ones.H increase before x equals negative four.That is indeed true.Before x equals negative four, we are increasing,and h decreases after it.That is true, and that is one rationale for thinking that,hey, we must have a maximum point,assuming that our function is continuousat x equals negative four.So this is true.It is a justification for a relative maximum,but it is not calculus-based.And so that's why we can rule this one out.The second derivative has a relative minimumat x equals negative four.Well, it does indeed seem to be true.There's a relative minimum there,but that's not a justification for whythis is why h of negative fouror why we have a relative maximum at x equals negative four.For example, this,you could have a relative minimum in your second derivative,but your second derivative could still be positive there.So what if the second derivative was like that?That would still be a relative minimum.But if it was positive at that point,then you would be concave upwards,which would mean that at x equals negative four,your original function wouldn't have a maximum point,it would have a minimum point.And so just a relative minimum isn't enough.In order to know that you are dealingwith a relative maximum, you would have to knowthat the second derivative is negative there.Now, this fourth choice, h prime prime is concave up,it does indeed look like the second derivativeis concave up, but that, by itself, does not justifythat the original function is concave up.For example, well, I could use this example right here.This is a potential second derivativethat is concave upwards,but it is positive the entire time.And if your second derivative is positive the entire time,that means that your first derivativeis increasing the entire time,which means that your original functionis going to be concave upwards the entire time.And so if you're concave upwards the entire time,then you would not have a relative maximumat x equals negative four.So we would rule that one out as well.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-connecting-f-f-and-f/v/connecting-function-and-derivatives-graphically-exp	khanacademy	video	:00- [Narrator] We have the graph of three functions here.And we're told that one of them is the function F,one is its' first derivative, and then one of them is thesecond derivative.We just don't know which one is which.And so, like always, pause this video and see if youcan figure it out.Alright, now the way I'm going to tackle it isI'm gonna look at each of these graphs andtry to think, what would their derivatives look like.So for this first one, we can see our derivativeright over here, our slope of our tangent line.It would be a little bit negative and then it gets moreand more and more negative,and as we approach this vertical asymptote, right over here,it looks like it's approaching negative infinity.So, the derivative would actually, over here,it would be a little bit less than zero,but then it would get more and more and more negativeand then it would approach negative infinity.So, it would have a similar shape, general shape,to the graph itself, at least to the left of thisvertical asymptote.Now, what about to the right of the vertical asymptote?Right to the right of the vertical asymptote it looks likethe slope of the tangent line is very negative, but thenit becomes less and less and less negative,and it looks like it is approaching, it is approaching zero.So, on this side the derivative starts out super negativeand then it looks like it is the derivative is going toasymptote towards zero, something like that.So, based on what I just sketched,it looks like this right graph is a good candidatefor the derivative of this left graph.You might say, what's wrong with this blue graph?Well this blue graph out here, notice that it's positive.So if this were the derivative of the left graph,then that means the left graph would need a positive slopeout here, but it doesn't have a positive slope.It's a slightly negative slope becoming super negative.And so, right here we're slightly negativeand then we become very negative.And so maybe this is,let's call this F,and maybe this is F prime.This is F prime right over here.And now, let's look at this middle graph.What would its derivative do?So over here, our slope is slightly negative,and then it becomes more and more and more and moreand more negative.And so the derivative of this might look like,it has to be slightly negative,but then it gets more and more and more and more negativeas we approach that vertical asymptote.And then on the right side of the vertical asymptote,our derivative is very positive here,and then it gets less and less and less and lessand less and less positive.And so, we start our derivative would be very positiveand then it would get less and less and lessand less positive.It looks like it might, the slope might asymptotingtowards zero, so our graph might look something like that.Well the left graph right herelooks a lot like what I just sketched outas a candidate derivative for this blue graph,for this middle graph.And so I would say that this is F,then this is the derivative of that,which would make it F prime and then we already establishedthat this right graph is the derivative of the left one,so if it's the derivative of F prime,it's not F prime itself, it's the second derivative.So I feel pretty good about that.And just for good measure, we could think aboutwhat the derivative of this graph would look like.Here the slope is slightly negative,but then it gets more and more and more and more and morenegative, so the derivative would have a similar shape here.And then here, our derivative would be very positive,and it gets less and less and less and lessand less positive.And so, we start very positive and then it gets lessand less and less and less and less positive.And so as a general shape, it actually does look a lot likethis first graph.But the reason why I'm not gonna say that this first graphis the derivative of the right hand graph,is because this right hand graph was the only good candidatethat we had for the derivative of the left hand graph.And so I feel pretty good with what we selected,that this middle one is F, the left oneis the first derivative, and the right oneis the second derivative.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/minimizing-sum-of-squares	khanacademy	video	:00We are being asked, what is the smallest-- thisis a little typo here-- what is the smallestpossible sum of squares of two numbersif their product is negative 16?So let's say that these two numbers are x and y.So how could we define the sum of the squares of the twonumbers?So I'll just call that the sum of the squares,s for sum of the squares, and it would justbe equal to x squared plus y squared.And this is what we want to minimize.We want to minimize s.Now, right now s is expressed as a function of x and y.We don't know how to minimize with respect to two variables,so we have to get this in terms of only one variable.And lucky for us, they give us another piece of information.Their product is negative 16.So x times y is equal to negative 16.So let's say we wanted this expressionright over here only in terms of x.Well, then we can figure out whaty is in terms of x and then substitute.So let's do that right over here.If we divide both sides by x, we get y is equal to negative 16over x.And so let's replace our y in this expressionwith negative 16 over x.So then we would get our sum of squaresas a function of x is going to beequal to x squared plus y squared.y is negative 16 over x.And then that's what we will now square.So this is equal to x squared plus, what is this?256 over x squared.Or we could write that as 256x to the negative 2 power.That is the sum of our squares that we now want to minimize.Well, to minimize this, we would wantto look at the critical points of this, whichis where the derivative is either 0 or undefined,and see whether those critical points are possiblya minimum or a maximum point.They don't have to be, but those arethe ones if we have a minimum or a maximum point,they're going to be one of the critical points.So let's take the derivative.So the derivative s prime-- let medo this in a different color-- s prime of x.I'll do it right over here, actually.The derivative s prime of x with respectto x is going to be equal to 2x timesnegative 2 times 2x plus 256 times negative 2.So that's minus 512x to the negative 3 power.Now, this is going to be undefined when x is equal to 0.But if x is equal to 0, then y is undefined.So this whole thing breaks down.So that isn't a useful critical point, x equals 0.So let's think about any other ones.Well, it's defined everywhere else.So let's think about where the derivative is equal to 0.So when does this thing equal 0?So when does 2x minus 512x to the negative 3 equal 0?Well, we can add 512x to the negative 3 to both sides.So you get 2x is equal to 512x to the negative third power.We can multiply both sides times x to the third powerso all the x's go away on the right-hand side.So you get 2x to the fourth is equal to 512.We can divide both sides by 2, and youget x to the fourth power is equal to 256.And so what is the fourth root of 256?Well, we could take the square root of both sides justto help us here.So let's see.So it's going to be x squared is going to be equal to 256is 16 squared.So this is 16.This is going to be x squared is equal to 16 or x is equal to 4.Now that's our only critical point we have,so that's probably the x value thatminimizes our sum of squares right over here.But let's make sure it's a minimum value.And to do that, we can just do our second derivative test.So let's figure out.Let's take the second derivative sprime prime of x and figure out if we are concave upwardsor downwards when x is equal to 4.So s prime prime of x is going to be equal to 2.And then we're going to have negative 3 times negative 512.So I'll just write that as plus 3 times 512.That's going to be 1,536.Is that right?Yeah, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 12is 36, x to the negative 4 power.And this thing right over here is actuallygoing to be positive for any x.x to the negative 4, even if the negative x value,that's going to be positive.Everything else is positive.This thing is always positive.So we are always in a concave upwards situation.Concave upwards means that our graph might look somethinglike that.Actually, I don't want to draw the little squiggle.It might look something like that.And you see there's a reason why the second derivative impliesconcave upwards, a second derivative positivemeans that our derivative is constantly increasing.So the derivative is constantly increasing.It's negative, less negative, even less negative.Let me do it in a different color.You see it's negative, less negative, even less negative,0, positive, more positive.So it's increasing over the entire place.So if you have a critical point wherethe derivative is equal to 0, so the slope is equal to 0,and it's concave upwards, you see pretty clearlythat we have minimized the function.So what is y going to be equal to?We actually don't even have to figure outwhat y has to be equal to in orderto minimize the sum of squares.We could just put it back into this.But just for fun, we see that y would be negative 16 over x.So y would be equal to negative 4.And we could just figure out now what our sum of squares is.Our minimum sum of squares is goingto be equal to 4 squared, which is 16 plus negative 4squared plus another 16, which is equal to 32.Now I know some of you might be thinking, hey,I could have done this without calculus.I could have just tried out numbers whose product isnegative 16 and I probably would have tried out 4 and negative 4in not too much time and then I wouldhave been able to maybe figure out it's lower than if I did2 and negative 8 or negative 2 and 8 or 1 and 16.And that's true, you probably wouldhave been able to do that.But you still wouldn't have been able to feel goodthat that was a minimum value, because you wouldn'thave tried out 4.01 or 4.0011.In fact, you couldn't have tried out all of the possible values.Remember, we didn't say that this is only integers.It just happened to be that our values just worked outto be integers in this situation.You can imagine what would happen if the problem wasn'tif their product is negative 16, but whatif their product is negative 17?Or what if the product is negative 16.5?Or what if their product was pi squared?Then you wouldn't be able to try everything else outand you would have to resort to doingwhat we did in this video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/optimizing-box-volume-graphically	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that we have a sheet of cardboardthat is 20 inches by 30 inches.Let me draw the cardboard as neatly as I can.So it might look something like that.So that is my sheet of cardboard.And just to make sure we know the dimensions,there's 20 inches by 30 inches.And what we're going to do is cutout the corners of this cardboard.And all the corners are going to be squares,and we're going to cut out an x by x cornerfrom each of the corners of this piece of cardboard-- x by x.Over here, x by x, and then over here, x by x.And what we'll do is after we cut out those corners,we can essentially fold down the flaps.Let me draw the flap.So you could imagine we can fold right there,we could fold right there, we could fold right there,and we would form a box.I guess you could imagine a box without a bottom to it,or you can view a box without a top to it.So if we were to fold everything up,we would get a container that looks something like this.Let me make my best attempt to draw it.So it would look like this.This is one flap folded up.You can imagine this flap right over here,if I were to fold it up like that,it now would look like this.It would now look like this.The height of the flap is x.So this distance right over here is x.And then if I were to fold this flap, if I were-- letme do that a little bit neater.If I were to fold this flap right over here,if I were to fold that up, then it would look like this.Let me make my best attempt to draw it.It would look like that.And then I would fold that back flap up.So the back flap would look something like that.That would be the back flap.It would look something like that.And then this flap over here would--if I fold it up would look something like that.And then of course, my base of my whole thing,so this whole region right over here of my piece of cardboard,would be the floor of this box that I'm constructing.And what I want to do is I want to maximizethe volume of this box.I want to maximize how much it can hold.And I want to maximize it by picking my x appropriately.So let's think about what the volume of this boxis as a function of x.Well, in order to do that, we haveto figure out all the dimensions of this box as a function of x.We already know that this corner right over here,which is made up of when this side and this sideconnect when you fold these two flaps up,that's going to be the same height over there.That's going to be the same height over there.The height of this box is going to be x.But what's the width?What is the width of this box going to be?Well, the width of the box is goingto be this distance right over here.And this distance is going to be 20 inches minus not 1x,but minus 2 x's.So this is going to be 20 minus 2x.You see it right over here.This whole distance is 20.You subtract this x, you subtract this x,and you get this distance right over here.So it's 20 minus 2x.Now, the same logic, what is the depth of the box?What is that distance right over there?Well, that distance is this distance right over here.We know that this entire distance is 30 inches.If we subtract out this x and we subtract out this x,we get the distance that we care about.So this is going to be 30 minus 2x.So now we have all of the dimensions.So what would the volume be as a function of x?Well, the volume as a function of xis going to be equal to the height, whichis x, times the width, which is 20 minus x-- sorry, 20minus 2x times the depth, which is 30 minus 2x.Now, what are possible values of x that give us a valid volume?Well, x can't be less than 0.You can't make a negative cut here.Somehow we would have to add cardboard or something there.So we know that x is going to be greater than or equal to 0.So let me write this down.x is going to be greater than or equal to 0.And what does it have to be less than?Well, I can cut at most-- we can see herethe length right over here, this pink color, this mauve color,is 20 minus 2x.So this has got to be greater than 0.This is always going to be shorter than the 30 minus 2x,but the 20 minus 2x has to be greater than or equal to 0.You can't cut more cardboard than there is.Or you could say that 20 has to be greater than or equal to 2x,or you could say that 10 is goingto be greater than or equal to x, whichis another way of saying that x is going to be less thanor equal to 10.That's a different shade of yellow.x is going to be less than or equal to 10.So x has got to be between 0 and 10.Otherwise we've cut too much, or we're somehowadding cardboard or something.So first let's think about the volume at the endpointsof our-- essentially of our domain, of what xcan be for our volume.Well, our volume when x is equal to 0 is equal to what?We can have 0 times all of this stuff.And it's pretty obvious.You're not going to have any height here.So you're not going to have any volume,so our volume would be 0.What is our volume when x is equal to 10?Well, if x equaled 10, then the width herethat I've drawn in pink would be 0.So once again, we would have no volume.And this term right over here, if we just look atit algebraically would also be, equal to 0,so this whole thing would be equal to 0.So someplace in between x equals 0 and x equals10 we should achieve our maximum volume.And before we do it analytically with a bit of calculus,let's do it graphically.So I'll get my handy TI-85 out.So let me get my TI-85 out.And so first let me set my range appropriatelybefore I attempt to graph it.So I'll put my graph function.Let me set my range.So my minimum x-value, let me make that 0.We know that x cannot be less than 0.My maximum x-value, well, 10 seems pretty good.My minimum y-value, this is essentiallygoing to be my volume.I'm not going to have negative volume,so let me set that equal 0.And my maximum y-value, let's seewhat would be reasonable here.I'm just going to pick some a random xand see what type of a volume I get.So if x were to be 5, it would be 5 times 20 minus 10,which is 10.So that would be-- did I do that right?Yeah, 20 minus 2 times 5, so thatwould be 10, and then times 30 minus 2 times 5, whichwould be 20.So it would be 5 times 10 times 20.So you'd get a volume of 1,000 cubic inches.And I just randomly picked the number 5.So let me give my maximum y-value a little higherthan that just in case to that isn't the maximum value.I just randomly picked that.So let's say yMax is 1,500, and if for whatever reasonour graph doesn't fit in there, thenmaybe we can make our yMax even larger.So I think this is going to be a decent range.Now let's actually input the function itself.So our volume is equal to x times 20minus 2x minus 2x times 30 minus 2x.And that looks about right.So now I think we can graph it.So 2nd, and I want to select that up there,so I'll do Graph.And it looks like we did get the right range.So this tells us volume is a function of x between x is 0and x is 10, and it does look like we hit a maximum pointright around there.So what I'm going to do is I'm goingto use the Trace function to figure out roughlywhat that maximum point is.So let me trace this function.So I can still go higher, higher.OK.So over there my volume is 1,055.5.Then I can get to 1,056.So let's see, this was 1,056.20, this is 1,056.24,then I go back to 1,055.So at least based on the level of zoomthat I have my calculator right now,this is a pretty good approximationfor the maximum value that my function actually takes on.So it looks like my maximum value is around 1,056,and it happens at around x equals 3.89.So it looks like my volume at 3.89is approximately equal to 1,056 cubic inches.Or you could say that we hit a maximum whenx is approximately equal to 3.89.So far, we've just set up our maximization problem,and we've looked at it graphically.In the next video, we'll try to solve it analyticallyusing some of our calculus tools.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/optimizing-box-volume-analytically	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we were able to get a pretty good senseabout how large of an x we should cut out of each cornerin order to maximize our volume.And we did this graphically.What I want to do in this video isuse some of our calculus tools to see if we can come upwith the same or maybe even a better result.So to do that, I'm going to have to figure outthe critical points of our volume as a function of x.And to do that, I need to take the derivative of the volume.So let me do that.And before I even do that, it'll simplify thingsso I don't have to use the product rule in some wayand then have to simplify that, letme just multiply this expression out.So let's rewrite volume as a function of x is equal to--and I'll write it all in yellow.So it's going to be x times-- I'llmultiply these two binomials first.So 20 times 30 is 600.Then I have 20 times negative 2x, which is negative 40x.Then I have negative 2x times 30, which is negative 60x.And then I have negative 2x times negative 2x,which is positive 4x squared.So this part over here simplifiesand I can change the order to 4x squared minus 100x plus 600.I just switched the order in which I'm writing them.So that's that.And so I can rewrite the volume of xas being equal to x times all of this business, which is-- letme make sure I have enough space,let me do it a little higher-- whichis equal to 4x to the third power minus 100x squaredplus 600x.And that'll be pretty straightforward to takethe derivative.So let's say that v prime of x is going to be equal to-- Ijust have used the power rule multiple times-- so 4 times 3is 12.x to the 3 minus 1 power 12x squared minus 200 timesx to the first power, which is just x, plus 600.And so now we just have to figure outwhen this is equal to 0.So we have to figure out when 12x squaredminus 200x plus 600 is equal to 0.What x values gets my derivative to be equal to 0?When is my slope equal to 0?I could also look for critical pointswhere the derivative is undefined,but this derivative is defined especiallythroughout my domain of x that I care about, between 0 and 10.So I could try to factor this or tryto simplify this a little bit.But I'm just going to cut to the chaseand try to use the quadratic formula here.So this is, the x's that satisfy thisis going to be x is going to be equal to-- So negative b.So it's 200.Negative, negative 200 is positive 200.Plus or minus the square root of b squared,which is negative 200 squared.So I could just write that as 200 squared.Doesn't matter if it's negative 200 squared or 200 squared,I'm going to get the same value.So let me give myself some more space.So negative 200 squared.Well, that's going to be 4 with 4 0's.1, 2, 3, 4.So that's going to be 40,000 minus 4ac.So minus 4 times 12, 12 times 600--I still didn't give myself enough space-- times 600.All of that over 2 times a.So all of that over 24.And I'll take out the calculator again to try to calculate this.So let me get out of graphing mode.All right, so first I'll try when I add the radical.So I'm going to get 200 plus the square root of 40,000.I could have just written that as 200 squared,but that's fine.40,000 minus 4 times 12 times 600.And I get 305, which I then need to divide by 24.Which I'll divide by 24, and I get 12.74.So one of my possible x's.So it equals 12.74.And now let me do the situation whereI subtract what I had in the radical sign.So let me get my calculator back.And so now let me do 200-- I probablycould have done this slightly more efficiently,but this is fine-- minus the square root of 40,000-- 1, 2,3-- minus 4 times 12 times 600.And I get that's just the numerator.And then I'm going to divide that by 24, and I get 3.92.Did I do that right?200 minus 40,000 minus 4 times 12 times 600, all of thatdivided by 24.My previous answer divided by 24 gives me 3.92.So it's 12.74 or 3.92.Now which of these can I use?Well x equals 12.74 is outside of our valid values for x.If x was equal to 12.74, the x's wouldstart to overlap with each other.So x cannot be 12.74.So we get a critical point at x is equal to 3.92.And you could look at the graph and you could say, oh,well look, that looks like a maximum value.But if you didn't have the graph at your disposal,you can then do the second derivative testand say, hey, are we concave upwards or concave downwardswhen x is equal to 3.92?Well, in order to do the second derivative test,you have to figure out the second derivative is.So let's do that. b prime prime of xis going to be equal to 24x, 24 times x to the first,minus 200.And you can just look at inspectionthat this number right over here is less than 4.So this thing right over here is going to be less than 100.You subtract 200.So we can write the second derivative at 3.92is going to be less than 0.You can figure out what the exact value is if you like.So because this is less than 0, we are concave downwards.Another way of saying it is the slopeis decreasing the entire time.Concave downwards.When the slope is decreasing the entire time,our shape looks like that.The slope could start off high, lower, lower, gets to 0,even lower, lower, lower.And we even saw that on the graph right over here.And since it's concave downwards,that implies that our critical point thatsits where the interval is concave downward,that critical point is a local maximum.So this is the x value at which our functionattains our maximum.Now what is that maximum value?Well, we could type that back in into our original expressionfor volume to figure what that is.So let's figure out what the volume when we get to 3.92is equal to.What is our maximum volume?So get the calculator back out.It's obviously roughly 3.92.I could use this exact value.Actually, I'll just use 3.92 to get a rough sense of whatour maximum value is, our maximum volume.So it'll be 3.92.I'll just use this expression for the volumeas a function of x.3.92 times 20 minus 2 times 3.92 times 30 minus 2 times 3.92gives us-- and we deserve a drum roll now-- gives us 1,056.3.So 1,056.3, which is a higher volumethen we got when we just inspected it graphically.We probably could have gotten a little bit more preciseif we zoomed in some and then we would have gotten a little bitbetter of an answer, but there you have it.Analytically, we were able to actually getan even better answer than we wereable to do at least on that first pass graphically.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/optimizing-profit-at-a-shoe-factory	khanacademy	video	:00You've opened up a shoe factory and you'retrying to figure out how many thousands of pairs of shoesto produce in order to optimize your profit.And so let's let x equal the thousands of pairs produced.Now let's think about how much moneyyou're going to make per pair.Actually, let me say how much revenue,which is how much you actually get to sell those shoes for.So let's write a function right here.Revenue as a function of x.Well, you have a wholesaler who'swilling to pay you $10 per pair for as many pairsas you're willing to give him.So your revenue as a function of x is going to be 10 times x.And since x is in thousands of pairs produced, if x is 1,that means 1,000 pairs produced times 10, which means $10,000.But this will just give you 10.So this right over here is in thousands of dollars.So if x is 1, that means 1,000 pairs produced.10 times 1 says r is equal to 10,but that really means $10,000.Now, it would be a nice business if all youhad was revenue and no costs.But you do have costs.You have materials, you have to build your factory,have to pay your employees, you haveto pay the electricity bill.And so you hire a bunch of consultantsto come up with what your cost is as a function of x.And they come up with a function.They say it is the number of the thousands of pairs you producecubed minus 6 times the thousands of pairs you producesquared plus 15 times the thousands of pairsthat you produce.And once again, this is also goingto be in thousands of dollars.Now, given these functions of x for revenue and cost,what is profit as a function of x going to be?Well, your profit as a function of xis just going to be equal to your revenue as a function of xminus your cost as a function of x.If you produce a certain amount and let'ssay you bring in, I don't know, $10,000 of revenueand it costs you $5,000 to produce those shoes,you'll have $5,000 in profit.Those numbers aren't the ones that would actuallyyou would get from this right here.I'm just giving you an example.So this is what you want to optimize.You want to optimize p as a function of x.So what is it?I've just said it here in abstract terms,but we know what r of x is and what's c of x.This is 10x minus all of this business.So minus x to the third plus 6x squared minus 15x.I just subtracted x squared, you subtract6x squared it becomes positive, you subtract a 15x it becomesnegative 15x, and then we can simplify this as-- let's see,we have negative x to the third plus 6xsquared minus 15x plus 10x, so that is minus 5x.Now if we want to optimize this profit function analytically,the easiest way is to think about whatare the critical points of this profit functionand are any of those critical pointsminimum points or maximum points?And if one of them is a maximum point, then we can say,well, let's produce that many.That is going to be-- we will have optimizedor we will figure out the quantity we need to producein order to optimize our profit.So to figure out critical points,we essentially have to find the derivative of our functionand figure out when does that derivative equal 0or when is that derivative undefined?That's the definition of critical points.So p prime of x is going to be equal to negative 3xsquared plus 12x minus 5.And so this thing is going to be defined for all x.So the only critical points we're going to haveis when the first derivative right over here is equal to 0.So negative 3x squared plus 12x minus 5 needs to be equal to 0in order for x to be a critical point.So now we just have to solve for x.And so we just are essentially solving a quadratic equation.Just so that I don't have as many negatives,let's multiply both sides by negative 1.I just like to have a clean first coefficient.So if we multiply both sides by negative 1,we get 3x squared minus 12x plus 5 is equal to 0.And now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x.So x is going to be equal to negative b, which is 12,plus or minus the square root.I always need to make my radical signs wide enough.The square root of b squared, whichis 144, minus 4 times a, which is 3, times c, which is 5.All of that over 2a.So 2 times 3 is 6.So x is equal to 12 plus or minusthe square root of, let's see, 4 times 3 is 12 times 5 is 60.144 minus 60 is 84.All of that over 6.So x could be equal to 12 plus the square root of 84 over 6or x could be equal to 12 minus the square root of 84 over 6.So let's figure out what these two are.And I'll use a calculator.I'll use the calculator for this one.So I get, let's see, 12 plus the square root of 84 divided by 6gives me 3.5-- I'll just say 3.53.So approximately 3.-- Actually, let mego one more digit, because I'm talking about thousands.So let me say 3.528.So this would literally be 3,528 shoes,because this is in thousands, or pairs of shoes.And then let's do the situation where we subtract.And actually we can look at our previous entryand just change this to a subtraction.Change that to not a negative sign, a subtraction.There you go.And we get 0.4725.Let me remember that.0.4725.Approximately equal to 0.4725.I have a horrible memory, so let mereview that I wrote the same thing.4725.Yep.All right.Now these are all we know about these,or these are both critical points.These are points at which our derivative is equal to 0.But we don't know whether they're minimum points,they're points at which the function takeson a minimum value, a maximum value, or neither.To do that, I'll use the second derivative testto figure out if our function is concave upwardsor concave downwards or neither at one of these points.So let's look at the second derivative.So p prime prime of x is going to beequal to negative 6x plus 12.And so if we look at-- let me make sure I have enough space.So if we look at p prime prime of 3.528.So let's see if I can think this through.So this is between 3 and 4.So if we take the lower value, 3 times negative 6is negative 18 plus 12 is going to be less than 0.And if this was 4 it'd be even more negative,so this thing is going to be less than 0.Don't even have to use my calculator to evaluate it.Now what about this thing right over here?0.47.Well, 0.47, that's roughly 0.5.So negative 6 times 0.5 is negative 3.This is going to be nowhere close to being negative.This is definitely going to be positive.So p prime prime of 0.4725 is greater than 0.So the fact that the second derivative is less than 0,that means that my derivative is decreasing.My first derivative is decreasingwhen x is equal to this value, whichmeans that our graph, our function,is concave downwards here.And concave downwards means it looks something like this.And so you can see what it looks something like that,the slope is constantly decreasing.So if you have an interval where the slope is decreasingand you know the point where the slope is exactly 0, whichis where x is equal to 3.528, it must be a maximum.So we actually do take on a maximum value when x is 3.528.On the other side we see that over here we'reconcave upwards.The graph will look something like this over here.And if the slope is 0 where the graph looks like that,we see that that is a local minimum.And so we definitely don't want to do this.We would produce 472 and 1/2 unitsif we were looking to minimize our profit, maximize our loss.So we definitely don't want to do this.But let's actually think about whatour profit is going to be if we produce3.528 thousands of shoes, or 3,528 shoes.Well, to do that we just have to input it backinto our original profit function right over here.So let's do that.So I get my calculator out.So my original profit function is right over there.So I want to be able to see that and that.So I get negative 3.528 to the third power plus 6 times 3.528squared minus 5 times 3.528 gives me--and we get a drum roll now-- gives me a profit of 13.128.So let me write this down.The profit when I produce 3,528 shoes is approximately equal toor it is equal to, if I produce exactly that many shoes,it's equal to 13.128.Or actually it's approximately, because I'm stillrounding 13.128.So if I produce 3,528 shoes in a given period,I'm going to have a profit of $13,128.Remember, this right over here is in thousands,this right over here is 13.128 thousandsof dollars in profit, which is $13,128.Anyway, we are now going to be rich shoe manufacturers.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/expression-for-combined-area-of-triangle-and-square	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that I have a 100 meter long wire.So that is my wire right over there.And it is 100 meters.And I'm going to make a cut someplace on this wire.And so let's say I make the cut right over there.With the left section of wire-- I'mgoing to obviously cut it in two-- with the left section,I'm going to construct an equilateral triangle.And with the right section, I'm going to construct a square.And my question for you and for meis, where do we make this cut in orderto minimize the combined areas of this triangleand this square?Well, let's figure out.Let's define a variable that we're trying to minimize,or that we're trying to optimize with respect to.So let's say that the variable x is the number of metersthat we decide to cut from the left.So if we did that, then this length for the trianglewould be x meters, and the length for the squarewould be, well, if we use x up for the left hand side,we're going to have 100 minus x for the right hand side.And so what would the dimensions of the triangle and the squarebe?Well, the triangle sides are going to be x over 3, x over 3,and x over 3 as an equilateral triangle.And the square is going to be 100 minus x over 4by 100 minus x over 4.Now it's easy to figure out an expressionfor the area of the square in terms of x.But let's think about what the area of an equilateral trianglemight be as a function of the length of its sides.So let me do a little bit of an aside right over here.So let's say we have an equilateral triangle.Just like that.And its sides are length s, s, and s.Now we know that the area of a triangleis 1/2 times the base times the height.So in this case, the height we couldconsider to be altitude, if we were to drop an altitude justlike this.This length right over here, this is the height.And this would be perpendicular, just like that.So our area is going to be equal to one half times our base iss.1/2 times s times whatever our height is, times our height.Now how can we express h as a function of s?Well, to do that we just have to remind ourselvesthat what we've drawn over here is a right triangle.It's the left half of this equilateral triangle.And we know what this bottom side of this right triangle is.This altitude splits this side exactly into two.So this right over here has length s over 2.So to figure out what h is, we could justuse the Pythagorean theorem.We would have h squared plus s over 2 squared plus sover 2 squared is going to be equal to the hypotenusesquared, is going to be equal to s squared.So you would get h squared plus s squared over 4is equal to s squared.Subtract s squared over 4 from both sides,and you get h squared is equal s squared minus s squared over 4.Now, to do this I could call it s squared.I could call this 4s squared over 4,just to be able to have a common denominator.And 4s squared minus s squared over 4is going to be equal to 3s squared over 4.So we get h squared is equal to 3s squared over 4.Now we can take the principal root of both sides,and we get h is equal to the square rootof 3 times s over 2.So now we can just substitute back right over hereand we get our area.Our area is equal to 1/2 s times h.Well h is this business.So it's s times this.So it's 1/2 times s times the square root of 3s over 2, whichis going to be equal to s times s is s squared.So this is going to be square root of 3s squared over 2 times 2 over 4.So this is the area of an equilateral triangleas the function of the length of its sides.So what's the area of this business going to be?So the area of our little equilateral triangle--let me write a combined area.And let me do that in a neutral color.So let me do that in white.So the combined area, I'll write itA sub c is going to be equal to the area of my triangleA sub t plus the area of my square.Well, the area of my triangle, we know what it's going to be.It's going to be square root of 3 times the lengthof a side squared divided by 4.So it's going to be square root of 3.Let me do that in that same yellow color.It's going to be-- make sure I switch colors.It's going to be square root of 3 over 4 times a side squared,times x over 3 squared.All I did is the length of a side is x over 3.We already know what the area is.It's the square root of 3 over 4 times the lengthof a side squared.And then the area of this square rightover here, the area of the squareis just going to be 100 minus x over 4 squared.So our area, our combined area-- and maybe Ican write it like this-- our combined areaas a function of where we make the cut is all of this businessright over here.And this is what we need to minimize.So we need to minimize that right over there.And I will do that in the next video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/minimizing-combined-area	khanacademy	video	:00Where we left off in the last video,we had come up with an expressionas a function of x of our combined areabased on where we make the cut.And now we just need to figure outwhere this hits a minimum value.And to do that, we just have to takethe derivative of this business, figure outwhere our derivative is either undefined or 0,and then just make sure that that is a minimum value,and then we'll be all set.So let me rewrite this.So our combined area as a function of x,let me just rewrite this so it's a little bit easierto take the derivative.So this is going to be the square root of 3 timesx squared over-- let's see, this is 4 times 9.This is x squared over 9.So this is going to be 4 times 9 is 36.And then over here in blue, this isgoing to be plus 100 minus x squared over 16.Now let's take the derivative of this.So A prime, the derivative of our combined areaas a function of x, is going to beequal to-- well, the derivative of this with respectto x is just going to be square root of 3x over 18.The derivative of this with respect to x,well, it's the derivative of something squared over 16with respect to that something.So that's going to be that something to the first powertimes 2/16, which is just over 8.And then times-- we're just doing the chain rule--times the derivative of the something with respect to x.The derivative of 100 minus x with respect to xis just negative 1, so times negative 1.So we'll multiply negative 1 right over here.And so we can rewrite all of that as-- this is goingto be equal to the square root of 3/18 x plus-- let's see,I could write this as positive x/8.So I could write this as 1/8 x, right?Because a negative 1 times a negative x is positive x/8.And then minus 100/8, which is negative 12.5-- minus 12.5.And we want to figure out an x that minimizes this area.So this derivative right over here is defined for any x.So we're not going to get our critical point by figuring outwhere the derivative is undefined.But we might get a critical pointby setting this derivative equal to 0 to figure outwhat x-values make our derivative 0.When do we have a 0 slope for our original function?And then we just have to verify that thisis going to be a minimum point if we can find an x thatmakes this thing equal to 0.So let's try to solve for x.So if we add 12.5 to both sides, weget 12.5 is equal to-- if you add the x terms,you get square root of 3/18 plus 1/8 x.To solve for x, divide both sides by this business.You get x is equal to 12.5 over square root of 3 over 18plus 1/8.And we are done.At x equals this, our derivative is equal to 0.I shouldn't say we're done yet.We don't know whether this is a minimum point.In order to figure out whether this is a minimum pointwe have to figure out whether our function is concave upwardor concave downward when x is equal to this business.And to figure that out, let's take the second derivativehere.So let me rewrite the second derivativeof all of this business.The second derivative, well, thiswas the same function as this right over here.So let me rewrite it.So A prime, the derivative of our combined area,was equal to the square root of 3/18 x plus 1/8 x minus 12.5.The second derivative is going to besquare root of 3/18 plus 1/8.So this thing right over here is greater than 0,which means we're concave upward for all x's.Concave upwards, which means for all x's.We're kind of doing a situation like this.So if we find an x where the slope is 0,it's going to be over an intervalwhere it's concave upwards.This is concave upwards for all x.So we're going to be at a minimum point.The slope is 0 right over here.This right over here will be a minimum point.So once again, this is going to be a minimum point.Now, if we actually had a 100-meter wire,this expression isn't too valuable.We'd want to get a pretty close approximationin terms of where to actually makethe cut, an actual decimal number.So let's use a calculator to get that.So we have 12.5 divided by square root of 3 dividedby 18 plus 1 divided by 8 gives us--and now we deserve our drum roll.This is 56.5.So this is approximately equal to 56.5 meters.So you make this cut roughly 56.5--I'll write roughly-- 56.5 meters from the left-hand side.And you will minimize the combined areaof both of these figures.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-solving-optimization-problems/v/extreme-derivative-word-problem-advanced	khanacademy	video	:00I just got sent this problem, and it's apretty meaty problem.A lot harder than what you'd normally findin most textbooks.So I thought it would help us all to work it out.And it's one of those problems that when you first read it,your eyes kind of glaze over, but when you understand whatthey're talking about, it's reasonably interesting.So they say, the curve in the figure above is the parabolay is equal to x squared.So this curve right there is y is equal to x squared.Let us define a normal line as a line whose first quadrantintersection with the parabola is perpendicularto the parabola.So this is the first quadrant, right here.And they're saying that a normal line is something, whenthe first quadrant intersection with the parabola isnormal to the parabola.So if I were to draw a tangent line right there, this line isnormal to that tangent line.That's all that's saying.So this is a normal line, right there.Normal line.Fair enough.5 normal lines are shown in the figure.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.Good enough.And these all look perpendicular, or normal tothe parabola in the first quadrant intersection,so that makes sense.For a while, the x-coordinate of the second quadrantintersection of the normal line of the parabola gets smaller,as the x-coordinate of the first quadrant intersectiongets smaller.So let's see what happens as the x-quadrant of the firstintersection gets smaller.So this is where I left off in that dense text.So if I start at this point right here, my x-coordinateright there would look something like this.Let me go down.my x-coordinate is right around there.And then as I move to a smaller x-coordinate to, say, this oneright here, what happened to the normal line?Or even more important, what happened to the intersectionof the normal line in the second quadrant?This is the second quadrant, right here.So when I had a larger x-value here, my normalline intersected here, in the second quadrant.Then when I brought my x-value in, when I lowered my x-value,my x-value here, because this is the next point, right here,my x-value at the intersection here, went-- actually,their wording is bad.They're saying that the second quadrantintersection gets smaller.But actually, it's not really getting smaller.It's getting less negative.I guess smaller could be just absolute value or magnitude,but it's just getting less negative.It's moving there, but it's actually becominga larger number, right?It's becoming less negative, but a larger number.But if we think in absolute value, I guess it'sgetting smaller, right?As we went from that point to that point, as we moved the xin for the intersection of the first quadrant, the secondquadrant intersection also moved in a bit, fromthat line to that line.Fair enough.But eventually, a normal line second quadrant intersectiongets as small as it can get.So if we keep lowering our x-value in the first quadrant,so we keep on pulling in the first quadrant, as weget to this point.And then this point intersects the second quadrant,right there.And then, if you go even smaller x-values in the firstquadrant then your normal line starts intersecting in thesecond quadrant, further and further negative numbers.So you can kind of view this as the highest value, or thesmallest absolute value, at which the normal line canintersect in the second quadrantLet me make that clear.Up here, you were intersecting when you had a large x in thefirst quadrant, you had a large negative x in the secondquadrant intersection.And then as you lowered your x-value, here, you had asmaller negative value.Up until you got to this point, right here, you got this, whichyou can view as the smallest negative value could get, andthen when you pulled in your x even more, these normal linesstarted to push out again, out in the second quadrant.That's, I think, what they're talking about.The extreme normal line is shown as a thickline in the figure.Right.This is the extreme normal line, right there.So this is the extreme one, that deep, bold one.Extreme normal line.After this point, when you pull in your x-values even more, theintersection in your second quadrant starts topush out some.And you can think of the extreme case, if you draw thenormal line down here, your intersection with the secondquadrant is going to be way out here someplace, although itseems like it's kind of asymptoting a little bit.But I don't know.Let's read the rest of the problem.Once the normal line passes the extreme normal line, thex-coordinates of their second quadrant intersections what theparabola start to increase.And they're really, when they say they start to increase,they're actually just becoming more negative.That wording is bad.I should change this to more, more negative.Or they're becoming larger negative numbers.Because once you get below this, then all of a suddenthe x-intersections start to push out more inthe second quadrant.Fair enough.The figures show 2 pairs of normal lines.Fair enough.The 2 normal lines of a pair have the same second quadrantintersection with the parabola, but 1 is above the extremenormal line, in the first quadrant, the otheris below it.Right, fair enough.For example, this guy right here, this is when wehad a large x-value.He intersects with the second quadrant there.Then if you lower and lower the x-value, if you lower itenough, you pass the extreme normal line, and then you getto this point, and then this point, he intersects, oractually, you go to this point.So if you pull in your x-value enough, you once againintersect at that same point in the second quadrant.So hopefully I'm making some sense to you, as I try to makesome sense of this problem.OK.Now what do they want to know?And I think I only have time for the first part of this.Maybe I'll do the second part in the another video.Find the equation of the extreme normal line.Well, that seems very daunting at first, but I think ourtoolkit of derivatives, and what we know about equationsof a line, should be able to get us there.So what's the slope of the tangent line at anypoint on this curve?Well, we just take the derivative of y equalsx squared, and y prime is just equal to 2x.This is the slope of the tangent at any point x.So if I want to know the slope of the tangent at x0, at someparticular x, I would just say, well, let me just say,slope, it would be 2 x0.Or let me just say, f of x0 is equal to 2 x0.This is the slope at any particular x0 ofthe tangent line.Now, the normal line slope is perpendicular to this.So the perpendicular line, and I won't review it here, but theperpendicular line has a negative inverse slope.So the slope of normal line at x0 will be the negative inverseof this, because this is the slope of the tangent line x0.So it'll be equal to minus 1 over 2 x0.Fair enough.Now, what is the equation of the normal line at x0 let's saythat this is my x0 in question.What is the equation of the normal line there?Well, we can just use the point-slope formof our equation.So this point right here will be on the normal line.And that's the point x0 squared.Because this the graph of y equals x0, x squared.So this normal line will also have this point.So we could say that the equation of the normal line,let me write it down, would be equal to, this is just apoint-slope definition of a line.You say, y minus the y-point, which is just x0 squared,that's that right there, is equal to the slope of thenormal line minus 1 over 2 x0 times x minus thex-point that we're at.Minus x, minus x0.This is the equation of the normal line.So let's see.And what we care about is when x0 is greater than 0, right?We care about the normal line when we're in the firstquadrant, we're in all of these values right there.So that's my equation of the normal line.And let's solve it explicitly in terms of x.So y is a function of x.Well, if I add x0 squared to both sides, I get y isequal to, actually, let me multiply this guy out.I get minus 1/2 x0 times x, and then I have plus, plus, becauseI have a minus times a minus, plus 1/2.The x0 and the over the x0, they cancel out.And then I have to add this x0 to both sides.So all I did so far, this is just this part right there.That's this right there.And then I have to add this to both sides of the equation, sothen I have plus x0 squared.So this is the equation of the normal line, in mx plus b form.This is its slope, this is the m, and then this is itsy-intercept right here.That's kind of the b.Now, what do we care about?We care about where this thing intersects.We care about where it intersects the parabola.And the parabola, that's pretty straightforward, that's justy is equal to x squared.So to figure out where they intersect, we just haveto set the 2 y's to be equal to each other.So they intersect, the x-values where they intersect, xsquared, this y would have to be equal to that y.Or we could just substitute this in for that y.So you get x squared is equal to minus 1 over 2 x0 times x,plus 1/2 plus x0 squared.Fair enough.And let's put this in a quadratic equation, or try tosolve this, so we can apply the quadratic equation.So let's put all of this stuff on the lefthand side.So you get x squared plus 1 over 2 x0 times x minusall of this, 1/2 plus x0 squared is equal to 0.All I did is, I took all of this stuff and I put it on thelefthand side of the equation.Now, this is just a standard quadratic equation, so we canfigure out now where the x-values that satisfy thisquadratic equation will tell us where our normal lineand our parabola intersect.So let's just apply the quadratic equation here.So the potential x-values, where they intersect, x isequal to minus b, I'm just applying thequadratic equation.So minus b is minus 1 over 2 x0, plus or minus thesquare root of b squared.So that's that squared.So it's one over four x0 squared minus 4ac.So minus 4 times 1 times this minus thing.So I'm going to have a minus times a minus is a plus, soit's just 4 times this, because there was one there.So plus 4 times this, right here.4 times this is just 2 plus 4 x0 squared.All I did is, this is 4ac right here.Well, minus 4ac.The minus and the minus canceled out, soyou got a plus.There's a 1.So 4 times c is just 2 plus 4x squared.I just multiply this by two, and of course all of thisshould be over 2 times a. a is just 2 there.So let's see if I can simplify this.Remember what we're doing.We're just figuring out where the normal line and theparabola intersect.Now, what do we get here.This looks like a little hairy beast here.Let me see if I can simplify this a little bit.So let us factor out-- let me rewrite this.I can just divide everything by 1/2, so this is minus 1 over 4x0, I just divided this by 2, plus or minus 1/2, that's justthis 1/2 right there, times the square root, let me see whatI can simplify out of here.So if I factor out a 4 over x0 squared, then what doesmy expression become?This term right here will become an x to the fourth, x0to the fourth, plus, now, what does this term become?This term becomes a 1/2 x0 squared.And just to verify this, multiply 4 times 1/2, youget 2, and then the x0 squares cancel out.So write this term times that, will equal 2, and then you haveplus-- now we factored a four out of this and the x0squared, so plus 1/16.Let me scroll over a little bit.And you can verify that this works out.If you were to multiply this out, you should get thisbusiness right here.I see the home stretch here, because this should actuallyfactor out quite neatly.So what does this equal?So the intersection of our normal line and ourparabola is equal to this.Minus 1 over 4 x0 plus or minus 1/2 times the squareroot of this business.And the square root, this thing right here is4 over x0 squared.Now what's this?This is actually, lucky for us, a perfect square.And I won't go into details, because then the video will gettoo long, but I think you can recognize that this isx0 squared, plus 1/4.If you don't believe me, square this thing right here.You'll get this expression right there.And luckily enough, this is a perfect square, so wecan actually take the square root of it.And so we get, the point at which they intersect,our normal line and our parabola, and this isquite a hairy problem.The points where they intersect is minus 1 over 4 x0, plusor minus 1/2 times the square root of this.The square root of this is the square root of this, which isjust 2 over x0 times the square root of this, which isx0 squared plus 1/4.And if I were to rewrite all of this, I'd get minus 1 over 4 x0plus, let's see, this 1/2 and this 2 cancel out, right?So these cancel out.So plus or minus, now I just have a one overx0 times x0 squared.So I have 1 over x0-- oh sorry, let me, we have to be verycareful there-- x0 squared divided by x0 is just x0, letme do that in a yellow color so you know what I'm dealing with.This term multiplied by this term is just x0, and thenyou have a plus 1/4 x0.And this is all a parentheses here.So these are the two points at which the normal curve andour parabola intersect.Let me just be very clear.Those 2 points are, for if this is my x0 that we'redealing with, right there.It's this point and this point.And we have a plus or minus here, so this is going to bethe plus version, and this is going to be the minus version.In fact, the plus version should simplify into x0.Let's see if that's the case.Let's see if the plus version actually simplifies to x0.So these are our two points.If I take the plus version, that should be our firstquadrant intersection.So x is equal to minus 1/4 x0 plus x0 plus 1/4 x0.And, good enough, it does actually cancel out.That cancels out.So x0 is one of the points of intersection, whichmakes complete sense.Because that's how we even defined the problem.But, so this is the first quadrant intersection.So that's the first quadrant intersection.The second quadrant intersection will bewhere we take the minus sign right there.So x, I'll just call it in the second quadrant intersection,it'd be equal to minus 1/4 x0 minus this stuff over here,minus the stuff there.So minus x0 minus 1 over 4 mine x0.Now what do we have?So let's see.We have a minus 1 over 4 x0, minus 1 over 4 x0.So this is equal to minus x0, minus x0, minus 1 over 2 x0.So if I take minus 1/4 minus 1/4, I get minus 1/2.And so my second quadrant intersection, all this workI did got me this result.My second quadrant intersection, I hope Idon't run out of space.My second quadrant intersection, of the normalline and the parabola, is minus x0 minus 1 over 2 x0.Now this by itself is a pretty neat result we just got, butwe're unfortunately not done with the problem.Because the problem wants us to find that point, the maximumpoint of intersection.They call this the extreme normal line.The extreme normal line is when our second quadrantintersection essentially achieves a maximum point.I know they call it the smallest point, but it's thesmallest negative value, so it's really a maximum point.So how do we figure out that maximum point?Well, we have our second quadrant intersection asa function of our first quadrant x.I could rewrite this as, my second quadrant intersection asa function of x0 is equal to minus x minus 1 over 2 x0.So this is going to reach a minimum or a maximum point whenits derivative is equal to 0.This is a very unconventional notation, and that'sprobably the hardest thing about this problem.But let's take this derivative with respect to x0.So my second quadrant intersection, the derivative ofthat with respect to x0, is equal to, this is prettystraightforward.It's equal to minus 1, and then I have a minus 1/2 times, thisis the same thing as x to the minus 1.So it's minus 1 times x0 to the minus 2, right?I could have rewritten this as minus 1/2 timesx0 to the minus 1.So you just put its exponent out front anddecrement it by 1.And so this is the derivative with respect to my firstquadrant intersection.So let me simplify this.So x, my second quadrant intersection, the derivative ofit with respect to my first quadrant intersection, is equalto minus 1, the minus 1/2 and the minus 1 become a positivewhen you multiply them, and so plus 1/2 over x0 squared.Now, this'll reach a maximum or minimum when it equals 0.So let's set that equal to 0, and then solve thisproblem right there.Well, we add one to both sides.We get 1 over 2 x0 squared is equal to 1, or you could justsay that that means that 2 x0 squared must be equal to1, if we just invert both sides of this equation.Or we could say that x0 squared is equal to 1/2, or if we takethe square roots of both sides of that equation, we get x0 isequal to 1 over the square root of 2.So we're really, really, really close now.We've just figured out the x0 value that gives usour extreme normal line.This value right here.Let me do it in a nice deeper color.This value right here, that gives us the extreme normalline, that over there is x0 is equal to 1 overthe square root of 2.Now, they want us to figure out the equation of theextreme normal line.Well, the equation of the extreme normal line we alreadyfigured out right here.It's this.The equation of the normal line is that thing, right there.So if we want the equation of the normal line at this extremepoint, right here, the one that creates the extreme normalline, I just substitute 1 over the square root of 2 in for x0.So what do I get?I get, and this is the home stretch, and this is quitea beast of a problem.y minus x0 squared.x0 squared is 1/2, right?1 over the square root of 2 squared is 1/2.Is equal to minus 1 over 2 x0.So let's be careful here.So minus 1/2 times 1 over x0.One over x0 is the square root of 2, right?All of that times x minus x0.So that's 1 over the square root of 2. x0 is oneover square root of 2.So let's simplify this a little bit.So the equation of our normal line, assuming I haven't madeany careless mistakes, is equal to, so y minus 1/2is equal to, let's see.If we multiply this minus square root of 2 over 2x, andthen if I multiply these square root of 2 overthis, it becomes one.And then I have a minus and a minus, so thatI have a plus 1/2.I think that's right.Yeah, plus 1/2, this times this times thatis equal to plus 1/2.And then, we're at the home stretch.So we just add 1/2 to both sides of this equation, and weget our extreme normal line equation, which is y isequal to minus square root of 2 over 2x.If you add 1/2 to both sides of this equation, you get plus 1.And there you go.That's the equation of that line there, assuming I haven'tmade any careless mistakes.But even if I have, I think you get the idea of hopefully howto do this problem, which is quite a beastly one.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-analyzing-functions/cs1-analyzing-implicit-relations/v/implicit-curve-horizontal-tangent	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We're told to considerthe curve given by the equation.They give this equation.It can be shown that the derivative of y with respect to xis equal to this expression, and you could figure that outwith just some implicit differentiationand then solving for the derivative of y with respect to x.We've done that in other videos.Write the equation of the horizontal linethat is tangent to the curve and is above the x-axis.Pause this video, and see if you can have a go at it.So let's just make sure we're visualizing this right.So let me just draw a quick and dirty diagram.If that's my y-axis, this is my x-axis.I don't know exactly what that curve looks like,but imagine you have some type of a curvethat looks something like this.Well, there would be two tangent linesthat are horizontal based on how I've drawn it.One might be right over there,so it might be like there.And then another one might be maybe right over here.And they want the equation of the horizontal linethat is tangent to the curve and is above the x-axis.So what do we know?What is true if this tangent line is horizontal?Well, that tells us that, at this point,dy/dx is equal to zero.In fact, that would be true at both of these points.And we know what dy/dx is.We know that the derivative of y with respect to xis equal to negative two times x plus threeover four y to the third power for any x and y.And so when will this equal zero?Well, it's going to equal zero when our numeratoris equal to zero and our denominator isn't.So when is our numerator going to be zero?When x is equal to negative three.So when x is equal to negative three,the derivative is equal to zero.So what is going to be the corresponding y valuewhen x is equal to negative three?And, if we know that, well, this equationis just going to be y is equal to something.It's going to be that y value.Well, to figure that out,we just take this x equals negative three,substitute it back into our original equation,and then solve for y.So let's do that.So it's going to be negative three squaredplus y to the fourthplus six times negative three is equal to seven.This is nine.This is negative 18.And so we're going to get y to the fourthminus nine is equal to seven,or, adding nine to both sides,we get y to the fourth power is equal to 16.And this would tell us that y is goingto be equal to plus or minus two.Well, there would be then two horizontal lines.One would be y is equal to two.The other is y is equal to negative two.But they want us, the equation of the horizontal linethat is tangent to the curve and is above the x-axis,so only this one is going to be above the x-axis.And we're done.It's going to be y is equal to two.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-accumulations-of-change-introduction/v/introduction-to-integral-calculus	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So I have a curve herethat represents y is equal to f of x,and there's a classic problemthat mathematicians have long thought about.How do we find the area under this curve?Maybe under the curve and above the x-axis,and let's say between two boundaries.Let's say between x is equal to a and x is equal to b.So let me draw these boundaries right over here.That's our left boundary.This is our right boundary.And we want to think about this area right over here.Well, without calculus, you could actuallyget better and better approximations for it.How would you do it?Well, you could divide this sectioninto a bunch of delta x's that go from a to b.They could be equal sections or not,but let's just say, for the sake of visualizations,I'm gonna draw roughly equal sections here.So that's the first.That's the second.This is the third.This is the fourth.This is the fifth.And then we have the sixth right over here.And so each of these, this is delta x,let's just call that delta x one.This is delta x two.This width right over here, this is delta x three,all the way to delta x n.I'll try to be general here.And so what we could do is, let's try to sum up the areaof the rectangles defined here.And we could make the height,maybe we make the heightbased on the value of the function at the right bound.It doesn't have to be.It could be the value of the functionsomeplace in this delta x.But that's one solution.We're gonna go into a lot more depth into itin future videos.And sowe do that.And so now we have an approximation, where we could say,look, the area of each of these rectanglesare going to be f of x sub i,where maybe x sub i is the right boundary,the way I've drawn it, times delta x i.That's each of these rectangles.And then we can sum them up,and that would give us an approximation for the area.But as long as we use a finite number,we might say, well, we can always get better bymaking our delta x's smallerand then by having more of these rectangles,or get to a situation here we're going fromi is equal to oneto i is equal to n.But what happens is delta xgets thinner and thinner and thinner,and n gets larger and larger and larger,as delta x gets infinitesimally smalland then as n approaches infinity.And so you're probably sensing something,that maybe we could think about the limitas we could say as n approaches infinityor the limit as delta xbecomes very, very, very, very small.And this notion of getting better and better approximationsas we take the limit as n approaches infinity,this is the core idea of integral calculus.And it's called integral calculusbecause the central operation we use,the summing up of an infinite numberof infinitesimally thin things is one way to visualize it,is the integral,that this is going to be the integral,in this case, from a to b.And we're gonna learn in a lot more depth,in this case, it is a definite integral of f of x,f of x, dx.But you can already see the parallels here.You can view the integral sign as like a sigma notation,as a summation sign, but instead of taking the sumof a discrete number of thingsyou're taking the sum of an infinitely,an infinite number, infinitely thin things.Instead of delta x, you now have dx,infinitesimally small things.And this is a notion of an integral.So this right over here is an integral.Now what makes it interesting to calculus,it is using this notion of a limit,but what makes it even more powerfulis it's connected to the notion of a derivative,which is one of these beautiful things in mathematics.As we will see in the fundamental theorem of calculus,that integration, the notion of an integral,is closely, tied closely to the notion of a derivative,in fact, the notion of an antiderivative.In differential calculus, we looked at the problem of,hey, if I have some function, I can take its derivative,and I can get the derivative of the function.Integral calculus, we're going to be doing a lot of,well, what if we start with the derivative,can we figure outthrough integration,can we figure out its antiderivativeor the function whose derivative it is?As we will see, all of these are related.The idea of the area under a curve,the idea of a limitof summing an infinite number of infinitely things,thin things, and the notion of an antiderivative,they all come together in our journey in integral calculus.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-accumulations-of-change-introduction/v/definite-integrals-intro	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're gonna do in this videois introduce ourselves to the notion of a definite integraland with indefinite integrals and derivativesthis is really one of the pillars of calculusand as we'll see, they're all relatedand we'll see that more and more in future videosand we'll also get a better appreciationfor even where the notationof a definite integral comes from.So, let me draw some functions hereand we're actually gonna start thinking aboutareas under curves.So, let me draw a coordinate axes here,so that's my Y axis, this is my X axis,actually I'm gonna do two cases.So, this is my Y axis, this is my X axisand let's say I have some function here,so this F of X right over thereand let's say that this is X equals Aand let me draw a line going straight up like thatand let's say that this is X equals B,just like thatand what we want to do is concern ourselveswith the area under the graph,under the graph of Y is equal to F of Xand above the X axis and between these two bounds,between X equals A and X equals B,so this area right over hereand you can already get an appreciation.We're not used to finding areaswhere one of the boundaries or as we'll see in the future,many of the boundaries could actually be curvesbut that's one of the powers of the definite integraland one of the powers of integral calculus.And so, the notation for this area right over herewould be the definite integraland so, we're gonna have our lower bound at X equals A,so we'll write it there,we'll have our upper bound at X equals B,right over there.We're taking the area under the curve of F of X,F of X and then DX.Now, in the future we're going to,especially once we start looking at Riemann sums,we'll get a better understandingof where this notation comes from.This actually comes from Leibniz,one of the founders of calculus.This is known as the summa symbolbut for the sake of this videoyou just need to know what this represents.This right over here,this represents the area under F of Xbetween X equals A and X equals B.So, this value and this expressionshould be the same
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-accumulations-of-change-introduction/v/area-under-rate-function-example	khanacademy	video	:01Voiceover: It took 20 minutes before Jugheadnoticed that his hot tub had sprung a leak.Once he realized it, he opened the hot tub's drainand the rest of the water rushed out in 40 minutes.The rate at which the water drained from the hot tubin gallons per minute is shown.How many gallons of water were in the hot tubbefore it started to leak?So let's see what they have over here.So they've plotted gallons per minuteversus time in minutes.So we see here, this blue line,this is the rate at which water drained from the hot tub.So at minute zero, the water wasn't really drainingfrom the hot tub and then not just more drainedbut the rate at which the water was draining increased.So 10 minutes into his bath, the water was drainingat a gallon per minute and then 20 minutes into his bathwater was draining at two gallons per minute.Then he noticed it and he opens the drain.I guess he wants to accelerate the end of his bath.So he opens the drain and then all of a suddenwater starts draining out at a much higher rate,at 20 gallons per minute, but then that decreases.So we could think about physically why that might decrease.Maybe there was just less pressure or whatever.We're not going to go into the physics of it,but we're just going to take this chart as fact.The rate at which the water drains decreasesall the way to the 60th minute,which is 40 minutes after he opened the drain.At the 60th minute, all of the waterwas actually drained out.So given that, how do we think abouthow many gallons of water were in the hot tubbefore it started to leak?And I encourage you to pause the videoand try to see if you could figure it out yourselfbefore I work through it.Well, to answer this question:How many gallons of water were in the hot tubbefore it started to leak?That is answering the same question asHow much total hot water drained out?So how much drained out?And to think about that, we can just kind of go backto what we knew before we learned about calculus.If I have something happening at a fixed rate,so let's say that this is gallons per minute.So this is still the same context, I guess you could say.This is time in minutes.Let's say things are draining out at a constant rate.If you wanted to figure out how much drains outover a certain interval of time,let's say this interval of time right over here,let's call that delta t,you would just multiply the rate over that interval of time,which we could represent bythis orange height right over here,times the amount of time that passed by,which would give you the areaunder the curve over that interval.the area under the curve over that interval.This area would tell you the gallonsthat drained over that delta t.And this doesn't just apply when you have a constant rate.If your rate looked something like this,as we've seen in other videos,you could figure out the amount that has drainedin a specific interval, let's saythis interval right over here,by essentially figuring out the area under the curveover that interval, and the units work out.If you multiply gallons per minute times minute,this area is going to be in terms of gallons.Another way you could think about it,and this goes back to, well, how do you figure outthe area of a trapezoid right over here.Well, the area of a trapezoid,you could find the average height of the trapezoid,which would be the averageof the beginning and the end period,you take that average over there,and this would work for a line like this,if you take that average heightand multiply by the change in time,you are going to figure out that area.And that is another way of thinking about it.You are taking the average rate over that intervaltimes the interval, and that is going to give youthe total number of gallons.And so we just have to apply that idea over here.We just have to literally figure outthe area under the curve over the entire intervalwhen the water was actually leaking or draining.So essentially the area under the curvebetween zero minutes and 60 minutes.And so it is going to be this area plusall of this area under this part as well.To help us think about that,I'm going to just split that up into some sections.So I'll have this triangular section up here.I could just think about this as a trapezoid,but I'm just going to split it upinto a triangle and a rectangle.And then I have this section right over here in green.So what is the area of this entire thing?Well, the area right over here,we have 20 minutes times two gallons per minute times 1/2.This gives us the area under this triangle.So that's going to be 20 gallons.We see that the units work out nicely.So that is essentially how much has drained outin the first 20 minutes.And then this green area is going to be 40 minutestimes 10 gallons per minute.And actually maybe you know the units,since I'm breaking it up in this strange way,I'll just figure out this area in a unit-less way.So 40 times 10, which is equal to 400.And then, finally, in blue, I have 40 times this heightright over here between 10 and 20 is another 10but then I'm going to multiply that times 1/2.So it's going to be 40 times 10 times 1/2,which is going to be 200.And so when you add all of these areas together,you are going to get 400 plus 200 is 600 plus 20.You are going to have 620 gallons.620 gallons is how much water in total drained outor how much water was in the tub before it started to leak,or the hot tub, yeah this is quite big for a regular tub,bu this could be like a Jacuzzi or a hot tub or something.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/simple-riemann-approximation-using-rectangles	khanacademy	video	:00What we're going to try to do in this videois approximate the area under the curve yis equal to x squared plus 1 between the intervals x equals1 and x equals 3.And we're going to approximate itby constructing four rectangles under the curve of equal width.So let's first think about what those rectangles look like, sofour rectangles of equal width.So it looks like that, like that, and like that.And I haven't really defined the top of the rectangles just yet.But let's think about what those widths haveto be if they're going to be equal width.And we can call that width delta x.So this distance right over here,we're going to call that delta x.So delta x is going to have to be the total distancethat we're traveling in x.So we finish at 3.We started at 1.And we want four equal-width rectangles.So it's going to be equal to 1/2.So for example, this first intervalbetween the boundary between the first rectangle and the secondis going to be 1.5.Then we go 1/2 to 2.Then we go to 2.5.And then we go 1/2 to 3.Now, let's think about how we'll definethe height of the rectangles.For the sake of this video-- we'll see in future videosthat there's other ways of doing this--I'm going to use the left boundary of the rectangleto define the height-- or the function, I should say.I'm going to use the function evaluated at the left boundaryto define the height.So for example, for the first rectangle,this point right over here is f of 1.And so I will say that that is the heightof our first rectangle.Then we go over here to the left boundaryof the second rectangle.We're now looking at the function evaluated at 1.5.So that is f of 1.5.That's the height.And so we get our second rectangle.Then, we get-- I can keep going like this-- we get,for this third rectangle, we havethe function evaluated at 2.So that's right over here.That's f of 2.And so then we get our third rectangle.And then, finally, we have our fourth rectangle,the function evaluated at 2.5.So the function evaluated at 2.5 is the height.So this is f of 2.5.Remember, in each of these, I'm justlooking at the left boundary of the rectangleand evaluating the function thereto get the height of the rectangle.Now that I've set it up in this way,what is the total approximate areausing the sum of these rectangles?And clearly, this isn't going to be a perfect approximation.I'm giving up on a bunch of area here.Let me see if I can color that in with a colorthat I have not used.So I'm giving up.I'm giving up this area.I'm giving up this area.I'm giving up that area.I'm giving up that area there.But this is just an approximation,and maybe if I had many more rectangles,it would be a better approximation.So let's figure out what the areas of each of the rectanglesare.So the area of this first rectangleis going to be the height, which is f of 1,times the base, which is delta x.The area of the second rectangle isgoing to be the height, which we already said was f of 1.5,times the base, times delta x.The height of the third rectangleis going to be the function evaluated at its left boundary,so f of 2-- so plus f of 2 times the base, times delta x.And then, finally, the area of the third rectangle, the heightis the function evaluated at 2.5,so plus-- that's a different colorthan what I wanted to use.I wanted to use that orange color-- soplus the function evaluated at 2.5 times the base.This is going to be equal to our approximate area--let me make it clear-- approximate areaunder the curve, just the sum of these rectangles.So let's evaluate this.So this is going to be equal to fof-- it's going to be equal to the function evaluated at 1.1 squared plus 1 is just 2, so it's going to be 2 times 1/2.Plus the function evaluated at 1.25.1.25 squared is 2.25.And then you add 1 to it, it becomes 3.25.So plus 3.25 times 1/2.And then we have the function evaluated at 2.Well, 2 squared plus 1 is 5, so it's 5 times 1/2.And then finally, you have the function evaluated at 2.5.2.5 squared is 6.25 plus 1.So that's 7.25 times 1/2.And just to make the math simpler,we can factor out the 1/2.So this is going to be equal to-- write 1/2in a neutral color-- 1/2 times 2 plus 3.25 plus 5plus 7.25, which is equal to 1/2 times-- let'ssee if I can do this in my head.2 plus 5 is easy.That's 7.3 plus 7 is 10.And then we have 0.25 plus 0.25, so it'sgoing to be 10.5 plus 7 is 17.5.So 1/2 times 17.5, which is equal to 8.75,Which, once again, gives us an approximation.And clearly, the way I've drawn it right over here,for the function we're using, it'sgoing to be an underestimate, because we've given upall that pink area that I had colored in before.It's an underestimate, but it's an approximationof the area under the curve.In the next few videos, we're goingto try to generalize this to situations wherewe have an arbitrary function and wehave an arbitrary number of rectangles.And we'll also start-- in videos after that,we'll look at rectangles where we define the height notby the left boundary, but by the right boundary,or by the midpoint.Or maybe we don't use rectangles at all.Maybe we might use things like trapezoids.Anyway, have fun.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/riemann-sums-over-and-under-estimation	khanacademy	video	:01- [Narrator] Consider the left and right Riemann sums thatwould approximate the area under y is equal to g of xbetween x equals two and x equals eight.We want to approximate this light blue area right here.Are the approximations over estimations or underestimations?So, let's just think about each of them.Let's consider the left and right Riemann sums.First the left.I'm just gonna write left for short but I'm talking aboutthe left Riemann sum.They don't tell us how many subdivisions to make forour approximation so that's up to us to decide.Let's say we went with three subdivisions.Let's say we want to make them equal.They don't have to be, but let's say we do.The first one would go from two to four,the next one would go from four to six,and the next one would go from six to eight.If we do a left Riemann sum,you use the left side of each of these subdivisionsin order to find the height.You evaluate the function at the left end of each of thosesubdivisions for the height of our approximating rectangles.We would use g of two to set the height of our firstapproximating rectangle, just like that.Then we would use g of four for the next rectangle.We would be right over there.Then you would use g of six to represent the height ofour third and our final rectangle, right over there.Now, when it's drawn out like this, it's pretty clear thatour left Riemann sum is going to be an overestimation.Why do we know that?Because these rectangles, the area that they're trying toapproximate is contained in the rectangles.And these rectangles have this surplus area so they'realways going to be larger than the areasthat they're trying to approximate.And in general,if you have a function that's decreasing over the intervalthat we care about right over here,strictly decreasing the entire time.If you use the left edge of each subdivision to approximate,you're going to have an overestimate.Because the left edge,the value of the function there,is going to be higher than the value of the function atany of the point in the subdivision.That's why for decreasing function,the left Riemann sum is going to be an overestimation.Now let's think about the right Riemann sum and you mightalready guess that's going to be the oppositebut let's visualize that.Let's just go with the same three subdivisions.But now let's use the right side of each of thesesubdivisions to define the height.For this first rectangle the height is going to be definedby g of four.That's right over there.And then for the second one it's going to be g of six.That is right over there.For the third one it's going to be g of eight.Let me shade these in to make it clear which rectangleswe're talking about.This would be the right Riemann sum to approximate the area.It's very clear herethat this is going to be an underestimate.Underestimate because we see in each of these intervals,the right Riemann sum or the rectangle that we're usingfor the right Riemann sum is a subset of the areathat its trying to estimate.We're not able to, it doesn't capture this extra arearight over there.And once again,that is because this is a strictly decreasing function.So if you use the right end point of any one of these orthe right side of any of these subdivisions in order todefine the height,that right value of g is going to be the lowest value of gin that subdivision so it's going to be a lower height thanwhat you could say is even the average height of the valueof the function over that interval.So you're going to have an underestimate in this situation.Now, if your function was strictly increasing,then these two things would be swapped around and of course,there are many functions that are neither strictlyincreasing or decreasingand then it would depend on the function.Sometimes even,it would depend on the type of subdivisions you choose todecide whether you have an overestimate or an underestimate.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/riemann-sum-from-table	khanacademy	video	:00- [Tutor] Imagine we're asked to approximate the areabetween the x-axis and the graph of ffrom x equals one to x equals 10using a right Riemann sumwith three equal subdivisions.To do that, we are given a table of values for f,so I encourage you to pause the videoand see if you can come up with an approximationfor the area between the x axis and the graphfrom x equals one to x equals 10using a right Riemann sum with three equal subdivisions,so I'm assuming you've had a go at it,so now let's try to do that togetherand this is interesting,because we don't have a graph of the entire function,but we just have the value of the functionat certain points,but as we'll see, this is all we needin order to get an approximation for the area,we don't know how close it isto the actual area with just these points,but it'll give us at leasta right Riemann sum for the approximation,or an approximation using a right Riemann sum.So let me just draw some axes here,'cause whenever I do Riemann sums,you can do 'em without graphs,but it helps to think about what's going onif you can visualize it graphically,so let's see, we are going from x equals one to x equals 10,so this is one, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10and so they give us the value of f of x when x equals one,when x equals two, three, four,when x equals seven, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10and x equals 10 and they tell us that when x is one,we're at six, then we go to eight, to three, five,so let me mark these off, so we're gonna go up to eight,so one, two, three, four, five,six, seven, eight and so what we know,when x is equal to one, f of one is six,so this is one, two, three, four, five,six, seven, eight, so this point right over hereis f of one, this is the point one comma sixand then we have the point four comma eight,four comma eight, we'll put this right about thereand then we have seven comma three is on our graph,y equals x f of x, so seven comma threewould put us right over thereand then we have 10 comma five, so 10 comma five,put this right over there.That's all we know about the function,we don't know exactly what it looks like,our function might look like this,it might do something like this,whoops, I drew a part that didn't look like a function,it might do something like thisand oscillate really quickly,it might do, it might be nice and smoothand just kind of go and do something just like that,kind of a connect the dots, we don't know,but we can still do the approximationusing a right Riemann sum with three equal subdivisions,how do we do that?Well, we're thinking about the areafrom x equals one to x equals 10,so let me make those boundaries clear,so this is from x equals one to x equals 10and what we wanna do is have three equal subdivisionsand there's three very natural subdivisions here,if we make each of our subdivisions three-wide,so this could be a subdivisionand then this is another subdivisionand when you do Riemann sums,you don't have to have three equal subdivisions,although that's what you'll often see,so we've just divided going from one to 10to three equal sections, that are three-wide,so that's three, this is three and this is threeand so the question is how do we definethe height of these subdivisions,which are going to end up being rectanglesand that's where the right Riemann sum applies,if we were doing a left Riemann sum,we would use the left boundary of each of the subdivisionsand the value of the function thereto define the height of the rectangle,so this would be doing a left Riemann sum,but we're doing a right Riemann sum,so we use the right boundary of each of thesesubdivisions to define the height,so our right boundary is when x equals fourfor this first section, what is f of four, it's eight,so we're gonna use that as the heightof our, of this first rectangle,that's approximating the area for this part of the curve.Similarly, for this second one,since we're using a right Riemann sum,we use the value of the function at the right boundary,the right boundary is seven,so the value of the function is three,so this would be our second rectangle,our second division, I guess, used to approximate the areaand then last but not least,we would use the right boundary of this third subdivisionwhen x equals 10, f of 10 is five,so just like thatand so then our right Riemann approximation,using our right Riemann sum with three equal subdivisionsto approximate the area, we would just addthe area of these rectangles, so this first rectangle,let's see, it is three wide and how high is it?Well, the height here is f of four, which is eight,so this is going to be 24 square units,whatever the units happen to be,this is going to be three times the height, here is three,f of seven is three, so that is nine square unitsand then here, this is three, the width is threetimes the height f of 10 is five,so three times five,which gets us 15and so our approximation of the areawould be summing these three values up,so this would be 24 plus, let's see,nine plus 15 would give us another 24, so it's 24 plus 24,it gets us to 48,there you go, we just using that table of values,we've been able to find an approximation.Now once again, we don't know how good our approximation is,it depends on what the function is doing,there is a world where it could be very good approximation,maybe the function does something like this,maybe the function just happens,let me make it a little bit,maybe the function does something like this,where in this case, what we just didwould be a very good approximationor maybe the function does something like this,where in this situation,this might be a very bad approximation,but we can at least do the approximationusing a right Riemann sum just using this table.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/riemann-sums-over-under-example	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The continuous function g is graphed.We're interested in the area under the curvebetween x equals negative seven and x equals seven,and we're considering using Riemann sums to approximate it.So this is the area that thinking aboutin this light blue color.Order the areas from least on top to greatest on bottom.So this is a screenshot from a Khan Academy exercisewhere you would be expectedto actually click and drag these around.But it's just a screenshot.So what I'm gonna do instead of dragging them around,I'm just gonna write numbers ordering themfrom least to greatest where one would be the leastand then three would be the greatest.So pause this video and try to think about these.Which of these is the least, which is in the middle,and which is the greatest?So let's just draw out what a left Riemann sum,a right Riemann sum would actually look like,and compare it to the actual area.And we could do an arbitrary number of subdivisions.I would encourage us to do fewerbecause we're just trying to get a general sense of things.And they don't even have to be equal subdivisions.So let's start with the left Riemann sum.So we wanna start at x equals negative seven,and we wanna go to x equals seven.Well, let's say that this isthe first rectangle right over here.So this is our first subdivision.And it's a left Riemann sum,so we would use the value of the functionat the left end of that subdivision,which is negative seven, x equals negative seven.The value of the function there is 12.And so this would be our first rectangle.You already get a sense that thisis gonna be an overestimate relative to the actual area.And so the next subdivision would start here,so this would be our height of our rectangle.And once again, they don't have to be equal subdivisions.They often are, but I'm just show you unequal subdivisionjust to show you that this is still a valid Riemann sum.And once again, this is an overestimatewhere the actual area that we're trying to approximateis smaller than the area of this rectangle.And then let's say the third subdivision right over herestarts right over there at x equals three.And we use the left end of the subdivision,the value of the function there,to define the height of the rectangle.And once again, you see it is an overestimate.So the left Riemann sum is clearly an overestimate.And it's pretty clear why.This function never increases.It's either decreasing,or it looks like it stays flat at certain points.And so for a function like that, the left edge,the value of the function at the left edgeis going to be just as high or higherthan any other value the function takes onover that interval for the subdivision.And so you get left with all of this extra areathat is part of the overestimate.Or this area that is larger than the actual areathat you're trying to approximate.Now let's think about a right Riemann sum.And I'll do different subdivisions.Let's say the first subdivision goesfrom negative seven to negative five.And here we would use the right edge to define the height.So f of negative five, or g of negative five, I should say.So that's right over there.That's our first rectangle.Maybe our next rectangle, the right edge is zero.So this would be it right over there.And then maybe we'll do four rectangles.Maybe our third subdivision,the right edge is at x is equal to three.So it would be right over there.And then our fourth subdivision,let's just do it x equals seven.And we're using the right edge of the subdivisions.Remember, this is a right Riemann sum,so we use the right edge.The value of the function there is just like that.And now you can see for any one of these subdivisions,our rectangles are under estimatesof the area under the curve.Under, underestimate.And that's because once again, in this particular case,the function never increases.It's either decreasing or staying flat.So if you use the value of the function at the right edge,it's going to be smaller,it's never going to be large than the valuethat the function takes on in the rest of that subdivision.And so we are continuously underestimating.We're missing this.All of this area right over there is not being included.So we have an underestimate.So if wanna rank these from least to greatest,well, the right Riemann sum is the least.It is underestimating it.Then you have the actual area of the curve,which is just the area of the curve. (laughs)And then you have the left Riemann sum,which is the overestimate.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/midpoint-sums	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we wanna do in this videois get an understanding of how we can approximatethe area under a curve.And for the sake of an example,we'll use the curve y is equal to x squared plus one.And let's think about the area under this curve,above the x-axis,from x equals negative one to x equals two.So that would bethis area right over here.And there's many ways that I could tackle this,but what I'm going to do isI'm gonna break up this intervalinto three equal sectionsthat are really the bases of rectangles.And then we're gonna think about the different waysto define the heights of those rectangles.So once again,I'm going to approximate using three rectanglesof equalwidth.And then we'll think about the different waysthat we can define the heights of the rectangles.So let's first define the heightsof each rectangle bythe value of the function at the midpoint.So we see that right over here.So let's just make surethat it actually makes sense to us.So if we look at our first rectangle right over here,actually let's just first appreciate,we have split up this x,we have split up the interval from x equals negative oneto x equals two into three equal sections,and then each of them have a width of one.If we wanted a better approximationwe could do more sections or more rectangles,but let's just see how we would compute this.Well the width of each of these is one,the height is based on the value of the functionat the midpoint.The midpoint here is negative 1/2,the midpoint here is 1/2,the midpoint here is 3/2.And so this height is going to be negative 1/2 squaredplus one.So negative 1/2 squared is 1/4 plus one,so that's 5/4.So the height here is 5/4.So you take 5/4 times one.This area is 5/4, let me write that down.So if we're doing the midpointto define the height of each rectangle,this first one hasan area of 5/4.Do it in a color you can see, five over four.The second one, same idea,1/2 squared plus one is 5/4times a width of one.So 5/4 there.So let me add that.Plus 5/4.And then this third rectangle,what's its height?Well we're gonna take the height at the midpoint,so 3/2 squared is9/4 plus one,which is the same thing as 13/4.So it has a height of 13/4,and then a width of one, so times one,which would just give us 13/4.So plus 13/4,which would give us 23 over fourwhich is the same thing as 5 3/4.And so this is often known as a midpoint approximationwhere we're using the midpoint of each intervalto define the height of our rectangle.But this isn't the only way to do it.We could look at the left endpointor the right endpoint,and we do that in other videos.And if we wanna do it just for kicks here,let's just do that really fast.So if we wanna look at the left endpointsof our interval,well here ourleft endpoint is negative one,negative one squared plus one is two,two times onegives us two.And then here the left part of this intervalis x equals zero,zero squared plus one is one,one times one is one.And now here our left endpoint is one,one squared plus oneis equal to two, times one,our base, is equal to two.So here we have a situationwhere we take our left endpoints,where it is equal to two plus oneplus two or five.Well we can also look at the right endpointsof our intervals.So this first rectangle here,clearly under approximating the areaover this first interval.Its right endpoint is zero,zero squared plus one is one,so a height of one, width of one, has an area of one.Second rectangle here,it has a height of, look at our right endpoint,one squared plus one is two,times our width of one, well that's just gonna give us two.And then here our right endpoint is two,squared plus one is five, times our width of one,gives us five.So in this case we get,when we look at our right endpoints of our intervals,we get oneplus two plus fiveis equal to eight.And eyeballing this,it looks like we're definitely over countingmore than under counting,and so this looks like an over approximation.So the whole idea here's just to appreciatehow we can compute these approximationsusing rectangles.And as you can imagine,if we added more rectangles that had skinnierand skinnier bases but still covered the intervalfrom x equals negative one to x equals two,we would get better and better approximationsof the true area.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-approximation-with-riemann-sums/v/trapezoidal-approximation-of-area-under-curve	khanacademy	video	:00For fun, let's try to approximate the areaunder the curve y is equal to the square root,the principal root, of x minus 1, between x is equal to 1and x is equal to 6.So I want to find this entire area.Or I want to at least approximate this entire area.And the way I'll do it is by setting upfive trapezoids of equal width.So this will be the left boundaryof the first trapezoid.This will be its right boundary, which will alsobe the left boundary of the second trapezoid.This will be the right boundary of the second trapezoid.This is the right boundary of the third trapezoid.This'll be the right boundary of the fourth trapezoid.And then finally, this will be the right boundaryof the fifth trapezoid.And since we're going from 1 to 6, so we're traveling 6 minus 1in the x direction, and I want to split it into five sections,the width of each trapezoid is just going to be equal to 1.And so if we say that the width of a trapezoid is delta x,we just can now say the delta x is equal to 1.So let's set up our trapezoids.So the first trapezoid is going to look like that.It's going to go like that.Actually, it's going to be a triangle, not reallya trapezoid.Then the second trapezoid is going to look like this.I guess you could say a trapezoid whereone of the sides has length 0 turns into a triangle.And then the third trapezoid is going to look like this.And then the fourth trapezoid is going to look like that.And then finally, you have the fifth trapezoid.So let's calculate the area of each of these,and then we will have our approximation for the areaunder the curve.So let's do trapezoid-- or I really should saytriangle-- this first shape, whatever you want to call it.What is the area of that going to be?Well, the area of a trapezoid-- and you'llsee this will just turn into the area of a triangle-- it'sthe average of the heights of the twosides of the trapezoid, the way we've looked at it--or you could say the average of the heights of the twoparallel sides, I guess is the best way to say it.So f of 1-- that's the height here-- plus f of 2,all of that over 2, and then we'regoing to multiply it times our delta x.Actually, let me do that in that same red colorto show you that this is the area of that first trapezoid,so times delta x.And as you see right over here, if you look at it, the f of 1is just going to be 0.So you're going to have f of 2 times--so it's going to be this height times this base times 1/2,which is just the area of a triangle.Let's look at the second trapezoid,trapezoid two right over here.What is its area going to be?Well, it's going to be f of 2 plus f of 3.f of 2 is this height.f of 3 is this height.So we're taking the average of those two heights-- dividedby 2; that's the average of those twoheights-- times the base, times delta x.And then let's do trapezoid three.I think you're getting the idea here.Trapezoid three is going to be f of 3plus f of 4 divided by 2 times delta x.And then-- let's see.I'm running out of colors.This is trapezoid four right over here.So plus f of 4 plus f of 5, all of that over 2, times delta x.And then we have our last trapezoid,which I will do in yellow.So this is trapezoid number five.I'll scroll down a little bit, get some more real estate.So it's going to be plus-- I'll just write the plus over here--plus f of 5 plus f of 6 over 2 times our delta x.So let's see how we can simplify this a little bit.All of these terms, we have a 1/2 delta x,so let's actually factor that out.So remember, this is our approximation of our area.So area is approximately-- remember,this is just a rough approximation.It's very clear-- actually, you might say,this is pretty good using the trapezoids,but it is pretty clear that we areletting go of some of the area.We're letting go of that area.We're letting go of some of this right over here.You can barely see it.Some of this right over here, you can barely see it.But we are-- this is going to be, it looks like,an underestimate, but it is a decent approximation.But let's see if we can simplify this expression.So it's approximately going to be equal to,I'm going to factor out a delta x over 2.And then what I'm left with-- and Iwill switch to a neutral color-- if I factor outa delta x over 2, then I have just an f of 1.And then I have two f of 2's, so plus 2 times f of 2.And I'm doing this because you might see a formula thatlooks something like this in your calculus book,and it's not some mysterious thing.They just really summed up the areas of the trapezoids.And then we're going to have two f of 3's-- plus 2 times fof 3's.Plus we're going to have two f of 4's-- plus 2 times f of 4.And then we're going to have two f of 5's-- plus 2 times f of 5.And then finally, we're going to have one f of 6-- plus f of 6.If you were to generalize it, youhave one of the first endpoint, the functionevaluated at the first endpoint, one of it at the verylast endpoint, and then two of all of the rest of them.But this is just the area of trapezoids.I'm not actually a big fan of when textbooks write this.Because when you see this, it's hard to visualizethe trapezoids.When you see this, it's much clearerhow you might visualize that.But with that out of the way, let's actually evaluate this.Lucky for us, the math is simple.Our delta x is just 1.And then we just have to evaluate all of this business.f of 1, let's just remind ourselveswhat our original function was.Our original function was the square root of x minus 1.So f of 1 is the square root of 1 minus 1,so that is just going to be 0.This expression right over here isgoing to be 2 times the square root of 2 minus 1.The square root of 2 minus 1 is just 1,so this is just going to be 2.Actually, let me do it in that same-- well,I'm now using the purple for a different purposethan just the first trapezoid.Hopefully, you realized that.I was just sticking with that pen color.Then f of 3.3 minus 1 is 2-- square root of 2.So the function evaluated at 3 is the square root of 2.So this is going to be 2 times the square root of 2.Then the function evaluated at 4.When you evaluate it at 4, you get the square root of 3.So this is going to be 2 times the square root of 3.And then you get 2 times the square root of 4-- 5 minus 1is 4.2 times the square root of 4 is just four.And then finally, you get f of 6 is square root of 6 minus 1,is the square root of 5.And I think we're now ready to evaluate.So let me get my handy TI-85 out and calculate this.So it's going to be-- well I'm justgoing to calculate-- well, I'll just multiply.So 0.5 times open parentheses-- well, it's a 0.I'll just write it, just so you know what I'm doing.0 plus 2 plus-- whoops.Lost my calculator.Plus 2 times the square root of 2 plus 2 times the square rootof 3 plus 4-- I'm almost done-- plus the square root of 5--so let me write that-- gives me--now we are ready for our drum roll-- it gives me--and I'll just round it-- 7.26.So the area is approximately equal to 7.26under the curve y is equal to the square root of xminus 1 between x equals 1 and x equals 6.And we did this using trapezoids.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-summation-notation-review/v/sigma-notation-sum	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video is introduce youto the idea of Sigma notation, which will be used extensivelythrough your mathematical career.So let's just say you wanted to find a sum of some terms,and these terms have a pattern.So let's say you want to find the sum of the first 10numbers.So you could say 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus,and you go all the way to plus 9 plus 10.And I clearly could have even written this whole thing out,but you can imagine it becomes a lot harder if you wantedto find the sum of the first 100 numbers.So that would be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus,and you would go all the way to 99 plus 100.So mathematicians said, well, let's find some notation,instead of having to do this dot dot dot thing-- whichyou will see sometimes done-- so that we can morecleanly express these types of sums.And that's where Sigma notation comes from.So this sum up here, right over here, this first one,it could be represented as Sigma.Use a capital Sigma, this Greek letter right over here.And what you do is you define an index.And you could start your index at some value.So let's say your index starts at 1.I'll just use i for index.So let's say that i starts at 1, and I'm going to go to 10.So i starts at 1, and it goes to 10.And I'm going to sum up the i's.So how does this translate into this right over here?Well, what you do is you start wherever the index is.If the index is at 1, set i equal to 1.Write the 1 down, and then you increment the index.And so i will then be equal to 2.i is 2.Put the 2 down.And you're summing each of these terms as you go.And you go all the way until i is equal to 10.So given what I just told you, I encourageyou to pause this video and write the Sigma notationfor this sum right over here.Assuming you've given a go at it,well, this would be the sum.The first term, well, it might beeasy to just say we'll start at i equals 1 again.But now we're not going to stop until i equals 100,and we're going to sum up all of the i's.Let's do another example.Let's imagine the sum from i equals 0 to 50 of-- Idon't know, let me say-- pi i squared.What would this sum look like?And once again, I encourage you to pause the videoand write it out, expand out this sum.Well, let's just go step by step.When i equals 0, this will be pi times 0 squared.And that's clearly 0, but I'll write it out.pi times 0 squared.Then we increase our i.And, well, we make sure that we haven't hit this,that our i isn't already this top boundaryright over here or this top value.So now we said i equals 1, pi times 1squared-- so plus pi times 1 squared.Well, is 1 our top value right over here, where we stop?No.So we keep going.So then we go i equals 2, pi times 2squared-- so plus pi times 2 squared.I think you see the pattern here.And we're just going to keep going all the wayuntil, at some point-- we're going to keeping incrementingour i. i is going to be 49.So it's going to be pi times 49 squared.And then finally we increment i. i equal becomes 50,and so we're going to have plus pi times 50 squared.And then we say, OK, our i is finallyequal to this top boundary, and now we can stop.And so you can see this notation,this Sigma notation for this sum was a much cleaner way,a much purer way, of representing thisthan having to write out the entire sum.But you'll see people switch back and forth between the two.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-summation-notation-review/v/summation-notation-worked-examples	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We're told consider the sumtwo plus five plus eight plus 11.Which expression is equal to the sum above?And they tell us choose all answers that apply.So like always, pause the video,and see if you can work through this on your own.So when you look at the sum,it's clear you're starting at two.You're adding three each time.And we also are dealing withyou have four total terms.Now we could try to construct an equation hereor an expression using sigma notation.But instead, what I like to do, is look at our options.We really only have to look at these two options hereand expand them out.What sum would each of these be?Well, this is going to be the same thingas we're starting at n equals one.So this is going to be three times, when n equals one,three times one minus one.And then plus, then we'll go to n equals two.Three times two minus one.Then we're gonna go to n equals three.So plus three times three minus one.And then finally, we're gonna go to n equals four.So plus three times, when n equals four,this is three times four minus one.So just to be clear, this is what we did when n equals one.Let me write it down.N equals one.This is what we got when n equals two.This is what we got when n equals three.And this is what we got when n is equal to four.And we stopped at n equals four'cause it tells us right over there,we start at n equals oneand we go all of the way to n equals four.So what does this equal?So let's see, three times one minus one is two.So this is looking good so far.Three times two minus one,that's six minus one.That is five.So still looking good.Three times three minus one, that's nine minus one.Once again, still looking good.Three times four minus one,that is 11.So we like this choice,so I would definitely select this one.Now let's do the same thing over here.When n is equal to zero,it's going to be two plus three times zero.So that's just going to be two.And then plus, when n is equal to one,it's going to be two plus three times one,which is five.This is starting to look good.Now when n is equal to, this was n equals zero,this was n equals one,so now we're at n equals two.So at n equals two,two plus three times twois two plus six, which is eight.And this makes sense.Every time we increase n by one,we are adding another three,which is consistent with what we saw there.We start at two, when n equals zero,this is just, that three n is just zero.So you start at two, and then you keep,every time you increase n by one,you are just adding three again.So finally, when n is equal to three,two plus three times three is two plus,or is11, I should say.And so this also is exactly the same sum.So I feel good about both of these.Let's do one more example.So we're here, we're given the sum,and we're saying choose one answer.Which of these is equivalent to this sum right over here?Well, like we did before, let's just expand it out.And what's different here is that we just have a variable,but that shouldn't make it too much more difficult.So let's do the situation, and I'll write it out.Let's do the situation when n is equal to one.When n is equal to one, it's gonna be k over one plus one.K over one plus one, and I'll write it out.This is n is equal to one.And then plus, when n is equal to two,it's gonna be kover two plus one.This is n is equal to two.And then we're gonna keep going.When n is equal to three,it's gonna be kover three plus one.That's n is equal to three.And then plus, finally,'cause we stop right over here at n equals four,when n equals four, it's going to be k over four plus one.That's when n is equal to four.So this is all going to be equal,I'll just write it over here,this is equal to k over two,plus k over three,plus k over four,plus k over five,which is exactly this choice right over,right over here.And actually, if I had looked at the choices ahead of time,I might have even been able to save even more timeby just saying, well, look,actually, if you just try to compute the first term,when n is equal to one, it would be k over two.Well, only this one is starting with a k over two.This, this one has no k's here, which is sketchy.They're trying to look at the errorwhere you try to replace the k with the number as well,not just the n.So that's what they're trying to do here.Here they're trying to, let's see,well, this isn't as obvious what they're even trying to do,right over here where they put the k in the denominator.And here if you swapped the n and the k's,then you would've gotten this thing right over here.So we definitely feel good about choice A.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-riemann-sums-in-summation-notation/v/generalizing-a-left-riemann-sum-with-equally-spaced-rectangles	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we attempted to approximate the areaunder a curve by constructing four rectangles of equal widthand using the left boundary of each rectangle, the functionevaluated at the left boundary, to determine the height,and we came up with an approximation.What I want to do in this video is generalize things a bitusing the exact same method, but doing itfor an arbitrary function with arbitrary boundariesand an arbitrary number of rectangles.So let's do it.So I'm going to draw the diagram as large as Ican to make things as clear as possible.So that's my y-axis.And this right over here is my x-axis.Let me draw an arbitrary function.So let's say my function looks something like that.So that is y is equal to f of x.And let me define my boundaries.So let's say this right over here is x equals a.And this right over here is x equals b.So this is b.And I'm going to use n rectangles,and I'm going to use the function evaluatedat the left boundary of the rectangleto determine its height.So, for example, this will be rectangle one.I'm going to evaluate what f of a is.So this right over here is f of a.And then I'm going to use that as the heightof my first rectangle.So just like that.So rectangle number one looks like this.And I'll even number it.Rectangle one looks just like that.And just to have a convention here,because I'm going to want to label each of the x valuesat the left boundary, so we'll say a is equal to x0.a is equal to x0.So we could also call this point right over here x0,that x value.And then we go to the next rectangle.And we could call this one right over here, this x value,we'll call it x1.It's the left boundary of the next rectangle.If we evaluate f of x1, we get this value right over here.This right over here is f of x1, so it tells us our height.And we want an equal width to the previous one.We'll think about what the width is going to be in a second.So this right over here is our second rectanglethat we're going to use to approximate the areaunder the curve.That's rectangle number two.Let's do rectangle number three.Well, rectangle number three, the left boundary,we're just going to call that x sub 2.And its height is going to be f of x sub 2.And its width is going to be the same width as the other ones.I'm just eyeballing it right over here.So this is rectangle number three.And we're going to continue this process all the wayuntil we get to rectangle number n.So this is the n-th rectangle rightover here, the n-th rectangle.And what am I going to label this point right over here?Well, we already see a pattern.The left boundary of the first rectangle is x sub 0.The left boundary of the second rectangle is x sub 1.The left boundary of the third rectangle is x sub 2.So the left boundary of the n-th rectangleis going to be x sub n minus 1.Whatever the rectangle number is,the left boundary is x sub that number minus 1.And this is just based on the convention that we've defined.Now, the next thing that we need to do in orderto actually calculate this area is think aboutwhat is the width?So let's call the width of any of these rectangles--and for these purposes, or the purpose of this example,I'm going to assume that it's constant,although you can do these sums where you actuallyvary the width of the rectangle.But then it gets a little bit fancier.So I want it equal width.So I want delta x to be equal width.And to think about what that has to be,we just have to think, what's the total width that we'recovering?Well, the total distance here is going to be b minus a,and we're just going to divide by the number of rectanglesthat we want, the number of sections that we want.So we want to divide by n.So if we assume this is true, and then weassume that a is equal to x0, and thenx1 is equal to x0 plus delta x, x2 is equal to x1 plus delta x,and we go all the way to xn is equal to xn minus 1 plus deltax, then we've essentially set up this diagram right over here.b is actually going to be equal xn.So this is xn.It's equal to xn minus 1 plus delta x.So now I think we've set up all of the notation and allthe conventions in order to actually calculatethe area, or our approximation of the area.So our approximation, approximate area,is going to be equal to what?Well, it's going to be the area of the first rectangle--so let me write this down.So it's going to be rectangle one-- so the area of rectangleone-- so rectangle one plus the area of rectangle twoplus the area of rectangle three-- I think you getthe point here-- plus all the way to the area of rectangle n.And so what are these going to be?Rectangle one is going to be its height, which is f of x0or f of a.Either way. x0 and a are the same thing.So it's f of a times our delta x,times our width, our height times our width.So times delta-- actually I can write as f of x0,I wanted to write-- f of x0 times delta x.What is our height of rectangle two?It's f of x1 times delta x.What's our area of rectangle three?It's f of x2 times delta x.And then we go all the way to our area.We're taking all the sums, all the way to rectangle n.What's its area?It's f of x sub n minus 1.Actually, that's a different shade of orange.I'll use that same shade.It is f of x sub n minus 1 times delta x.And we're done.We've written it in a very general way.But to really make us comfortablewith the various forms of notation,especially the types of notation youmight see when people are talking about approximatingthe areas or sums in general, I'mgoing to use the traditional sigma notation.So another way we could write this, as the sum,this is equal to the sum from-- and remember,this is just based on the conventions that I set up.I'll let i count which rectangle we're in, from i equals 1 to n.And then we're going to look at each rectangle.So the first rectangle, that's rectangle one.So it's going to be f of-- well, if we're in the i-th rectangle,then the left boundary is going to bex sub i minus 1 times delta x.And so here, right over here, is a general wayof thinking about approximating the area under a curve usingrectangles, where the height of the rectanglesare defined by the left boundary.And this tells us it's the left boundary.And we see for each, if this is the i-th rectangle rightover here, if this is rectangle i, then this right over hereis x sub i minus 1, and this height right over hereis f of x sub i minus 1.So that's all we did right over there times delta x.And then you sum of these from the first rectangleall the way to the end.So hopefully that makes you a little bit more comfortablewith this notation.We're not doing anything differentthan we did in this first video, which was hopefullyfairly straightforward for you.We have just generalized it using a little bit more mathynotation.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-riemann-sums-in-summation-notation/v/practice-approximating-area-under-curve	khanacademy	video	:00Voiceover: What I want to do in this video,is get a little bit of practice trying to approximatethe area under curves, and also get a little bitmore familiarity with the sigma notation in this context.So what we have here, we have the graph off of x is equal to one plus 0.1 x squared,that's this curve right over here,and then we have these rectangles that aretrying to approximate the area under the curve,the area under the function f, between x equals zero,and x equals 8, and the way that this diagram,or the way that we are attempting to do it,is by splitting it into four rectangles,and so we can call this rectangle one,this is rectangle two, rectangle three, and rectangle four.And each of their heights, let's see the interval,it looks like they each have a width of two,so they are equally spaced, so we go from zero to eight,and we split into four sections, so each has a width of two,so they're each going to be two wide,so that's two, that's two, that's two, that's two.And their height seems to be based on the midpoint,so between the start, between the left sideand the right side of the rectangle,you take the value of the function at the middle value,right over here, so for example,this height right over here looks like f of 1,this height right over here looks like f of 3,this height of this rectangle is f of 5,this height right over here is f of 7.So given the way that this has been constructed,and we want to take the sum of the areasof these rectangles as an approximation as the areaunder this curve, how would we write that as sigma notation?And I'll get us started, and then I encourage youto pause the video and try to finish it.So the sum of these rectangles,we could say it's the sum of, so we'll haven equals one to four, 'cause we have four rectangles.And I encourage you to finish this up.Actually, just write it in terms of the function,use function notation, you don't have to write it outas one plus .01 times something squared.So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.So for each of these, so for the first rectangle over here,We're gonna multiply two times the height,so the height right over here is one, and this isthe first rectangle, so you might be tempted to saytimes f of n, but then that breaks downas we go into the second rectangle.The second rectangle, the two still applies.This two is the width of the rectangle,but now we want to multiply it times f of three,not f of two, so this f of n isn't going to pass muster.And so let's see how we want to think about it.So when n is one, two, three, four, we're gonna take f of...So f of n, I shouldn't say f of n, we're gonna takef of something, so here this first one, we're gonna takef of one, then here, for the second rectangle,we're taking f of three for the height,for the third rectangle we're taking f of five,and then for the fourth rectangle, we're taking f of seven.So what's the relationship over here?Let's see, it looks like if you multiply by twoand subtract one, so two times one minus one is one,two times two minus one is three,two times three minus one is five,two times four minus one is seven.So this is two n minus one, so the area ofeach of these rectangles, the base is two,and the height is f of two and minus one.So that hopefully makes it a little bit clear,kind of mapping between the sigma notationand what we're actually trying to do.And now let's just for fun,let's actually try to evaluate this thing.What is this thing going to evaluate to?Well, this is going to evaluate to two times f of,when n is equal to one this is one, f of 1,plus two times, when n is two, this is gonna bef of, two times two minus one is three, f of 3,when n is three, this is gonna be two times f of 5,when n is four, this is going to be two times f of seven,four times two minus one is seven, f of seven.And so that is going to be, well we're gonna have toevaluate a bunch of these things over here,so let me actually, let me clear this outso I have a little bit more real estate.I'm feeling this might get a little bit messy now.So this is going to be, actually we could factor out a two.So this is going to be equal to two times f of oneis one plus 0.1 times one squared.So it's one plus 0.1, let me color-code it a little bitso we can keep track of things.So this right over here is 1.1, so one plus 0.1 is 1.1,this right over here, f of 3, so that's one plus .1times three squared, nine, so one plus .9, so it's 1.9.And then, let's see, this one right over here, f of 5,is gonna be one plus, see five squared is 25,times .1 is 2.5, so one plus 2.5 is gonna be 3.5.And then finally, f of seven, is going to beone plus .1 times seven squared,so this is 49 times .1 is 4.9 plus one, so plus 5.9.And so what is this going to be equal to?So let's see, 1.1 plus 1.9, these twoare going to sum up to be equal to three,and then these two are going to sum up to be,let's see, if we add the five, we get to 8.5,and then we add the .9, we get to 9.4, so plus 9.4.Did I do that right - three plus five is eight,.5 plus .9 is 1.4, yep, and so this is going to be,so once again, we have the two times it all,so this is going to be equal to two times 12.4,which is equal to 24.8, which is our approximation.Once again, this is just an approximationusing these rectangles of the area under the curvebetween x equals zero, and x equals eight.

been approximating the areaunder the curve using rectangles, wherethe height of each rectangle was definedby the function evaluated at the left boundary.So this would have been the first rectangle.Then the second rectangle would look something like this.And then we'd go all the way to the nth rectanglewould look something like that.And we saw-- so this is the first rectangle,this is the second rectangle, and we'dgo all the way to the nth rectangle--and so we saw that the way that you would take the sum of allof these rectangles in order to approximate the area isthat you would get the sum from i equals 1 to n.And so i is essentially a count of which rectanglewe're dealing with.And what we're going to do is multiplythe height times the base.So the height of each rectangle, the height of rectangle one,in this case, was the function evaluated at x0.The height of rectangle two was the function evaluated at x1.The height of rectangle n was the functionevaluated at x sub n minus 1.So the height of a rectangle i isgoing to be the function evaluated x sub i minus 1.If i is 2, then we're evaluating it at x1.If i was 2, then this would be the function evaluated at x1.So it's the left boundary.And then we have to multiply it times the width.And in the last few videos, and in this video,we will assume that all of the rectangles have equal width.Now, we'll call that equal width delta x.And to find it, we just have to take the total distancethat we're going in the x direction.So it's going to be b minus a dividedby the number of rectangles we want.So it's going to be times delta x.Now, you might imagine that this is not the only wayto take the sum using rectangles,or this is not the only way to take the sumor approximate the area using some type of geometric shape.For example, we could have created rectangleswhere the height is defined by the rightmost boundary.So let's define that.So here's our first rectangle.And we're defining the height by the right boundaryof the rectangle.So this right over here is rectangle one,and its height is f of x1.And then for this one right over here,we take the right boundary.The right boundary defines that height.If we go all the way to the-- thisis rectangle two-- if we go all way to the nth one,we use the right boundary to definethe height of the rectangle.So in this case-- this is the nth rectangle--how would we write this sum?Well, it would be the sum-- whichis, remember, we're just trying to approximate the areaunder the curve-- from i is equal to 1 to n.So i is a count of each of the rectangles.And so the height of the first rectangle is f of x1.The height of the nth rectangle is f of x sub n.So this height right over here is f of x sub n.So the height of the i-th rectangleis going to be f of x sub i.Whatever the rectangle number is,we take the x sub that same numberand evaluate the function there.That gives us the height.And we multiply that times delta x.So the difference between this and this here,for the i-th rectangle, we use x subi minus 1, so the left boundary.Here we use the right boundary, f of x sub i.Well, we don't have to stop there.Instead, we could use maybe the midpoint between the twoboundaries instead.So, for example, over here we couldwe could use the midpoint between x0 and x1to find the height of the rectangle.So this is right over here.This is f of x0 plus x1 over 2, justthe midpoint between these two points,to define the height of the rectangle.So it would look something like that.And the next one, we would look at the midpointto define the height.And we go all the way to the nth one,and we define the midpoint between its twosides of the rectangle.So the function evaluated there tells ushow high our rectangle should be.And it would look something like that.And so what would this sum look like?Well, once again, we would count each of our rectangles,so i equals 1 to i equals n. i iswhich rectangle we're working on.So this is the first one, this is the second one,and this is the nth one.And the height isn't just going to be f evaluatedx sub i minus 1 or f evaluated x sub i.It'll be the function evaluated at the midpointbetween the two-- x sub i minus 1 plus x sub i,all of that over two, and then times delta x.The delta x's are the same in every one of these scenarios.Now finally, let's try to break out of approximating onlywith rectangles and get a little bit more creative.Why don't we try to approximate with trapezoids?So let's try to do that.So what we could have here is the left part of the trapezoid.The height is f of x sub 0.So this is f of x sub 0.And then the right side of the trapezoid is f of x sub 1.And then what would be the-- here, and let medo that for all of them.So that would be the first trapezoid.Then the second trapezoid would look like this.This one looks almost like a rectangle,but we assume that the top isn't completely flat.And then we go all the way to the nth one.And this should be clear that we're dealing with a trapezoid.All the way to the nth one will look something like that.So how would we calculate this area,the area of the trapezoid?Well, you just have to remember that the area of a trapezoidis just the average of the heights of the twosides times the base.So in this case-- and let me write it out a little bit.So the area right over there is goingto be the average of the heights.So it's going to be f of x sub 0 plus f of x sub 1,all of that over 2.And then we're going to multiply that times delta x.So that would be the area just of this one right over here.We took the average of the two heightsand multiplied that times the base.Now, if we wanted the sum of the areas of all these trapezoids,and we wanted to write in general terms,we could just write it's the sum-- once again,we're going to count the trapezoids.So this is the first trapezoid, this is the second,all the way to the nth trapezoid.So it's i equals 1 to i equals n.And the height of each trapezoid,we're going to use the function evaluated at the left boundary,x sub i minus 1, the average of the function evaluatedat the left boundary and the functionevaluated at the right boundary, and we'regoing to take the average of thatand then multiply that times the base.So the whole reason why I wanted to dothis is to show you there's multiple, multiple waysof doing this.And in fact, if you wanted to get really general,you could even have different widths.But then that gets a little bit more confusing.But really, just to show you that youmight see some of this fancy notation in your calculus bookor in your precalculus book.But all it's doing is summing up the areas of trapezoidsand rectangles depending on whether they'reusing the right boundaries of the rectangleto define the height, the left boundaries, the midpointof the left and the right boundaries,or they could even construct trapezoids.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-riemann-sums-in-summation-notation/v/riemann-sum-negative-function	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] The graph of F is shown below.A total of 24 right hand rectanglesare shown.So, what do I mean by right hand rectangles?So, there's clearly 24 rectangles.You can count them.And right hand rectangle means thatfor each of these rectangles the heightof the rectangle is defined by the valueof the function on the right hand sideof the rectangle.So you can see this is the right hand sideof this first rectangle and if you takethe value of the function of that pointthat is the height of the rectangle.A left hand rectangle would definethe height of the rectangle by the valueof the function on the left hand sideof the rectangle.So, a left handed rectangle's height,the first rectangle's height would looklike that.That's what they mean by righthanded rectangleFair enough, eight in blue.We see that. 16 in red. All right.All 24 of the rectangles have the same width.Which of the statements belowis or are true?They give us three expressionsin sigma notation and they say,like this first one is the sum of theareas of the blue rectangles.This is the sum of the areas ofthe red rectangles.This is the sum of the areas of allof the rectangles.So, I encourage you now to pausethe video and try to determine on your own,which of the statements is or are true.So, I assume you've had a go at it.Let's just go through each of theseand see whether they make sense.So this first one, the sumof the areas of the blue rectangles.Well, we know we have one, two, three,four, five, six, seven, eight blue rectangles,and we're summing from one to eight.So it seems like we're summing eightthings right over here.This is one, two, three, four, five,six, seven, eight.So, this is looking good right over here.And then we take F of somethingtimes one half.So, we're not even looking at this yet.It looks like this would be the heightof each of the rectangles.Remember, we're taking the valueof the function on the right hand sidefor the height, and this would bethe width.So does it make sense that the widthof each of these rectangles is one half?Well, the total distance between Xequals negative five and X equals seven,that distance is 12.Five plus seven, that's 12,and we're dividing it into 24 rectanglesof equal width.So, if you divide 12 divided by 24each of these are going to have a widthof one half.So this is checking out that the one half.Now let's think about this part.Let's think about the F of negative fiveplus I over two.So, let's see.When I is equal to one, so we're going totake one half times F of negative fiveplus one over two.Right?I is one. So negative five plus one halfis going to get us to this point rightover here.F of that is going to be thisdistance, this height right over here.This is consistent with these beingright handed rectangles.So, this is definitely the case.When I is equal to one we'redefinitely finding this area right over here.When I is equal to two it's going to benegative five plus two over two.So two over two, we're going to addone, we're going to go over here.So once again we're doing one half,which is this right over here.That's the width times F of negative fiveplus two over two, which is F of negativefour, which is this height right over here.So, once again that is that area.You can keep following it.Everytime we're taking the functionthis first one is negative fiveplus one half, and then for eachincrement we're adding a half toI guess the right hand side is one wayto think about it.So, this actually makes complete sense.We're doing this for the first eightso this is indeed true.This is the sum of the areasof the blue rectangles.Now let's look at this one over here.The sum of the areas of the red rectangles.At first this looks pretty interesting.We're taking the sum of 16 things,and we do indeed have 16 thingsright over here.We have the width of each of those16 things or for each of those thingswe want to figure out an area,and it is indeed the case that eachof these has a width of one half.But what happens when we take F ofnegative one plus I over two.So, we're starting right over here atnegative one.Negative one plus I over two.When I equals one we're goingto be at this point right over here,and F of that is going to be --You might say, ""Hey, isn't that goingto be the height of that rectangle?When I equals two isn't it going to bethe height of that rectangle?And when I is equal to three isn't itgoing to be the height of that rectangle?""And that's where we have to be very careful.They're going to have the sameabsolute value, but these are going to bethese are all going to be negative values.These are all going to be negativebecause we see between this value ofour function.So that looks like between negativeone half all the way to seven our functionis actually negative.So one way to think about it, you'd behaving negative height so when youmultiply these two things you're goingto get a negative number.So this whole thing is going to bea negative number and so you'reessentially going to get the negative of the sumsof the areas of the red rectangles,but that's not the same thing as thesum of the areas of the red rectangles.An area is, at least in the traditional sense,you would expect to have, if you werejust seeing what's the area how much carpetyou would need to cover this someone would saythat will be a positive value.But this is going to be a negative versionof that.So that is not the sum of the areasof the areas of the red rectangles.It's the negative of the areas of the redrectangles. So we'd rule that one out.Then this last choice.So, this expression is the sumof the areas of all the rectangles.And so this one is going from I equalsone to 24.So it's literally 24 things.It's starting here and it just keeps going.And if this said from I equals one to I equalseight it would be the first choice,but then this falls into the problemagain of once we get past, when we get to Iequal nine this thing right over herewill turn negative, and it's goingto give the negative area.So it's essentially going to net outthis positive area against this negativearea right over here.So it's not the sum of the areasof all the rectangles.It's going to be this areaessentially minus this area right over there."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-defining-integrals-with-riemann-sums/v/riemann-sums-and-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00We've done several videos alreadywhere we're approximating the area under a curveby breaking up that area into rectanglesand then finding the sum of the areas of those rectanglesas an approximation.And this was actually the first examplethat we looked at where each of the rectangleshad an equal width.So we equally partitioned the intervalbetween our two boundaries between a and b.And the height of the rectangle was the functionevaluated at the left endpoint of each rectangle.And we wanted to generalize it and write it in sigma notation.It looked something like this.And this was one case.Later on, we looked at a situationwhere you define the height by the functionvalue at the right endpoint or at the midpoint.And then we even constructed trapezoids.And these are all particular instances of Riemann sums.So this right over here is a Riemann sum.And when people talk about Riemann sums,they're talking about the more general notion.You don't have to just do it this way.You could use trapezoids.You don't even have to have equally-spaced partitions.I used equally-spaced partitions because it made thingsa little bit conceptually simpler.And this right here is a picture of the personthat Riemann sums was named after.This is Bernhard Riemann.And he made many contributions to mathematics.But what he is most known for, at leastif you're taking a first-year calculus course,is the Riemann sum.And how this is used to define the Riemann integral.Both Newton and Leibniz had come upwith the idea of the integral whenthey had formulated calculus, but the Riemann integralis kind of the most mainstream formal,or I would say rigorous, definitionof what an integral is.So as you could imagine, this is one instance of a Riemann sum.We have n right over here.The larger n is, the better an approximation it's going to be.So his definition of an integral, whichis the actual area under the curve,or his definition of a definite integral, whichis the actual area under a curve between a and bis to take this Riemann sum, it doesn't have to be this one,take any Riemann sum, and take the limit as n approachesinfinity.So just to be clear, what's happeningwhen n approaches infinity?Let me draw another diagram here.So let's say that's my y-axis.This is my x-axis.This is my function.As n approaches infinity-- so this is a,this is b-- you're just going to have a ton of rectangles.You're just going to get a ton of rectangles over there.And there are going to become better and betterapproximations for the actual area.And the actual area under the curveis denoted by the integral from a to b of f of x times dx.And you see where this is coming fromor how these notations are close.Or at least in my brain, how they're connected.Delta x was the width for each of these sections.This right here is delta x.So that is a delta x.This is another delta x.This is another delta x.A reasonable way to conceptualize what dx is,or what a differential is, is what delta xapproaches, if it becomes infinitely small.So you can conceptualize this, and it's nota very rigorous way of thinking about it,is an infinitely small-- but not 0-- infinitely small deltax, is one way that you can conceptualize this.So once again, as you have your functiontimes a little small change in delta x.And you are summing, although you'resumming an infinite number of these things, from a to b.So I'm going to leave you there justso that you see the connection.You know the name for these things.And once again, this one over here, thisisn't the only Riemann sum.In fact, this is often called the left Riemann sumif you're using it with rectangles.You can do a right Riemann sum.You could use the midpoint.You could use a trapezoid.But if you take the limit of any of those Riemann sums,as n approaches infinity, then that youget as a Riemann definition of the integral.Now so far, we haven't talked about howto actually evaluate this thing.This is just a definition right now.And for that we will do in future videos.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-defining-integrals-with-riemann-sums/v/rewriting-definite-integral-as-limit-of-riemann-sum	khanacademy	video	:02- [Instructor] Let's get some practicerewriting definite integralsas the limit of a Riemann sum.So let's say I wanted to take the definite integralfrom pi to two pi of cosine of x dx.And I what I wanna do is I wanna write itas the limit as n approaches infinity of a Riemann sum.So it's gonna take the form of the limitas n approaches infinity, and we can haveour Sigma notation right over here,and I would say from, let's sayi is equal to one all the way to n.Let me scroll down a little bitso it doesn't get all squashed up at the top.Of, and so let's me draw what's actually going onso that we can get a better senseof what to write here within the Sigma notation.So let me do it large.So if this is pi right over here,this would be three pi over twoand this would be two pi right over here, two pi.Now what does the graph of cosine of x do?Well, at pi cosine of pi is negative one.So that's negative one there.And cosine of two pi is one.And so the graph is gonna do something like this,and this is obviously just a hand-drawn version of it,but you have seen cosine functions before,this is just part of it.And so this definite integral representsthe area from pi to two pibetween the curve and the x axis.And you might already know that this area is going to be,or this part of the definite integral'd be negativeand this would be positive, and it will cancel outand this would all actually end up being zero in this case.But this exercise for this video is to rewrite thisas a limit as n approaches infinity of a Riemann sum.So there's a Riemann sum, what we wanna dois think about breaking this upinto a bunch of rectangles.So let's say, or I should say n rectangles.So that's our first one right over there,then this might be our second one,and let's do right Riemann sumwhere the right boundary of our rectangle,what the value of the function is at that point,that's what defines the height.So that's our second one all the way until this oneright over here is going to be our n-th one.So this is one, let me write it this way.This is i is equal to one,this is i is equal to two, all the wayuntil we get to i is equal to n.And then if we take the limit as n approaches infinity,the sum of the areas of these rectanglesare gonna get better and better and better.And so let's first think about it, what is the widthof each of these rectangles going to be?Well, I am taking this interval from pi to two piand I'm gonna divide it into n equal intervals.So the width of each of these,the width of each of these is going to betwo pi minus pi, so I'm just takingthe difference between my bounds of integration,and I am dividing by n, which is equal to pi over n.So that's the width of each of these.That's pi over n, this is pi over n, this is pi of n.And what's the height of each of these rectangles?Remember this is a right Riemann sum.So it's going to be the right end of our rectangleis going to define the height.So this right over here, what would this height be?Well, this height, this value I should say,this is going to be equal to f of what?Well, this was pi and this is going to be piplus the length of our interval right over here,the base of the rectangle.So we started at pi, so it's gonna be pi plus,this was going to be pi over n, I could say times one.That's this height right over here.What's this one going to be right over here?Well, this one is going to be f of pi,our first start, plus pi over n times what?We're gonna have pi over n two times.Pi over n times two.So the general form of the right boundaryis going to be, so for example, this heightright over here, this is going to be f of,we started at pi plus,we're doing the right Riemann sum,so we're gonna add pi over n n times by this point.Pi over n times n.Or, if we wanted to say it generally,if we're talking about the i-th rectangle,remember we sum them all up, what's the height?Well, the height is going to be, in this caseit's going to be cosine of pi plus,if we're with the i-th rectangle,we are going to add pi over n i times.Pi over n times i.And then, that's the height of each of our rectangles.And then what's the width?Well, we already figured that out.Times pi over n.And if you wanna be careful and make surethat this Sigma notation applies to the whole thing,there you have it.We have just re-expressed this definite integralas the limit of a right Riemann sum.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-defining-integrals-with-riemann-sums/v/writing-riemann-sum-limit-as-definite-integral	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So, we've got a Riemann sum.We're gonna take the limit as N approaches infinityand the goal of this videois to see if we can rewrite thisas a definite integral.I encourage you to pause the videoand see if you can work through it on your own.So, let's remind ourselveshow a definite integral can relate to a Riemann sum.So, if I have the definite integral from A to Bof F of X, F of X, DX,we have seen in other videosthis is going to be the limitas N approaches infinity of the sum, capital sigma,going from I equals one to Nand so, essentially we're gonna sum the areasof a bunch of rectangleswhere the width of each of those rectangleswe can write as a delta X,so your width is going to be delta Xof each of those rectanglesand then your heightis going to be the value of the functionevaluated some place in that delta X.If we're doing a right Riemann sumwe would do the right end of that rectangleor of that sub intervaland so, we would start at our lower bound Aand we would add as many delta Xs as our index specifies.So, if I is equal to one,we add one delta X,so we would be at the right of the first rectangle.If I is equal two, we add two delta Xs.So, this is going to be delta Xtimes our index.So, this is the general formthat we have seen beforeand so, one possibility, you could even do a little bitof pattern matching right here,our function looks like the natural log function,so that looks like our func F of X,it's the natural log function,so I could write that,so F of X looks like the natural log of X.What else do we see?Well, A, that looks like two.A is equal to two.What would our delta X be?Well, you can see this right over here,this thing that we're multiplyingthat just is divided by Nand it's not multiplying by an I,this looks like our delta Xand this right over here looks like delta X times I.So, it looks like our delta X is equal to five over N.So, what can we tell so far?Well, we could say that, okay, this thing up here,up the original thing is going to be equal tothe definite integral,we know our lower bound is going from twoto we haven't figured out our upper bound yet,we haven't figured out our B yetbut our function is the natural logof X and then I will just write a DX here.So, in order to complete writingthis definite integralI need to be able to write the upper boundand the way to figure out the upper boundis by looking at our delta Xbecause the way that we would figure out a delta Xfor this Riemann sum here,we would say that delta X is equal to the differencebetween our bounds divided by how many sectionswe want to divide it in, divided by N.So, it's equals to B minus A,B minus A over N, over Nand so, you can pattern match here.If this is delta X is equal to B minus A over N.Let me write this down.So, this is going to be equal to B,B minus our A which is two,all of that over N,so B minus twois equal to fivewhich would make B equal to seven.B is equal to seven.So, there you have it.We have our original limit, our Riemann limitor our limit of our Riemann sumbeing rewritten as a definite integral.And once again, I want to emphasizewhy this makes sense.If we wanted to draw thisit would look something like this,I'm gonna try to hand draw the natural log function,it looks something like thisand this right over here would be oneand so, let's say this is twoand so going from two to seven,this isn't exactly rightand so, our definite integral is concerned with the areaunder the curve from two until sevenand so, this Riemann sum you can viewas an approximation when N isn't approaching infinitybut what you're saying is look,when I is equal to one,your first one is going to be of width five over N,so this is essentially saying our differencebetween two and seven,we're taking that distance five,dividing it into N rectangles,and so, this first one is going to have a width of fiveover N and then what's the height gonna be?Well, it's a right Riemann sum,so we're using the value of the function right over there,write it two plus five over N.So, this value right over here.This is the natural log,the natural log of two plus five over N,and since this is the first rectangletimes one, times one.Now we could keep going.This one right over herethe width is the same, five over Nbut what's the height?Well, the height here, this height right over hereis going to be the natural logof two plus five over N times two, times two.This is for I is equal to two.This is I is equal to one.And so, hopefully you are seeing that this makes sense.The area of this first rectangleis going to be natural log of twoplus five over N times onetimes five over Nand the second one over here,natural log of two plus five over N times twotimes five over Nand so, this is calculating the sumof the areas of these rectanglesbut then it's taking the limit as N approaches infinityso we get better and better approximationsgoing all the way to the exact area.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-and-accumulation-functions/v/fundamental-theorem-of-calculus	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say I have some function f thatis continuous on an interval between a and b.And I have these brackets here, so it also includes a and bin the interval.So let me graph this just so we geta sense of what I'm talking about.So that's my vertical axis.This is my horizontal axis.I'm going to label my horizontal axist so we can save x for later.I can still make this y right over there.And let me graph.This right over here is the graph of y is equal to f of t.Now our lower endpoint is a, so that's a right over there.Our upper boundary is b.Let me make that clear.And actually just to show that we're including that endpoint,let me make them bold lines, filled in lines.So lower boundary, a, upper boundary, b.We're just saying and I've drawn itthis way that f is continuous on that.Now let's define some new function.Let's define some new function that'sthe area under the curve between a and some pointthat's in our interval.Let me pick this right over here, x.So let's define some new functionto capture the area under the curve between a and x.Well, how do we denote the area under the curvebetween two endpoints?Well, we just use our definite integral.That's our Riemann integral.It's really that right now before we come upwith the conclusion of this video,it really just represents the areaunder the curve between two endpoints.So this right over here, we can sayis the definite integral from a to x of f of t dt.Now this right over here is going to be a function of x--and let me make it clear-- where xis in the interval between a and b.This thing right over here is goingto be another function of x.This value is going to depend on what x we actually choose.So let's define this as a function of x.So I'm going to say that this is equal to uppercase F of x.So all fair and good.Uppercase F of x is a function.If you give me an x value that's between a and b,it'll tell you the area under lowercase fof t between a and x.Now the cool part, the fundamental theoremof calculus.The fundamental theorem of calculustells us-- let me write this downbecause this is a big deal.Fundamental theorem-- that's not an abbreviation-- theoremof calculus tells us that if we wereto take the derivative of our capital F,so the derivative-- let me make sure I have enough space here.So if I were to take the derivative of capitalF with respect to x, which is the same thing as takingthe derivative of this with respectto x, which is equal to the derivative of allof this business-- let me copy this.So copy and then paste, which is the same thing.I've defined capital F as this stuff.So if I'm taking the derivative of the left hand side,it's the same thing as taking the derivativeof the right hand side.The fundamental theorem of calculustells us that this is going to be equal to lowercase f of x.Now why is this a big deal?Why does it get such an important titleas the fundamental theorem of calculus?Well, it tells us that for any continuous functionf, if I define a function, that is,the area under the curve between a and x right over here,that the derivative of that function is going to be f.So let me make it clear.Every continuous function, every continuous f,has an antiderivative capital F of x.That by itself is a cool thing.But the other really cool thing-- or Iguess these are somewhat related.Remember, coming into this, all we did,we just viewed the definite integralas symbolizing as the area under the curve between two points.That's where that Riemann definition of integrationcomes from.But now we see a connection between that and derivatives.When you're taking the definite integral,one way of thinking, especially if you'retaking a definite integral between a lowerboundary and an x, one way to think about it is you'reessentially taking an antiderivative.So we now see a connection-- and thisis why it is the fundamental theorem of calculus.It connects differential calculusand integral calculus-- connection between derivatives,or maybe I should say antiderivatives, derivativesand integration.Which before this video, we just viewed integration as areaunder curve.Now we see it has a connection to derivatives.Well, how would you actually use the fundamental theoremof calculus?Well, maybe in the context of a calculus class.And we'll do the intuition for why this happensor why this is true and maybe a proof in later videos.But how would you actually apply this right over here?Well, let's say someone told you that theywant to find the derivative.Let me do this in a new color justto show this is an example.Let's say someone wanted to find the derivative with respectto x of the integral from-- I don't know.I'll pick some random number here.So pi to x -- I'll put something crazy here --cosine squared of t over the natural logof t minus the square root of t dt.So they want you take the derivative with respectto x of this crazy thing.Remember, this thing in the parentheses is a function of x.Its value, it's going to have a value that is dependent on x.If you give it a different x, it'sgoing to have a different value.So what's the derivative of this with respect to x?Well, the fundamental theorem of calculus tells usit can be very simple.We essentially-- and you can even pattern match up here.And we'll get more intuition of whythis is true in future videos.But essentially, everywhere whereyou see this right over here is an f of t.Everywhere you see a t, replace it with an xand it becomes an f of x.So this is going to be equal to cosine squaredof x over the natural log of x minus the square root of x.You take the derivative of the indefinite integral wherethe upper boundary is x right over here.It just becomes whatever you were taking the integral of,that as a function instead of t, that is now a function x.So it can really simplify sometimes taking a derivative.And sometimes you'll see on exams these trick problemswhere you had this really hairy thing that youneed to take a definite integral of and then takethe derivative, and you just haveto remember the fundamental theorem of calculus,the thing that ties it all together,connects derivatives and integration,that you can just simplify it by realizing that this is justgoing to be instead of a function lowercase f of t,it's going to be lowercase f of x.Let me make it clear.In this example right over here, this right over herewas lowercase f of t.And now it became lowercase f of x.This right over here was our a.And notice, it doesn't matter whatthe lower boundary of a actually is.You don't have anything on the right handside that is in some way dependent on a.Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.And in the next few videos, we'll think about the intuitionand do more examples making use of the fundamental theoremof calculus.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-and-accumulation-functions/v/functions-defined-by-definite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] You've already spent a lot ofyour mathematical lives talking about functions.The basic idea is give a valid input into a function,so a member of that function's domain,and then the function is going to tell you for that inputwhat is going to be the corresponding output.And we call that corresponding output f of x.So, for example, there's many ways of defining functions.You could say something like f of x is equal to x squared.So that means that whatever x,whatever you input into the function,the output is going to be that input squared.You could have something defined like this.F of x is equal tox squaredif x odd.And you could say it's equal to x to the third otherwise,otherwise.So if it's an odd integer,it's an odd integer, you just square it.But otherwise, for any other real number,you take it to the third power.This is a valid way of defining a function.What we're going to do in this video is explore a new wayor potentially a new way for you of defining a function.And that's by using a definite integral,but it's the same general idea.So what we have graphed here, this is the t-axis,this is the y-axis, and we have the graph of the function f,or you could view this as the graph ofy is equal tof of t.Now, what I want to,and this is another way of representingwhat outputs you might get for a given input.Here, if t is one, f of t is five.If t is four, f of t is three.But I'm now going to define a new functionbased on a definite integral of f of t.Let's define our new function.Let's say g,let's call it g of x.Let's make it equal to the definite integralfrom negative twoto xof f of tdt.Now, pause this video, really take a look at it.This might look really fancy, but what's happening here is,given an input x, g of x is going to be based onwhat the definite integral here would be for that x.And so we can set up a little table hereto think about some potential values.So let's say x, and let's say g of x right over here.So if x is one,what is g of x going to be equal to?All right, so g of oneis going to be equal to the definite integral,going from negative two.Now x is going to be equal to one in this situation.That's what we're inputting into the function.So one is our upper bound of f of t dt.And what is that equal to?Well, that's going to be the areaunder the curve and above the t-axis,between t equals negative two and t is equal to one.So it's going to be this area here.And we, since it's on a grid,we can actually figure this out.We can actually break this up into two sections.This rectangular section is three wide and five high,so it has an area of 15 square units.And this little triangular section up hereis two wide and one high.Two times one times one half,area of a triangle, this is going to be another one.So that area is going to be equal to 16.What ifx is equal totwo?What is g of two going to be equal to?Pause this video, and try to figure that out.Well, g of two is going to be equal to the definite integralfrom negative two, and now our upper bound's going to beour input into the function to two, of f of t dt.So that's going to be going from here,all the way now to here.And so it's the area we just calculated.It's all of this stuff,which we figured out was 16 square units,plus another one, two, three, four, five square units.So 16 plus five, this is going to be equal to 21.So hopefully that helps,and the key thing to appreciate here is that we can definevalid functions by using definite integrals.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-and-accumulation-functions/v/applying-the-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] Let's say that we have the function g of x,and it is equal to the definite integral from 19 to xof the cube root of t dt.And what I'm curious about findingor trying to figure out is, what is g prime of 27?What is that equal to?Pause this video and try to think about it,and I'll give you a little bit of a hint.Think about the second fundamental theorem of calculus.All right, now let's work on this together.So we wanna figure out what g prime,we could try to figure out what g prime of x is,and then evaluate that at 27,and the best way that I can think about doing thatis by taking the derivative of both sides of this equation.So let's take the derivative of both sides of that equation.So the left-hand side, we'll take the derivativewith respect to x of g of x,and the right-hand side, the derivative with respect to xof all of this business.Now, the left-hand side is pretty straight forward.The derivative with respect to x of g of x,that's just going to be g prime of x,but what is the right-hand side going to be equal to?Well, that's where the second fundamental theoremof calculus is useful.I'll write it right over here.Second fundamental, I'll abbreviate a little bit,theorem of calculus.It tells us, let's say we have some function capital F of x,and it's equal to the definite integral from a,sum constant a to x of lowercase f of t dt.The second fundamental theorem of calculus tells usthat if our lowercase f,if lowercase f is continuous on the interval from a to x,so I'll write it this way,on the closed interval from a to x,then the derivative of our capital f of x,so capital F prime of x is just going to be equalto our inner function f evaluated at x instead of tis going to become lowercase f of x.Now, I know when you first saw this,you thought that, ""Hey, this might be some cryptic thing""that you might not use too often.""Well, we're gonna see that it's actually very, very usefuland even in the future, and some of you might already know,there's multiple ways to tryto think about a definite integral like this,and you'll learn it in the future.But this can be extremely simplifying,especially if you have a hairy definite integral like this,and so this just tells us, hey, look, the derivativewith respect to x of all of this business,first we have to check that our inner function,which would be analogous to our lowercase f here,is this continuous on the interval from 19 to x?Well, no matter what x is,this is going to be continuous over that interval,because this is continuous for all x's,and so we meet this first condition or our major condition,and so then we can just say, all right,then the derivative of all of thisis just going to be this inner function replacing t with x.So we're going to get the cube root,instead of the cube root of t,you're gonna get the cube root of x.And so we can go back to our original question,what is g prime of 27 going to be equal to?Well, it's going to be equal to the cube root of 27,which is of course equal to three, and we're done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-and-accumulation-functions/v/derivative-with-ftc-and-chain-rule	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's say that we have the functioncapital F of x,which we're going to define as the definite integralfrom one to sine of x,so that's an interesting upper bound right over there,of two t minus one,and of course, dt,and what we are curious aboutis trying to figure out what is F prime of x goingto be equal to?So pause this video and see if you can figure that out.All right.So some of you might have been a little bit challengedby this notion of hey,instead of an x on this upper bound,I now have a sine of x.If it was just an x,I could have used the fundamental theorem of calculus.Just to review that,if I had a function, let me call it h of x,if I have h of x that was defined as the definite integralfrom one to x of two t minus one dt,we know from the fundamental theorem of calculusthat h prime of xwould be simply this inner functionwith the t replaced by the x.It would just be two x minus one, pretty straightforward.But this one isn't quite as straightforward.Instead of having an x up here,our upper bound is a sine of x.So one way to think about it is if we were to define g of xas being equal to sine of x,equal to sine of x,our capital F of x can be expressed as capital F of xis the same thing as h of,h of, instead of an x,everywhere we see an x,we're replacing it with a sine of x,so it's h of g of x, g of x.You can see the g of x right over there.So you replace x with g of xfor where, in this expression,you get h of g of xand that is capital F of x.Now why am I doing all of that?Well, this might start making you thinkabout the chain rule.Because if this is true,then that means that capital F prime of xis going to be equal to h prime of g of x,h prime of g of xtimes g prime of x.And so what would that be?Well, we already know what h prime of x is,so I'll need to do this in another color.This part right over here is going to be equalto everywhere we see an x here,we'll replace with a g of x,so it's going to be two,two times sine of x.Two sine of x,and then minus one, minus one.This is this right over here,and then what's g prime of x?G prime of x,well g prime of x is just, of course,the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x,is cosine of x.So this part right over hereis going to be cosine of x.And we could keep going.We could try to,we could try to simplify this a little bitor rewrite it in different ways,but there you have it.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-interpreting-the-behavior-of-accumulation-functions/v/interpreting-behavior-of-antiderivative	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let g of x be equal to the definite integralfrom zero to x of f of t dt.What is an appropriate calculus-based justificationfor the fact that g is concave up on the open intervalfrom five to 10?So concave up.So before I even think about what it means to be concave up,let's just make sure we understand this relationshipbetween g and f.One way to understand it is if we took the derivativeof both sides of this equation,we would get that g prime of x is equal to f of x.The derivative of thiswith respect to x would just be f of x.In fact, the whole reason why we introducedthis variable t here is this thing right over hereis actually a function of x'cause x is this upper bound.And it would've been weird if we had x as an upper bound,or at least confusing,and we were also integrating with respect to x.So we just had to pick kind of another placeholder variable.Didn't have to be t.It could be alpha, it could be gamma,it could be a, b, or c, whatever we choose,but this is still, right over here, this is a function of x.But when you take the derivative of both sides,you realize that the function f, which is graphed here.And if this were the x axis, then this would be f of x.If this is the t axis,then this is y is equal to f of t.But generally this is the graph of our function f,which you could also view as the graph of g prime.If this is x, this would be g prime of x.And so we're thinking about the interval,the open interval from five to 10,and we have g's derivative graphed here.And we wanna know a calculus-based justificationfrom this graph that lets us know that g is concave up.So what does it mean to be concave up?Well, that means that your slope of tangent line,of tangent, slope of tangent is increasing.Or another way of thinking about it,your derivative is increasing.Or another way to think about it,if your derivative is increasing over an interval,then you're concave up on that interval.And so here we have a graph of the derivative,and it is indeed increasing over that interval.So our calculus-based justificationthat we'd wanna use is that, look,f, which is g prime, is increasing on that interval.The derivative is increasing on that interval,which means that the original function is concave up.f is positive on that interval.That's not a sufficient calculus-based justification.Because if your derivative is positive,that just means your original function is increasing.It doesn't tell youthat your original function is concave up.f is concave up on the interval.Well, just because your derivative is concave updoesn't mean that your original function is concave up.In fact, you could have a situation like thiswhere you're concave up over that interval,but for much of that interval right over here,if this was our graph of f or g prime, we are decreasing.And if we're decreasing over much of that interval,then actually on this partour original function would be concave down.The graph of g has a cup U shape on the interval.Well, if we had the graph of g,this would be a justification,but it wouldn't be a calculus-based justification.Let's do more of these.So this next one says, so we have the exact same setup,which actually all of these examples will have.g of x is equal to this thing here.What is an appropriate calculus-based justificationfor the fact that g has a relative minimumat x equals eight?So once again, they've graphed f here,which is the same thing as the derivative of g.And so if we have the graph of the derivative,how do we know that we have a relative minimumat x equals eight?Well, the fact that we cross,that we're at the x-axis, that y is equal to zero,that the derivative is equal to zero at x equals eight,that tells us that the slope of the tangent lineof g at that point is zero.But that alone does not tell uswe have a relative minimum point.In order to have a relative minimum point,our derivative has to cross from being negative to positive.Why is that valuable?Because think about if your derivative goesfrom being negative to positive,that means your original function goesfrom decreasing to increasing.It goes from decreasing to increasing.And so you would have a relative minimum point.And the choice that describes that,this is starting to get there,but this alone isn't enough for a relative minimum point.f is negative before x equals eightand positive after x equals eight.That's exactly what we just described.Let's see about these.f is concave up on the interval around x equals six.Well, x equals six is a little bit unrelated to that.There's an interval in the graph of g around x equals eightwhere g of eight is the smallest value.Well, this would be a justification for a relative minimum,but it is not calculus-based.So once again I'll rule that one out as well.Let's do one more of these.So same setup, although we have a different f and g here,and we see it every time with the graph.What is a appropriate calculus-based justificationfor the fact that g is positive on the intervalfrom the closed interval from seven to 12?So the positive on the closed interval from seven to 12.So this is interesting.Let's just remind ourselves.Here we're gonna think a little bit deeperabout what it means to be this definite integralfrom zero to x.So, if we think about what happens when x is equal to seven.When x is equal to seven, or another way to think about it,g of seven is going to be the integralfrom zero to seven of f of t dt.And so the integral from zero to seven,if this was a t-axis,and, once again, t is just kind of a placeholder variableto help us keep this x up here.But we're really talking about this area right over here.And because from zero to seventhis function is above the x-axis,this is going to be a positive area.This is a positive area.And as we go from seven to 12,we're not adding anymore area,but we're also not taking any away.So actually g of seven all the way to g of 12is going to be the same positive value,'cause we're not adding anymore value.And when I say g of 12,g of 12 is going to be actually equal to g of seven,because, once again, no added area right here,positive or negative.So let's see which of these choices match.For an x value in the interval from seven to 12,the value of f of x is zero.That is true, but that doesn't mean that we were positive.For example, before that intervalif our function did something like this,then we would've had negative area up to that point,and so these would be negative values,so I would rule that out.For any x value in the interval from seven to 12,the closed interval, the value of g of x is positive.For any x value in the interval from seven to 12,the value of g of x is positive.That is true, so I like this one.Let me see these other ones.f is positive over the closed interval from zero to seven,and it is non-negative over seven to 12.I like this one as well.And actually the reason why I would rule out this first one,this first one has nothing to do with the derivativeand so it's not a calculus-based justification,so I would rule that one out.This one is good.This is the exact rationale that I was talking about.f is positive from zero to seven,so it develops all this positive area,and it's non-negative over the interval.And so we are going to stay positive this entire time for g,which is the area under f and above the x-axis from zeroto our whatever x we wanna pick.So I like this choice here.f is neither concave up nor concave downover the closed interval from seven to 12.No, that doesn't really help usin saying that g is positive over that interval.So there you go, choice C.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/negative-definite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We've already thought aboutwhat a definite integral means.If I'm taking the definite integral from a to bof f of x dx,I can just view that as the areabelow my function f.So if this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis,and y is equal to f of x, so something like that.Y is equal to f of x.And if this is aand if this is b,I could just viewthis expression as being equal to this area.But what if my function was not above the x-axis?What if it was below the x-axis?So these are going to be equivalent.Let's say, let me just draw that scenario.So let me draw a scenario wherethat's my x-axis,that is my y-axis.And let's say I have,let's say I have a function that looks like that.So that is y is equal to g of x.And let's say that this right over here is a,and this right over here is b.And let's say that this arearight over here is equal to five.Well, if I were to ask youwhat is the definite integral from a to bof g of x dx, what do you think it is going to be?Well, you might be tempted to say, hey, well,it's just the area again between my curve and the x-axis.You might be tempted to say, hey,this is just going to be equal to five.But you have to be very careful.Because if you're looking at the area above your curveand below your x-axis,versus below your curve and above the x-axis,this definite integral is actually going to bethe negative of the area.Now, we'll see later on why this will work out nicelywith a whole set of integration properties.But if you want to get some intuition for it,let's just think about velocity versus time graphs.So,if I,in my horizontal axis, that is time.My vertical axis, this is velocity.And velocity is going to be measured in meters per second.Time is going to be measured in seconds.Time is measured in seconds.And actually, I'm going to do two scenarios here.So let's say that I have a first velocity time graph.Let's just call it v one of t, which is equal to three.And it would be three meters per second, so one, two, three.So it wouldlook like that.That is v one of t.And if I were to look at the definite integralgoing from time equals one to time equals fiveof v sub one of t dt, what would this be equal to?Well, here my function is above my t-axis.So I'll just go from one tofive, which will be around there.And I could just think about the area here,and this area is pretty easy to calculate.It's going to be three meters per second times four seconds.That's my change in time.And so this is going to be 12 meters.And so this is going to be equal to 12.And one way to conceptualize thisis this gives us our change in position.If my velocity is three meters per second,and since it's positive you can conceptualize thatas it's going to the right at three meters per second.What is my change in position?Well, I would have gone 12 meters to the right.And you don't need calculus to figure that out.Three meters per second times four secondswould be 12 meters.But what if it were the other way around?What if I had another velocity function,;et's call that v sub two of t,that is equal to negative two meters per second?And it's just a constant negative two meters per second.So this isv sub two of t right over here.What would or what shouldthe definite integral from one to five of v sub two of t be,dt be equal to?Well, it should be equal to my change in position.But if my velocity is negative,that means I'm moving to the left.That means my change in position should be to the left,as opposed to to the right.And so we can just look at this area right over here.When if you just look at it as the rectangle,it's going to be two times four, which is equal to eight.But you have to be very careful.Since it is below my horizontal axis and above my function,this is going to be negative.And this should make a lot of sense.If I'm going two meters per second to the leftfor four seconds, or another way to think about it,if I'm going negative two meters per secondfor four seconds, then my change in positionis going to be negative eight meters.I would have moved eight meters to the left,if we say the convention is negative means to the left.So the big takeaway is,if it's below your function and above the horizontal axis,the definite integral, and if your a is less than b,then your definite integral is going to be positive.If your a is less than b,but your function over that interval isbelow the horizontal axis,then your definite integral is going to be negative.And in the future, we'll also lookat definite integrals that are a mix of both,but that's a little bit more complicated.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/same-integration-bounds	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We've already taken definite integralsand we've seen how they represent or denotethe area under a function between two pointsand above the X axis.But let's do something interesting.Let's think about a definite integral of F of X DX,It's the area under the curve, F of X, but instead of itbeing mean between two different X values,say A and B like we see in multiple times,let's say it's between the same one.Let's say it's between C and C.Let's say C is right over here.What do you think this thing right over hereis going to be equal to?What does this represent?What is this equal to?I encourage you to pause the videoand try to think about it.Well if you try to visualize it, you're thinking,well the area under the curve F of X,above the X axis, from X equals C to X equals C.So this region, I guess we could call it,that we think about it, does have a height.The height here is F of C.What's the width?Well there is no width, we're just at a single point.We're not going from C to C plus some delta Xor C plus some even very small change in Xor C plus some other very small a value.We're just, saying at the point C.When we're thinking about area we're thinkingabout how much two-dimensional space you're taking up.But this idea, this is just a one-dimensional,I think you could think of it as a line segment.What's the area of a line segment?Well a line segment has no area.So this thing right over hereis going to be equal to zero.Now you might say, I get that.I see why that could make sense,why that makes intuitive sense.I'm trying to find the area of a rectanglewhere I know it's height, but it's width is zero.So that areas going to be zerois one way to think about it.But Sal, why are you even pointing this out to me?As well see, especially when we do more complexdefinite integration problems and solving thingssometimes recognizing this will help yousimplify an integration problem dramatically.Or you could work to be able to get to a point like thisso that you can cancel things out.Or you can say, hey that thing right over thereis just going to be equal to zero.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/integrating-scaled-function	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] We've already seen and you're probablygetting tired of me pointing it out repeatedly,that this yellow area right over here, this area underthe curve y is equal to f of x and above thepositive x-axis or I guess I can say just abovethe x-axis between x equals a and x equals b,that we can denote this area right over here as the definiteintegral of from a to b of f of x dx.Now what I want to explore in this video and it'llcome up with kind of an answer that you probablycould have guessed on your own, but at least getan intuition for it, is that I want to startthinking about the area under the curvethat's a scaled version of f of x.Let's say it's y is equal to c times f of x.Y is equal to some number timesf of x, so it's scaling f of x.And so I want this to be kind of some arbitrarynumber, but just to help me visualize, you know I haveto draw something so I'm just gonna kind of in myhead let's just pretend the c isa three for visualization purposes.So it's going to be three times, so instead of one,instead of this far right over hereit's going to be about this far.For right over here, instead of this far right overhere it's going to be that and another right over there.And then instead of it's going to be about there.And then instead of it being like that it's goingto be one, two and then three, right around there.So I'm starting to get a sense of what this curveis going to look like, a scaled version of f of x.And at least what I'm drawing is pretty close tothree times f of x, but just to give you an ideais going to look something like,and let's see over here if this distance,do a second one, a third one, is gonna be up here.It's gonna look something like this.It's gonna look something like that.So this is a scaled version and the scale I did right hereI assumed a positive c greater than zero,but this is just for visualization purposes.Now what do we think the area under thiscurve is going to be between a and b?So what do we think this arearight over here is going to be?Now we already know how we can denote it.That area right over there is equal to the definiteintegral from a to b of the functionwe're integrating is c f of x dx.I guess to make the question a little bit clearer,how does this relate to this?How does this green area relate to this yellow area?Well one way to think about it is we just scaledthe vertical dimension up by c, so one way that you couldreason it is if I'm finding the area of something,if I have the area of a rectangle and I have thevertical dimension is let's say I don't want touse those same letters over and over again.Well let's say the vertical dimension is alphaand the horizontal dimension is beta.We know that the area is going to be alpha times beta.Now if I scale up the vertical dimension by c,so instead of alpha this is c times alpha andthis is, the width is beta, if I scale up the verticaldimension by c so this is now c times alpha,what's the area going to be?Well it's going to be c alpha times beta,or another way to think of it,when I scale one of the dimensions by c I take myold area and I scale up my old area up by c.And that's what we're doing, we're scalingup the vertical dimension by c.When you multiply c times f of x,f of x is giving us the vertical height.Now obviously that changes as our x changes,but when you think back to the Reimann sumsthe f of x was what gave us the height of our rectangles.We're now scaling up the height or scaling I should saybecause we might be scaling down depending on the c.We're scaling it, we're scaling one dimension by c.If you scale one dimension by cyou're gonna scale the area by c.So this right over here, the integral,let me just rewrite it.The integral from a to b of c f of x dx,that's just going to be the scaled, we're justgoing to take the area of f of x,so let me do that in the same color.We're going to take the area under the curvef of x from a to b f of x dx andwe're just going to scale it up by this c.So you might say, ""Okay maybe I could have felt""that was, you know, if I have a c inside the integral""now I can take the c out of the integral"",and once again this is not a rigorous proof basedon the definition of the definite integral,but it hopefully gives you a littlebit of intuition why you can do this.If you scale up the function, you're essentiallyscaling up the vertical dimension, so the areaunder this is going to just be a scaled upversion of the area under the original function f of x.And once again really, really, really usefulproperty of definite integrals that's going tohelp us solve a bunch of definite integrals.And kind of clarify what we're even doing with them."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/switching-integral-bounds	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We've already seen one definitionof the definite integral, and many of themare closely related to this definitionthat we've already seen is the definite integralfrom a to b of f of x d of x is this area shadedin blue, and we can approximate itby splitting it into n rectangles.So let's say that's the first rectangle, one.That's the second rectangle, two, and you'regoing to go all the way to the nth rectangle,so this would be the n minus oneth rectangle.For the sake of this argument I'm going to makein this video, we're going to assumethat they're all the same width.So this is the nth rectangle.They all have the same width, and we see they'redefinitions of integration where you don't haveto have the same width here, but let's saythat each of those widths are delta x,and the way that we calculate delta x is we takeb minus a and we divide it by n,which is common sense, or this iswhat you learned in division.We're just taking this length and dividing itby n to get n equals spacings of delta x.So if you do this, you'll say, okay,well we see this multiple times,you can approximate it.You can approximate this area using these rectanglesas the sum from i equals one to n.So you're summing n of these rectangle's areaswhere the height of each of these rectanglesare going to be f of x sub i, where x sub iis the point at which you're taking the functionvalue to find out its height.So that could be x of one, x of two, x of three,so on and so forth, and you're multiplying thattimes your delta x.So you take x sub two, f of x sub twois that height right there.You multiply it times delta x.You get the area.We saw that when we looked at Riemann sumsand using that to approximate.We said, hey the one definition of the definite integralis that since this is the area this is goingto be the limit as n approaches infinityof this where delta x is defined as that.So let me just copy and paste that.So that's one way to think about it.Now, given this definition, what do you thinkthis, or maybe another way to think about it,how do you think this expression that I'm writingright over here based on this definitionshould relate to this expression?So notice, all I've done is I've segued from a to b.I'm now going from b to a.How do you think these two things should relate?I encourage you to look at all of thisto come to that conclusion,and pause the video to do so.Well let's just think about what's going to happen.This is going to be, if I were to literallyjust take this and copy and paste it, which isexactly what I'm going to do, if I just took this,by definition, since I swapped these two bounds,I'm going to want to swap these two.Instead of b minus a it's going to be a minus b now.It's going to be a minus b.This value right over here.Let me make these color-coded maybe.So this orange delta x is going to be the negativeof this green delta x.This is the negative of that right over there,and everything else is the same.So what am I going to end up doing?Well I'm essentially going to end up havingthe negative value of this.So this is going to be equal to the negativeof the integral from a to b of f of x dx.So this is the result we get, which is anotherreally important integration property,that if you swap the bounds of integration,and it really just comes from this idea,instead of delta x being b minus a, if you swapthe bounds of integration, it's going to be a minus b.We're going to get the negative delta x,or the negative of your original delta x,which is going to give you the negativeof this original value right over here.Once again, this is a really, really usefulintegration property where you're tryingto make sense of some integrals and evensometimes solve some of them.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/integrating-function-sums	khanacademy	video	":00- So we have a couple of functions here.This is the graph of y is equal to f of x.This is the graph of y is equal to g of x.And we already know something.Or we know ways to represent the areaunder the curve y equals f of x.Between these two points x is equal to a,and x is equal to b.So this area, right over here,between the curve and the x axis,between x equals a and x equals b,we know we can write that as the definite integral,from a to b, of f of x, dx.And we can do the same thing over here.We could call this area,let me pick a color that I have not used.Well, this is slightly different green.I could call this area right over here,the area right under the curve y is equal to g of x.And above the positive x axis,between x equals a and x equals b,we could call that the definite integral.From a to b of g of x, dx.Now given these two things,let's actually think about the area under the curveof the function created by the sum of these two functions.So what do I mean by that?So let me, this is actually a fun thing to do.Let me start again.That's exactly what we have over here.This is the graph of y is equal to f of x.But what I want to do, is I want to approximatethe graph of y is equal to, so my goal is to graphy is equal to f of x, plus g of x.So for any given x, it's going to be f of x.So that's that the f of x.And then I'm gonna add the g of x to it.So what will that look like?So that's gonna look like, let's see.When x is zero, g of x looks likeit's about that length right there.I'm obviously approximating it.So I'm gonna have to add that length right over here.So it'll probably be right around there.At x equals a, it's a little bit more.And so but now my f of x curve is gone, or has increased.But I take that same distance above it.If I add the g of x there,it gets me right about there.Once again I'm just eyeballing it,trying to get an approximation,giving me an intuition actually for f of x, plus g of x is.I'm just trying to add g of x for given x.Now let's see if I'm a little bit,let's say that I'm between a and b,g of x is about that distance right over there.So, if I wanted to put that same distance right over here,it gets me right about there.And then when x is equal to b, g of x is about that big,so I have to add that length, which is about,looks something like that.That actually looks a little bit too much.Maybe something like that.So, if I were to add the two, I'd get a curvethat looks something like this.And maybe it just keeps on going higher and higher.So, this is the curve.Or it's a pretty good approximation of the curveof f of x plus g of x.Now an interesting question is, is what would bewell, you know how we can represent this area.So the area under the curve f of x plus g of x,above the positive x axis,between x equals a and x equals b,we know we can represent that as,let me see, I have not used pink, yet.So, this area right over here,we know that that could be representedas the definite integral,from a to b of f of x, plus g of x, dx.Now the question is,how does this thing relate to d,or how does this area relateto these areas right over here?Well the important thing to realize isthis area that we have in yellow,that's going to be this area, right over here.That one's pretty clear.But how does this area in green relate to this area there?And to think about that,we just have to think about well what does an integral mean?What does it represent?We've already thought about these likethese really small rectangles.And we're taking the sum of the limit of aninfinite number of these infinitely thin rectangles.But when we're thinking about Riemann sums,we're thinking about okay we have some change in x,and then you multiply it times essentially the height,which is going to be the valueof the function at that point.Well over here, you could have the same change in x.You can have the exact same change in x.And what is the height right over here?Well, that's going to be this exact height right over here.You saw that when we constructed it.This is going to be the g of x at that value.So even though the rectangles look like they'rekinda shifted around a little bit,and they're actually all shifted up by the f of x,the heights of these rectanglesthat I'm drawing right over here,are exactly the same thing as the heightsof the rectangles that I'm drawing over here.They, once again, they're all just shifted up and downby this f of x function.But these are the exact same rectangles.And they have the exact same heights.And the limit as you get more and more of theseby making them thinner and thinner,is gonna be the same as the limit as you getmore and more of these as you get thinner and thinner.And so this area right over here,and I'm obviously not doing a rigorous proof,I'm giving you the intuition for it,is the exact same thing as this area right over here.So the area under this curve,the definite integral from a to b of f of x plus g of x, dx,is just going to be the sum of these two definite integrals.And you might say, ""Oh this is obvious"".Or maybe it's not so obvious.But when is this actually useful?Well, as you later actually learnto evaluate these integrals,you'll see that one of the most powerful ideasis being able to decompose them in this way.To say, okay, if I'm taking the definite integral fromzero to one of x squared, plus sine of x,which you may or may not have learned to do so far,you can at least start to break this down.You can say okay, well this is going to be the samething as the integral from zero to one of x squared, dx,plus the integral from zero to one of sine of x, dx.And you see this is one of the most powerfulprinciples of definite integrals, to make them,when you start to try to compute them,or even sometimes conceptualize what they're representing."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/properties-of-definite-integrals-2	khanacademy	video	:00- Do you want to evaluate the definite integralfrom three to three, of F of X, D X.And we're given the graph of F of X,and of Y equals F of X,and the area between F of X,and the X-axis over different intervals.Well when you look at this,you actually don't even have to lookat this graph over here,because in general, if I have the definite integralof any function F of X, D X,from let's say, A to the same value,from one value to the same value,this is always going to be equal to zero.We're going from three to three.We could be going from negative pi to negative pi.It's always going to be zero.One way to think about it,we're starting and stopping here at three,so we're not capturing any area.Let's do another one.So here, we want to find the definite integralfrom seven to four, of F of X, D X.So we want to go from seven to four.So we want to go from seven to four.Now you might be tempted to say,okay well look, the area between F of X and X, is two,so maybe this thing is two.But the key realization is, this area only applieswhen you have the lower bound as the lower bound,and the higher value as the higher bound.So the integral from four to sevenof F of X, D X, this thing.This thing is equal to two.This thing is depicting that area right over there.So what about this, where we've switched it?Instead of going from four to seven,we're going from seven to four.Well the key realization is, is if you switch the bounds,this is a key definite integral property,that's going to give you the negative value.So this is going to be equal to the negative of the integralfrom four to seven, of F of X, D X.And so this is going to be negative,and we just figured out the integral from four to sevenof F of X, D X, well now that is this area.F of X is above the X-axis.It's a positive area.So it is going to be,so this thing right over here is going to evaluateto positive two, but we have that negative out front,so our original expression would evaluate to negative two.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/breaking-integral-interval	khanacademy	video	":00- So we've depicted here the area underthe curve F of X above the X-axis,between the points X equals A and X equals B.And we've denote it as the definiteintegral from A to B of F of X, DX.Now what I wanna do with this video is introducea third value, C, that is in between A and B.And it could be equal to A or it could be equal to B.So let me just introduce it, right, just like that.And I could write that A is less than or equal to C,which is less than or equal to B.And what I wanna think about is, how does thisdefinite integral relate to the definite integral fromA to C and the definite integral from C to B.So let's think through that.So we have the definite integral from A to C of F of X.Actually I've already used that purple color for thefunction itself, so we use green.So we have the integral from A to C of F of X, DX,and that of course is going to, that's going torepresent this area right over here, from A to C underthe curve F of X, above the X-axis, so that's that.And then we can have the integral fromC to B of F of X, DX, and that of course isgoing to represent this area right over here.Well the one thing that probably jumps out at youis that the entire area from A to B, this entire areais just a sum of these two smaller areas.So this is just equal to that plus that over there.And once again, you might say,""Why is this integration property useful?""That if I found a C that is in this interval that's greaterthan or equal to A and it's less than or equal to B, ""Why""is it useful to be able to break up the integral this way?""Well as you'll see this is really useful, it can bevery useful when you're doing disc, when you'relooking at functions that have discontinuities,if they have step functions you can break upthe larger integral into smaller integrals.You'll also see that this is useful when we provethe fundamental theorem of Calculus.So in general, this is actually avery, very, very useful technique.Let me actually draw an integral where it might bevery useful to utilize that property.So if this is A, this is B, and let's say the function,I'm just gonna make it constant over an interval.So it's constant from there to there, and then it's,and then it drops down from there to there.Let's say the function looked like this.Well you could say that the larger integral, which would bethe area under the curve, it would be all of this.Let's just say it's a gap rightthere or it jumps down there.So this entire area you can break up into two,you can break up into two smaller areas.So you could break that up into that arearight over there, and then this area rightover here using this integral property."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/evaluating-function-defined-by-integral	khanacademy	video	:00So this right over here is the graph of the function g of t.It is a function of t, and let's define a new function.Let's call it capital G of x, and it's equal to the definiteintegral between t is equal to negative 3 and t is equal to x.Of our lowercase g of t, g of t, dt.So, given how we have just, given how we have just defined capital G of x,let's see if we can evaluate some val, let's see if we can find some values.So, let's evaluate the function capital G.At x is equal to 4, and let's also evaluatethe function capital G at x is equal to 8.And I encourage you to pause the video right now and try tothink about these on your own, and then we can work through them together.So let's tackle capital G of 4 first.So this is going to be, this is going to be, well, if x is equal to 4.This, this top boundary is going to be 4, so this is going to be the definiteintegral of g of t between t is equal to negative 3, and t is equal to 4.g of t, g of t, d t.Now what's that going to be equal to?Well, let's see, let's look at this graph here.So, we have negative 3, this t is equal to negative 3, which is right over here.T is equal to negative 3.And we're going to go all the way to is equal to 4.Let me circle that in orange.All the way to t is equal to 4 which is right over here.So this is.One way to think about this is this is going tobe the area above t-axis and below the graph of G.So, it's going to be this area, right overhere, that is above the t-axis and below the graphof G of T, but, we're not going to add to it this area because this area over here.I'll shade it in yellow.This area I'm shading in yellow over here, this is going to be negative.Why's it going to be negative?Because we want the area that is above t and below g.This is the other way around.This is below the t axis and above the graph of g.So one way to think about it is, we could split it up.So, we could, actually let me just clear this out so we have more space.So, this, right over here, is going to be equal to the integral.I'll do that in this purple color.The integral from t equals negative 3 to 0, of g of dt +.I'll do this in the other color.Plus the interval from 0, t equals 0 to t is equal to 4 of g of t, dt.Now what are each of these going to be?Well this is just a triangle where the base is 3.The base has length 3.The height is length 3.So, it's going to be 3 times 3, which is 9 times one half.Because 3 times 3 would give us the area of this entire square.But this triangle is half of that.So it's, this right over here, is going to be 4.5.This is going to be 4.5.And then, what's this area in yellow?Well, let's see, we have a triangle, it's base is, or it's width here is 4,it's height is 4, 4 times 4 is 16, which would be area of this entire square.We take half of that, it's 8.Now we don't just add it to it, because,once again, this is going to be negative area.The graph over here is below, below the T axis.So this, we would say, we would, thisintegral is going to evaluate to negative 8.Once again, why is it negative 8?Cause the graph is below, below the T axis.And so what do we get?We get g(4) which is this area essentially minus this area.4.5 minus 8 is going to be.Let's see 4 minus 8 is negative 4 out of .5 which is negative 3.5.Negative 3.5.Now let's try to figure out what g of 8 is.So g of 8.And if you couldn't figure it out the 1st time around, try to pause the video again,and now that we've figured out g of 4, try to figure what g of 8 is.Well g of 8 is, 1 way to think about it, it's going to be that.Minus that area and then we're going to add, then we're going to figureout the area and then we're going to have two more areas to think about.We're gonna go all the way to 8.So actually make, draw the line there.So we're gonna have to think about, we're going to think about this whole area now.This whole area now.And then we're gonna think about this one.So we could write this is going to be equal to the integral between.Actually let me do that purple color.So it's going to be this, this integral.Which is the integral between negative, t equals negative 3 and 0.G of t, dt.Plus this entire yellow region right now.The part that we looked at before plus this part over here.So, I'll just write that as, plus the definated role between t is equal to 0and 6 of g of t dt.And then finally.Plus the definite integral between T is equal to 6 and T is equal to 8 g(t) dt.Now we already know that this first one evaluates to 4.5, so that one is 4.5.Now what's this one going to be?We have a triangle.Whose base is length 6, height is 4, 6 times4 is 24 times one half is going to get us 12.So this is going to be, that over there is twelve and then finally what is this area?Oh and we have to be careful.This is below the t axis and above the graph.So this is going to be a negative 12.And then finally, we have this area, which is once again going to be a positive area.It's below the graph and above the t axis.And so let's see, 2 times 4 is 8 times 0.5 is 4.So we're going to have.Plus 4.Plus 4.And so what do we have?We end up with 4.5 plus 4 is 8.5 minus 12.So this is going to be equal to.This is going to be equal to 8.8 minus 12 would be negative 4 plus 5.It is negative 3.5 again.Now why did these two things end up being the same?Well think about what happened here.When we went from capital G of 4 to capital G of 8.We subtracted, we subtracted this value right over here and we added thisvalue right over here and you see that these two triangles have the same areas.So we subtracted and added the same amount to get the same exact value.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/merging-definite-integrals-over-adjacent-intervals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we have hereis a graph of y is equal to f of x,and these numbers are the areas of these shaded regions,these regions between our curve and the x-axis.What we're going to do in this video is do some examplesof evaluating definite integrals using this informationand some knowledge of definite integral properties.So let's start with an example.Let's say we want to evaluate the definite integralgoing from negative four to negative two of f of xd of x plus the definite integral going fromnegative two to zero of f of x dx.Pause this video, and see if you canevaluate this entire expression.So this first part of our expression,the definite integral from negative fourto negative two of f of x dx,we're going from x equals negative fourto x equals negative two.And so this would evaluate asthis areabetween our curve and our x-axis,but it would be the negative of that areabecause our curve is below the x-axis.And we could try to estimate itbased on the information they've given us,but they haven't given us exactly that value.But we also need to figure out this right over here.And here we're going from x equals negative two to zeroof f of x d of x, so that's going to be this area.So if you're looking at the sum of thesetwo definite integrals, and notice the upper bound hereis the lower bound here, you're really thinking about,this is really going to be the same thing as,this is equal to the definite integralgoing from x equals negative fourall the way to x equals zero of f of x dx.And this is indeed one of our integration properties.If our upper bound here is the same as our lower bound hereand we are integrating the same thing,well, then you can merge these twodefinite integrals in this way.And this is just going to be this entire area.But because we are below the x-axisand above our curve here,it would be the negative of that area.So this is going to be equal to negative seven.Let's do another example.Let's say someone were to ask you,walk up you on the street and say, quick,here's a graph, what is the value of the expressionthat I'm about to write down,the definite integral going from zero to four of f of x dxplus the definite integral going from four to sixof f of x dx?Pause this video, and see if you can figure that out.Well, once again, this first part right over here,going from zero to four,so what would be is it would be this area.It would be this five right over here,but then we would need to subtract this areabecause this area is below our x-axis and above our curve.We don't know exactly what this is.But luckily we also need,we need to take the sum of everything I just showed,but plus,plus this right over here.And this, we're going from four to six,so it's going to be this area.Well, once again, when you look at it this way,you can see that this expressionis going to be equivalent to taking the definite integralall the way from zero to six,zero to six of f of x dx.And once again, even if you didn't see the graph,you would know that because, in both cases,you're getting the definite integral of f of x dx.And our upper bound here is our lower bound here.So once again, we're able to merge the integrals.And what is this going to be equal to?Well, we have this area here, which is five.And then we have this area, which is six.That was given to us.But since it's below the x-axis and above our curve,when we evaluate it as a definite integral,it would evaluate as a negative six.So this is going to be five plus negative six,which is equal to negative one.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/evaluating-function-defined-by-integral-switch	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] The graph of f is shown below.Let g(x) be equal to the def intergralfrom zero to x, of f(t)dt.Now at first when you see this you're like,wow this is strange, I have a functionthat is being defined by an integral,a def integral, but one of it's bounds are X.You should just say well this is okay,a function can be defined any which way,and as we'll see, it's actually quite straight forwardto evaluate this.So g of negative two,g of negative two,and I'll do the negative two in a different color,g of negative two,what we do is take this expression over here,this def integral, and where ever we see an X,we replace it with a negative two.So this is going to be equal to,the integral from zero to X,and I'll write X in a second, f(t)dt.Well X is now negative two, this is now negative two.So how do we figure out what this is?Before we even look at this graph,you might say okay this is the region under,the area of the region under the graph,y equals f(t), between negative two and zero.But you have to be careful, notice,our upper bound here is actually a lower numberthan our lower bound right over here.So it will be nice to swap those boundsso we can truly view it as the area of the regionunder f(t), above the t axis, between those two bounds.When you swap the bounds, this is going to be equal tonegative def integral,from negative two,negative two to zero,of f(t)dt,and now what we have right over here,what I'm squaring off in magenta,this is the area under the curve f,between negative two and zero.So between negative two and zero,so that is this area,right over here, that we care about.Now what is that going to be?There's a bunch of different ways that you could do this,you could split it off into a square and triangle.The area of this square here is four,it's two by two, make sure to look at the units,sometimes each square doesn't represent one square unit,in this case it does, so that's four,and then up here, this is half of four.If it was all of this, that would be four,this triangle is half of four, so this is two.Or you could view this as base times height times one half,which is going to be two times two times one half.So this area is six, so this part is six,but we can't forget that negative sign,so this is going to be equal to negative six.So g(-2) is negative six.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/swapping-the-bounds-for-definite-integral	khanacademy	video	:00We want to find the derivative with respectto x of all of this business right over here.And you might guess-- and this is definitely a function of x.x is one of the boundaries of integrationfor this definite integral.And you might say, well, it lookslike the fundamental theorem of calculus might apply,but I'm used to seeing the x, or the functionx, as the upper bound, not as the lower bound.How do I deal with this?And the key realization is to realizewhat happens when you switch bounds for a definite integral.And I'll do a little bit of an aside to review that.So if I'm taking the definite integral from a to b of f of t,dt, we know that this is capital F, the antiderivative of f,evaluated at b minus the antiderivative of F evaluatedat a.This is corollary to the fundamental theorem,or it's the fundamental theorem part two,or the second fundamental theorem of calculus.This is how we evaluate definite integrals.Now, let's think about what the negative of this is.So the negative of that-- of a to b of f of t,dt, is just going to be equal to the negative of this, whichis equal to-- so it's the negative of f of b minus fof a, which is equal to capital F of a minus capital F of b.All I did is distribute the negative signand then switch the two terms.But this right over here is equal to the definite integralfrom, instead of a to b, but from b to a of f of t, dt.So notice, when you put a negative,that's just like switching the signsor switching the boundaries.Or if you switch the boundaries, theyare the negatives of each other.So we can go back to our original problem.We can rewrite this as being equal to the derivative withrespect to x of-- instead of this,it'll be the negative of the same definite integral but withthe boundaries switched-- the negative of x with the upperboundary is x, the lower bound is 3 of the square rootof the absolute value of cosine t, dt,which is equal to--we can take the negative out front--negative times the derivative with respect to x of allof this business.I should just copy and paste that,so I'll just copy and paste.Let me-- and paste it.So times the derivative with respect to x of all that,and now the fundamental theorem of calculus directly applies.This is going to be equal to-- we deserve a drum roll now.This is going to be equal to the negative--can't forget the negative.And the fundamental theorem of calculustells us that that's just going to bethis function as a function of x.So it's going to be negative square rootof the absolute value of cosine of not t anymore, but x.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/both-bounds-being-a-function-of-x	khanacademy	video	:00So let's see if we can take the derivative of this expressionright over here, if we can find capital F prime of x.And once again, it looks like youmight be able to use the fundamental theoremof calculus.A big giveaway is that you're takingthe derivative of a definite integral thatgives you a function of x.But here I have x on both the upper and the lower boundary,and the fundamental theorem of calculus,is at least from what we've seen,is when we have x's only on the upper boundary.And then, of course, it's an x squared,but we've seen examples of that alreadywhen we used the chain rule to do it.But how can we break this up and putthis in a form that's a little bit closer to what we'refamiliar with when we apply the fundamental theoremof calculus?And to realize that, we really justhave to attempt to graph what this is representing.So let's say that this is our lowercasef of x, or I should say f of t.So let's call this lowercase f of t.And let's graph it over the intervalbetween x and x squared.So let's say this is my y-axis.This is my t-axis.And let's say that this right over hereis y is equal to f of t.I'm drawing it generally.I don't know what this exactly looks like.And we're going to talk about the intervalbetween x and x squared.So if we're going to talk about the interval between x, whichis right over here, it's the lower bound,so x and x squared.It's the lower bound, at least for this definite integral.We don't know for sure.It depends on what x you choose on which one is actuallysmaller.But let's just say that for the sake of visualizing,we'll draw x right over here, and wewill draw x squared right over here.So this whole expression, this entire definite integral,is essentially asking for, is essentially representingthis entire area, the entire area under the curve.But what we could do is introduce a constantthat's someplace in between x and x squared.Let's say that constant is c, and break this areainto two different areas with c as the divider.So that same exact whole area we can nowwrite it as two separate integrals.So one integral that represents this area right overhere, and then another integral that represents this arearight over there, and where we justsay c is some constant between x and x squared.Well, how can we denote this area in purple?Well, that's going to be-- So this thing is goingto be equal to the sum of these two areas.The purple area we can show is the definite integralfrom x to c of our function of t, cosine t over t dt.And then to that we're going to add the green area.And then we'll get the original area.So for the green area, our lower bound of integrationis now our constant c, and our upper bound of integrationis x squared, and it's going to be of cosine t over t dt.And this is a form where, if we know how to apply the chainrule, we can apply the fundamental theoremof calculus.And this is almost in a form.We're used to seeing it where the x is the upper bound.And, well, we already know what happens.We can swap these two bounds, but it'll justbe the negative of that integral.So this is going to be equal to-- let me rewrite it--the negative of the definite integral from cto x of cosine t over t dt.And then we have plus the definite integralthat goes from c to x squared of cosine t over t dt.So all we've done is we've rewritten this thing in a waythat we're used to applying the fundamental theoremof calculus.So if we want to find F prime of x, well,applying the derivative operator over here,we're going to have a negative out front.It's going to be equal to negative cosine x over x.Once again, just the fundamental theorem of calculus.And then plus-- we're first goingto take the derivative of this thing with respectto x squared, and that's going to give youcosine of x squared over x squared.Wherever you saw t, you replace it with an x squared.And then you're going to multiply that timesthe derivative of x squared with respect to x.So that's just going to be-- derivativeof x squared with respect to x is just 2x.And we're done.We just need to simplify this thing.So all of this is going to be equal to negative cosinex over x plus-- well, this is going to cancel outwith just one of those-- plus 2 cosine x squared over x.And I guess we could simplify it even more as being equal to--and we can swap these-- everything over x 2 cosineof x squared minus cosine of x.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-properties-of-definite-integrals/v/integral-defined-function-0	khanacademy	video	:00So right over here we have the graph of the function f.And we're assuming that f is a function of t, our horizontal axis.Here's the t-axis.So that is f of t, lowercase f of t.And now let's just, let's define another function.Let's call it capital F of, and it's not going to be a function of t.It's going to be a function of x.So capital F of x is equal to.We're gonna definite it as the definite integral between tis equal to negative 5 and t is equal to x.Actually let me make those x's in the same color so they really stand out.So f of x is equal to the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5and t is equal to x of f of t, f of t dt.And if I had my druthers I'd probably wouldn't use capital f and lower case f,I would use like a g or capital G just so that when I say F, you don't get confused.Well I'm gonna try my best to say lower-case F of t, capital F of x.So this is how we're gonna define the function capital F of x.Definite integral between t is equal to negative 5, and x of f of t, dt.Now given this definition.What I wanna think about is at what x values doescapital F of x, does capital F of x equal 0?So we'll write that down.At what x valuesdoes, this is, is this, I guess you could say, this equation, atwhat x values is this equation true?And I encourage you to pause this video rightnow and try to think about it on your own.And then we can work through it together.So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's just thinkabout what this, what this function capital F of x is really talking about.Well it's the one way to think about itis it's the area below, between negative 5, between tequals negative 5 and t equals x, that is belowthe function f of t and above the t axis.And if the areas is the other way around, if it's belowthe t axis and above the function, it's gonna be negative area.So we're looking at t equals negative 5, whichis this, you could say this boundary right over here.That is t is equal to negative 5.And if you put, pick an x value, let's just say x were negative2, so if that is your x value right over here, capital F woulddescribe, would describe this area, this area it would be anegative area because here the function is below the t axis.So, for example capital F of negative 2 would be negative.Now, what x values makes this a 0?So one might jump out at you.Well, if we just, if we made, if we put x, if we put x right at negative 5.Right at negative 5.Then there's no width, width here.There's not going to be any area.So f of, f of negative 5.F of negative 5, F of negative capital F of negative 5, I should be clear here.Capital F of negative 5, which is equal to the definite integral between t is equalto negative 5 and t is equal to negative 5, of f of t dt.F of t dt.Well you have the, you have the, you, you have the same boundaries here.So this is going to be 0, once again this area you have no width to this area.So this is going to be equal to 0.So, we can list x equals negative 5 as being one of the points.One of the x values that makes capital F of x equal 0.But let's see if we can find more of them.Let's see if we were to go, let me erase this right over here.So, this was.We're starting at t equals negative 5.Now as x gets larger and larger and larger,when x is equal to negative 3, our area.So, let's see this area right over here, this area right over here is going to be,so that is, I see that we have, it's 2, we're going from negative 5 to negative 3.So the distance right over here is two.This height, right over here, is 4.So, this area, right over here, is 2 times 4 times 1/2, which is going to be 4.And, since it's above the function and below the t-axis, we'llwrite this as a negative, we'll write that as a negative 4.And now, so let's see, so we're starting when x is equal to 5.Uf, capital F of x is equal to 0, that is you get further andfurther out, you're getting more and morenegative values, that's more and more negative values.But I just picked out this point right over here because thisseems like a point of transition of the function, and then we have.This region, which is just going to add more negative area tocapital F of x as x gets larger and larger and larger.And this looks like a really, a quarter circle.This is, it has a quarter circle of radius 4, and now wehave another quarter circle of radius 4 until we get to x equals 5.And this is actually going to be positive area.Because here our function is above the t axis.So when we've gotten this far, so all, the way I'm thinking about it, myx is, my x, when capital F of x equal negative 5 is, is 0.And now our area, as x becomes larger andlarger, and larger, our area becomes negative, negative, negative, negative.Now it becomes less negative, because we'restarting to add, we're starting to add.So, for example, if x is equal to 2, if xis equal to 2, we would be looking at this positive.But we still have all this huge negative area to overcome.So we're still in negative territory.But the more positive we add, we're gonna become less negative.And you go all the way to xequals positive 5 and this positive area, this quartercircle right over here of positive area, is goingto exactly offset this quarter circle of negative area.You don't even have to think about what that area is, althoughyou can obviously figure it out with pi R squared and whatever else.And so now we just have to keepadding more positive area to offset this negative 4.So how do we do that?Well the height here, the height right over here is 4, the height right overhere is 4 so if we, if we can add our rectangle that is one wide and 4 high.That's positive area of 4, which this has right over here.So this is plus 4.Is going to offset this negative 4.So we go all the way to x is equal to 6.When x is equal to 6, capital F of x is going to be equal to 0.Let's write that down.So capital F.Capital f of, capital f of positive 6, of positive6, which is going to be equal to the definiteintegral between negative 5 and positive 6.Positive 6 of f of t.F of t, dt, well we can break this up.We already went through it, I'm just gonna, going tomake sure that we really understood what was going on.This is equal to, and I'll just to it all in one color now.This is equal to, actually I'll do it in these colors that I did here.This is equal to the integral.The integral between negative 5and negative 3 of f of t, dt, plusthe integral, plus the integralbetween negative 3 and 1 of f of t dt.Plus the integral between 1 and 5 of f of t, dt.That describes this right over here.And then finally, plus, plusthe definite integral between 5 and 6 of f of t, dt.f of t, dt.And, this describes this negative area.This describes this positive area.These two net out to be 0.And then this area we already figured out, is.Or this definite integral I should say is negative 4.This is negative 4 and this one right over here is positive 4 and so theynet out and this of course is equal to 0 which we wanted to figure out.Once again how did I do that?Well I said okay clearly when x is equal to negative 5 you have no area and then ijust kept increasing, kept increasing xs to larger andlarger values, I could have gone actually the other way.And, I would have had just more and more positive values therewould have been nothing to offset it to get us back to 0.But, as we increased x above negative 5, thecapital Fof x; the area, is more and moreand more negative, but then it becomes, then westart adding positive value to it to offset the negative.And, we fully offset the negative at x is equal to 6.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-and-definite-integrals/v/antiderivatives-and-indefinite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00We know how to take derivatives of functions.If I apply the derivative operator to x squared,I get 2x.Now, if I also apply the derivative operatorto x squared plus 1, I also get 2x.If I apply the derivative operator to x squared plus pi,I also get 2x.The derivative of x squared is 2x.Derivative, with respect to x of pi of a constant, is just 0.Derivative, with respect to x of 1,is just a constant, is just 0.So once again, this is just going to be equal to 2x.In general, the derivative, with respectto x of x squared plus any constant,is going to be equal to 2x.The derivative of x squared, with respect to x, is 2x.Derivative of a constant, with respect to x,a constant does not change with respectto x, so it's just equal to 0.So you have-- You apply the derivative operatorto any of these expressions and you get 2x.Now, let's go the other way around.Let's think about the antiderivative.And one way to think about it is we'redoing the opposite of the derivative operator.The derivative operator, you get an expressionand you find it's derivative.Now, what we want to do, is given some expression,we want to find what it could be the derivative of.So if someone were to tell-- or giveyou 2x-- if someone were to say 2x-- let me write this.So if someone were to ask you what is 2x the derivative of?They're essentially asking you for the antiderivative.And so you could say, well, 2x is the derivative of x squared.But you could also say 2x is the derivative of x squared plus 1.You could also say that 2x is the derivative of x squaredplus pi, I think you get the general idea.So if you wanted to write it in the most general sense,you would write that 2x is the derivativeof x squared plus some constant.So this is what you would considerthe antiderivative of 2x.Now, that's all nice, but this iskind of clumsy to have to write a sentence like this, so let'scome up with some notation for the antiderivative.And the convention here is to usekind of a strange looking notation, isto use a big elongated s looking thing like that,and a dx around the function that you'retrying to take the antiderivative of.So in this case, it would look something like this.This is just saying this is equal to the antiderivativeof 2x, and the antiderivative of 2x, we have already seen,is x squared plus c.Now, you might be saying, why do weuse this type of crazy notation.It'll become more obvious when we study the definite integraland areas under curves and taking sums of rectanglesin order to approximate the area of the curve.Here, it really should just be viewedas a notation for antiderivative.And this notation right over here, this whole expression,is called the indefinite integralof 2x, which is another way of just sayingthe antiderivative of 2x.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-reverse-power-rule/v/indefinite-integrals-of-x-raised-to-a-power	khanacademy	video	:00Let's take the derivative with respectto x of x to the n plus 1-th power over nplus 1 plus some constant c.And we're going to assume here, because wewant this expression to be defined,we're going to assume that n does not equal negative 1.If it equaled negative 1, we'd be dividing by 0,and we haven't defined what that means.So let's take the derivative here.So this is going to be equal to-- well, the derivative of xto the n plus 1 over n plus 1, wecan just use the power rule over here.So our exponent is n plus 1.We can bring it out front.So it's going to be n plus 1 times x to the-- Iwant to use that same color.Colors are the hard part-- times x to the-- instead of nplus 1, we subtract 1 from the exponent.This is just the power rule.So n plus 1 minus 1 is going to be n.And then we can't forget that we were dividing by this n plus 1.So we have divided by n plus 1.And then we have plus c.The derivative of a constant with respect to x-- a constantdoes not change as x changes, so it is justgoing to be 0, so plus 0.And since n is not equal to negative 1,we know that this is going to be defined.This is just going to be something dividedby itself, which is just going to be 1.And this whole thing simplifies to x to the n.So the derivative of this thing-- and thisis a very general terms-- is equal to x to the n.So given that, what is the antiderivative-- letme switch colors here.What is the antiderivative of x to the n?And remember, this is just the kindof strange-looking notation we use.It'll make more sense when we start doing definite integrals.But what is the antiderivative of x to the n?And we could say the antiderivative with respectto x, if we want to.And another way of calling this is the indefinite integral.Well, we know this is saying x to the nis the derivative of what?Well, we just figured it out.It's the derivative of this thing,and we've written it in very general terms.We're actually encapsulating multiple constants here.We could have x to the n plus 1 over nplus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus 2, plus pi, plus a billion.So this is going to be equal to x to the n plus 1 over nplus 1 plus c.So this is pretty powerful.You can kind of view this as the reverse power rule.And it applies for any n, as longas n does not equal negative 1.Let me make that very clear.n does not equal negative 1.Once again, this thing would be undefinedif n were equal to negative 1.So let's do a couple of examples justto apply this-- you could call it the reverse powerrule if you want, or the anti-power rule.So let's take the antiderivative of x to the fifth power.What is the antiderivative of x to the fifth?Well, all we have to say is, well, look,the 5 is equal to the n.We just have to increment the exponent by 1.So this is going to be equal to x to the 5 plus 1 power.And then we divide by that same value.Whatever the exponent was when you increment it by 1,we divide by that same value, divided by 5 plus 1.And of course, we want to encapsulateall of the possible antiderivatives,so you put the c right over there.So this is going to be equal to x to the sixth over 6 plus c.And you can verify.Take the derivative of this using the power rule,you indeed get x to the fifth.Let's try another one.Let's try-- now we'll do it in blue.Let's try the antiderivative of-- let's make it interesting.Let's make it 5 times x to the negative 2 power dx.So how would we evaluate this?Well, one simplification you can do--and I haven't rigorously proven it to you just yet--but we know that scalars can go in and outof the derivative operator when you're multiplying by a scalar.So this is, indeed, equal to 5 times the antiderivativeof x to the negative 2 power, dx.And now we can just use, I guess we could call itthis anti-power rule, so this is goingto be equal to 5 times x to the negative 2 power plus 1over the negative 2 power plus 1 plus some constant rightover here.And then we can rewrite this as 5 times negative 2 power plus 1is x to the negative 1 over negative 2 plus 1is negative 1, plus some constant.And this is equal to 5 times negative x to the negative 1plus some constant.And then if we want, we can distribute the 5.So this is equal to negative 5x to the negative 1.Now, we could write plus 5 times some constant,but this is just an arbitrary constant.So this is still just an arbitrary constant.So maybe we could [INAUDIBLE] this.If you want it to show that it's a different constant,you could say this is c1, c1, c1.You multiply 5 times c1, you get another constant.We could just call that c, which is equal to 5 times c1.But there you have it.Negative 5x to the negative 1 plus c.And once again, all of these, try to evaluate the derivative,and you will see that you get this business, right overthere.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-reverse-power-rule/v/indefinite-integral-properties	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So we have listed hereare two significant properties of indefinite integrals.And we will see in the futurethat they are very, very powerful.All this is saying is the indefinite integralof the sum of two different functionsis equal to the sum of the indefinite integralof each of those functions.This one right over here says the indefinite integralof a constant, that's not gonna be a function of x,of a constant times f of x is the same thingas the constant times the indefinite integral of f of x.So one way to think about it iswe took the constant out of the integral,which we'll see in the future,both of these are very useful techniques.Now, if you're satisfied with them as they are written,then that's fine, you can move on.If you want a little bit of a proof,What I'm going to do here to give an argumentfor why this is true is use the derivative properties.Take the derivative of both sidesand see that the equality holdsonce we get rid of the integrals.So let's do that.Let's take the derivative with respect to xof both sides of this.Derivative with respect to x.The left side here, well, this will just becomewhatever's inside the indefinite integral.This will just become f of xplus g of xplus g of x.Now what would this become?Well, we could just go to our derivative properties.The derivative of the sum of two things,that's just the same thing as the sum of the derivatives.So this'll be a little bit lengthy.So this is going to be the derivative with respect to xof this first part plus the derivative with respect to xof this second part.So this first part is the integral of f of x dx,we're gonna add it.And this is the integral of g of x dx.So let met write it down.This is f of x and then this is g of x.Now, what are these things?Well, these things, let me just write this equal signright over here.So then this is going to be equal tothe derivative of this with respect to xis just going to be f of x.And then the derivative with respect to hereis just going to be g of x.And this is obviously true.So now let's tackle this.Well, let's just do the same thing.Let's take the derivative of both sides.So the derivative with respect to x of thatand the derivative with respect to x of that.So the left-hand side will clearly become c times f of x.The right-hand side is going to become,well, we know from our derivative properties,the derivative of a constant times somethingis the same thing as the constant times the derivativeof that something.So then we have the integral,indefinite integral of f of x dx.And then this thing is just going to be f of x.So this is all going to be equal to c times f of x.So once again, you can see that the equality clearly holds.So hopefully this makes you feel goodthat those properties are true.But the more important thing is you know when to use it.So, for example, if I were to take the integral of,let's say, x squared pluscosine of x, the indefinite integral of that,we now know it's going to be useful in the future.Say, well, this is the same thingas the integral of x squared dxplus the integral of cosine of x dx.So this is the same thing as that plus that.Then you can separately evaluate them.And this is helpful, because we know that if we are tryingto figure out the integral of,let's say, pi timessine of x dx,then we can take this constant out.Pi is in no way dependent on x,it's just going to stay be equal to pi.So we can take it out and that is going to be equalto pi times the integral of sine of x.Two very useful properties,and hopefully you feel a lot better about them both now.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-reverse-power-rule/v/rewriting-integrand-before-integrating	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's say that we wanted to takethe indefinite integral of X squaredtimes three X minus one DX.Pause this video and see if you can evaluate this.So, you might be saying oh, what kind of fancy techniquecould I use?But you will see sometimes the fanciestor maybe the least fancy but the best techniqueis to just simplify this algebraically.So, in this situation what would happensif we distribute this X squared?Well, then we're going to get a polynomial herewithin the integral,so this is going to be equal to the integralof X squared times three Xis three X to the thirdand then negative one times X squared is minus X squaredand then that times DXand now this is pretty straightforward to evaluate.This is going to be equal to the anti-derivativeof X to the third is X to the fourth over fourso this is going to be three times X to the fourthover four, I could write it that wayor let me just write it X to the fourth over fourand then the anti-derivative of X squaredis X to the third over three,so minus X to the third over threeand this is an indefinite integral,there might be a constant there,so let me write that down and we're done.The big takeaway is you just have to doa little bit of distribution to get a formwhere it's easier to evaluate the anti-derivative.Let's do another example.Let's say that we want to takethe indefinite integral of,this is gonna be a hairy expression,so X to the third plus three X squared minus five,all of that over X squared DX.What would this be?Pause the video againand see if you can figure it out.So, once again your brain might want to try to dosome fancy tricks or whatever elsebut the main insight hereis to realize that you could just simplify it algebraically.What happens if you just divide each of these termsby X squared?Well, then this thing is going to be equal to,that's in parentheses here,X to the third divided by X squaredis just going to be X.Three X squared divided by X squaredis just threeand then negative five divided by X squared,you could just write that as negative fivetimes X to the negative two power.And so, once again we just need to usethe reverse power rule hereto take the anti-derivative.This is going to be,let's see the anti-derivative of Xis X squared over two,X squared over two plus the anti-derivative of threewould just be three X.The anti-derivative of negative five Xto the negative two.So, we would increment the exponent by one,positive one and then divide by that value.So, it would be negative five X to the negative one,we're adding one to the negative one,all of that divided by negative onewhich is the same,we could write it like that.Well, these two would just,you would have minusand then you're dividing by negative one,so it's really just going,we can rewrite it like this plus five X to the negative oneand you could take the derivative of thisto verify that it would indeed give you thatand of course we can't forget our plus C,never forget thatif you're taking an indefinite integral.Alright, let's just do one more for good measure.Let's say we're taking the indefinite integralof the cube root of X to the fifth DX.Pause the video and see if you can evaluate this.Try to write it a little bit neater.X to the fifth DX.Pause the video and try to figure it out.So, here the realization is well,if you just rewrite all this as one exponent,so this is equal to the indefinite integralof X to the fifth to the one third,I just rewrote the cube rootas the one third power DX,which is the same thing as the integralof X to the, if I raise something to a powerand then raise that to a powerI can multiply those two exponents,that's just exponent properties,X to the five thirds DX,many of you might have just gone straight to this stepright over hereand then once again,we just have to use the reverse power rule.This is going to be X to the,we increment this five thirds by oneor we can add three thirds to it,so it's X to the eight thirdsand then we divide by eight thirdsor multiply by its reciprocalso we could just say three eighthstimes X to the eight thirdsand of course, we have our plus C and verify this.If you use the power rule hereyou'd have eight thirds times the three eights,will just give you a coefficient of oneand then you decrement this by three thirds or one,you get to five thirdswhich is exactly what we originally had.So, the big takeaway of this video,many times the most powerful integration techniqueis literally just algebraic simplification first.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-indefinite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/antiderivative-of-x-1	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video isthink about the antiderivative of 1/x.Or another way of thinking about it, another way of writing it ,is the antiderivative of x to the negative 1 power.And we already know, if we somehowtry to apply that anti-power rule,that inverse power rule over here,we would get something that's not defined.We would get x to the 0 over 0, doesn't make any sense.And you might have been saying, OK, well, Iknow what to do in this case.When we first learned about derivatives,we know that the derivative-- letme do this in yellow-- the derivative with respectto x of the natural log of x is equal to 1 over x.So why can't we just say that the antiderivativeof this right over here is equal to the natural log of x plus c?And this isn't necessarily wrong.The problem here is that it's not broad enough.When I say it's not broad enough,is that the domain over here, for our original functionthat we're taking the antiderivative of,is all real numbers except for x equals 0.So over here, x cannot be equal to 0.While the domain over here is only positive numbers.So over here, x, so for this expression,x has to be greater than 0.So it would be nice if we could come upwith an antiderivative that has the same domain as the functionthat we're taking the antiderivative of.So it would be nice if we could find an antiderivative thatis defined everywhere that our original function is.So pretty much everywhere except for x equaling 0.So how can we rearrange this a little bitso that it could be defined for negative values as well?Well, one one possibility is to thinkabout the natural log of the absolute value of x.So I'll put little question mark here,just because we don't really knowwhat the derivative of this thing is going to be.And I'm not going to rigorously prove it here,but I'll I will give you kind of the conceptual understanding.So to understand it, let's plot the natural log of x.And I had done this ahead of time.So that right over there is roughlywhat the graph of the natural log of x looks like.So what would the natural log of the absolute valueof x is going to look like?Well, for positive x's, it's going to look just like this.For positive x's you take the absolute value of it,it's just the same thing as taking that original value.So it's going to look just like that for positive x's.But now this is also going to be defined for negative x's.If you're taking the absolute value of negative 1,that evaluates to just 1.So it's the natural log of 1, so you're going to be right there.As you get closer and closer and closer to 0from the negative side, you're justgoing to take the absolute value.So it's essentially going to be exactly this curvefor the natural log of x, but the left sideof the natural log of the absolute value of xis going to be its mirror image, if you were to reflect aroundthe y-axis.It's going to look something like this.So what's nice about this functionis you see it's defined everywhere, except for-- I'mtrying to draw it as symmetrically as possible--except for x equals 0.So if you combine this pink part and this part on the right,if you combine both of these, youget y is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of x.Now let's think about its derivative.Well, we already know what the derivative of the natural logof x is, and for positive values of x.So let me write this down.For x is greater than 0, we get the natural logof the absolute value of x is equal to the natural log of x.Let me write this.Is equal to the natural log of x.And we would also know, since these two areequal for x is greater than 0, the derivativeof the natural log of the absolute value of xis going to be equal to the derivative of the natural logof x.Which is equal to 1/x for x greater than 0.So let's plot that.I'll do that in green.It's equal to 1/x.So 1/x, we've seen it before.It looks something like this.So let me do my best attempt to draw it.It has both vertical and horizontal asymptotes.So it looks something like this.So this right over here is 1/x x is greater than 0.So this is 1/x when x is greater than 0.So all it's saying here, and you can see pretty clearly,is the slope right over here, the slope of the tangent lineis 1.And so you see that when you lookat the derivative, the slope right over here,the derivative should be equal to 1 here.When you get close to 0, you havea very, very steep positive slope here.And so you see you have a very high value for its derivative.And then as you move away from 0, it's still steep.But it becomes less and less and less steepall the way until you get to 1.And then it keeps getting less and less and less steep.But it never quite gets to absolutely flat slope.And that's what you see its derivative doing.Now what is the natural log of absolute valueof x doing right over here?When we are out here, our slope is very close to 0.It's symmetric.The slope here is essentially the negative of the slope here.I could do it maybe clearer, showing it right here.Whatever the slope is right over here,it's the exact negative of whateverthe slope is at a symmetric point on the other side.So if on the other side, the slope is right over here,over here it's going to be the negative of that.So it's going to be right over there.And then the slope it just gets more and more and morenegative.Right over here, the slope is a positive 1.Over here it's going to be a negative 1.So right over here our slope is a negative 1.And then as we get closer and closer to 0,it's just going to get more and more and more negative.So the derivative of the natural logof the absolute value of x, for x is less than 0,looks something like this.And you see, and once again, it'snot a ultra rigorous proof, but whatyou see is that the derivative of the natural logof the absolute value of x is equal to 1/x for allx's not equaling 0.So what you're seeing, or hopefully youcan visualize, that the derivative-- letme write it this way-- of the natural logof the absolute value of x is indeed equal to 1/x for allx does not equal 0.So this is a much more satisfying antiderivativefor 1/x.It has the exact the same domain.So when we think about what the antiderivative is for 1/x--and I didn't do a kind of a rigorous proof here,I didn't use the definition of the derivative and all of that.But I kind of gave you a visual understanding, hopefully,of it.We would say it's the natural logof the absolute value of x plus c.And now we have an antiderivativethat has the same domain as that functionthat we're taking the antiderivative of.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-indefinite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/basic-trig-and-exponential-antiderivatives	khanacademy	video	:00I thought I would do a few more examplesof taking antiderivatives, just so we feel comfortable takingantiderivatives of all of the basic functionsthat we know how to take the derivatives of.And on top of that, I just want to make it clearthat it doesn't always have to be functions of x.Here we have a function of t, and we'retaking the antiderivative with respect to t.And so you would not write a dx here.That is not the notation.You'll see why when we focus on definite integrals.So what's the antiderivative of this business right over here?Well, it's going to be the same thing as the antiderivativeof sine of t, or the indefinite integral of sine of t,plus the indefinite integral, or the antiderivative,of cosine of t.So let's think about what these antiderivatives are.And we already know a little bit about takingthe derivatives of trig functions.We know that the derivative with respect to t of cosine of tis equal to negative sine of t.So if we want a sine of t here, wewould just have to take the derivative of negative cosinet.If we take the derivative of negative cosine t,then we get positive sine of t.The derivative with respect to t of cosine tis negative sine of t.We have the negative out front.It becomes positive sine of t.So the antiderivative of sine of t is negative cosine of t.So this is going to be equal to negative cosine of t.And then what's the antiderivative of cosine of t?Well, we already know that the derivative with respectto t of sine of t is equal to cosine of t.So cosine of t's antiderivative is justsine of t-- so plus sine of t.And we're done.We've found the antiderivative.Now let's tackle this.Now we don't have a t.We're taking the indefinite integral with respectto-- actually, this is a mistake.This should be with respect to a.Let me clean this up.This should be a da.If we were taking this with respect to t,then we would treat all of these things as just constants.But I don't want to confuse you right now.Let me make it clear.This is going to be da.That's what we are integrating or takingthe antiderivative with respect to.So what is this going to be equal to?Well once again, we can rewrite it as the sum of integrals.This is the indefinite integral of e to the a da,so this one right over here-- a dI'll do it in green-- plus the indefinite integral,or the antiderivative, of 1/a da.Now, what is the antiderivative of e to the a?Well, we already know a little bit about exponentials.The derivative with respect to x of e to the xis equal to e to the x.That's one of the reasons why e in the exponential functionin general is so amazing.And if we just replaced a with x or x with a,you get the derivative with respect to a of e to the ais equal to e to the a.So the antiderivative here, the derivative of eto the a, the antiderivative is going to be e to the a.And maybe you can shift it by some type of a constant.Oh, and let me not forget, I haveto put my constant right over here.I could have a constant factor.So let me-- always important.Remember the constant.So you have a constant factor right over here.Never forget that.I almost did.So once again, over here, what's the antiderivative of eto the a?It is e to the a.What's the antiderivative of 1/a?Well, we've seen that in the last video.It is going to be the natural log of the absolute value of a.And then we want to have the most general antiderivative,so there could be a constant factor out here as well.And we are done.We found the antiderivative of both of these expressions.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/reverse-power-rule-for-definite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Let's evaluate the definite integralfrom negative three to fiveof four dx.What is this going to be equal to?And I encourage you to pause the videoand try to figure it out on your own.All right, so in order to evaluate this,we need to remember the fundamental theorem of calculus,which connects the notionof a definite integral and antiderivative.So the fundamental theorem of calculus tells usthat our definite integral from a to b of f of x dxis going to be equal to the antiderivativeof our function f, which we denote with the capital F,evaluated at the upper bound,minusour antiderivative,evaluated at the lower bound.So we just have to do that right over here.So this is going to be equal to,well, what is the antiderivative of four?Well, you might immediately say,well, that's just going to be four x.You could even think of it in terms of reverse power rule.Four is the same thing as four x to the zero.So you increase zero by one.So it's going to be four x to the first,and then you divide by that new exponent.Four x to the first divided by one,well, that's just going to be four x.So the antiderivative is four x.This is, you could say, our capital F of x,and we're going to evaluate thatat five and at negative three.We're gonna find the difference between these two.So what we have right over here,evaluating the antiderivative at our upper bound,that is going to be four times five.And then from that, we're going to subtract,evaluating our antiderivative at the lower bound.So that's four times negative three.Four times negative three.And what is that going to be equal to?So this is20 and then minus negative 12.So this is going to be plus 12,which is going to be equal to 32.Let's do another examplewhere we're going to do the reverse power rule.So let's saythat we want to findthe indefinite or we want to find the definite integralgoing from negative oneto threeof sevenx squareddx.What is this going to be equal to?Well, what we want to do isevaluate what is the antiderivative of this?Or you could say what is, if this is lowercase f of x,what is capital F of x?Well, the reverse power rule,we increase this exponent by one.So we're going to have seven times x to the third,and then we divide by that increased exponent.So seven x to the third divided by three,and we want to evaluate that at our upper boundand then subtract from thatand it evaluate it at our lower bound.So this is going to be equal to,so evaluating it at our upper bound,it's going to be seven times three to the third.I'll just write that three to the third over three.And then from that, we are going to subtractthis capital F of x,the antiderivative evaluated at the lower bound.So that is going to beseven times negative one to the third,all of that over three.And so this first expression, let's see,this is going to be seventimes three to the third over three.This is 27over three.This is going to be the same thing as seven times nine.So this is going to be 63.And this over here,negative one to the third power is negative one.But then we were subtracting a negative,so this is just gonna be adding.And so this is just going to be plus seven over three.Plus sevenover three,if we wanted to express this as a mixed number,seven over three is the same thing as 2 1/3.So when we add everything together,we are going to get 65 1/3.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/evaluating-definite-integral-with-power-rule	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So we wanna evaluate the definite integralfrom negative one to negative twoof 16 minus x to the third over x to the third dx.Now at first this might seem daunting,I have this rational expression, I have xs in the numeratorsand xs in the denominators, but we just have to remember,we just have to do some algebraic manipulation,and this is going to seem a lot more attractable.This is the same thing as the definite integralfrom negative one to negative two of16 over x to the thirdminus x to the thirdover x to the third,minus x to the third over x to the third dx.And now what is that going to be equal to?That is going be equal to the definite integralfrom negative one to negative two of,I could write this first term right over here,let me do this in a different color.I could write, I could write thisas 16x to the negative three, x to the negative three,and this second one,we have minus x to the third over x to the third.Well x to the third is just over,x to the third over x to the thirdis just going to be equal to one.So this is going to be minus one dx,so dx.And so what is this going to be equal to?Well, let's take the antiderivative of each of these partsand then we're going to have to evaluate themat the different bounds.So, let's see.The antiderivative of 16x to the negative three,we're just gonna do the power rulefor derivatives in reverse.You can view this as the power rule of integrationor the power rule of taking the antiderivativewhere what you do isyou're gonna increase our exponent by one,so you're gonna go from negative three to negative two,and then you're gonna divide by that amount,by negative two.So it's going to be 16 divided by negative twotimes x to the negative two.All I did is I increased the exponentand I divided by that amount.So that's the antiderivative here.And 16 divided by negative two,that is just negative eight.So we have negative eight, x to the negative two.And then the antiderivative of negative one,well, that's just negative x, negative, negative x,negative x.And actually you might just know that,and then hey, if I take the derivative of negative xI get negative one, or if you view thisas negative x to the zero power, because that's what one is,well, it's the same thing.You increase the exponent by oneto get x to the first power.And then you divide by one and so,I mean, you can view it as that right over there,but either way you get to negative or minus x.And so now we want to evaluate that.We're going to evaluate that at the boundsand take the difference.So we're going to evaluate that at negative twoand then subtract from that this evaluated at negative one.And let me do those in two different colorsso we can see what's going on.So we're gonna evaluate it at negative twoand we're gonna evaluate it at negative one.So let's first evaluate it at negative two.So this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to,when you evaluate it at negative two,it's going to be negative eight, negative eighttimes x to the negative two.So negative two the the negative two powerminus negative two.And from that we're going to subtract itand evaluate it at negative one.So, it's going to be negative eight times negative oneto the negative two power minus negative one.All right, so then what is this going to be?So, negative two the negative two.So negative two to the negative twois equal to one over negative two squared,which is equal to 1/4.So this is equal to positive 1/4,but then negative eight times positive 1/4is going to be equal to negative two.And then we have negative two minus negative two,so that's negative two plus two.And so everything I've just done in this purplish colorthat is just going to be zero.And then if we look at what's going on in the orange,when you evaluate it at negative one,let's see, negative one to the negative two power,well, that's one over negative one squared.Well, this all is just going to be one.And so we're gonna have negative eight plus one,which is equal to negative seven.So all of this evaluates to negative seven.But remember, we're subtracting negative seven,and so this is going to result,we deserve a little bit of a drum roll,this is going to be equal to positive, positive seven.And obviously you don't have to writethat positive out in front,I just wrote that just to emphasizethat this is going to be a positive seven.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/definite-integral-of-cube-root	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So, we want to evaluate thedefinite integral from negative one to eightof 12 times the cube root of x dx.Let's see, this is going to be the same thingas the definite integral from negative oneto eight of 12 times, the cube root isthe same thing as saying x to the 1/3 power dxand so now, if we want to take the antiderivativeof the stuff on the inside,we're just going to do essentially the power rule,it conduces the power rule of integralsor it's the reverse of the power rule for derivatives,where we increase this exponent by oneand then we divide by that increased exponent.So, this is going to be equal to 12 times xto the 1/3 plus one.Let me do that in another color,so we can keep track of it.X to the 1/3 plus one and then we're going to divideby 1/3 plus one and so, what's 1/3 plus one,well, that's 4/3, 1/3 plus 3/3, that's 4/3.So, I could write it this way.I could write this x to the 4/3 divided by4/3 and this is going to beand I'm going to evaluate this at the bounds.So, I'm going to evaluate this atand I'll do this in different colors,I'm going to evaluate it at eightand I'm going to evaluate it at negative oneand I'm going to subtract it and evaluate itat negative one from this expression evaluated at eight,and so what is this going to be equal to?Well, actually, let me simplify a little bit more.What is 12 divided by 4/3?So, 12, I'll do it right, well, I'lldo it right over here,12 over 4/3 is equal to 12 times 3/4,which will give you as 12/1 times 3/4,12 divided by four is three,so this is going to be equal to nine,3/4 of 12 is nine.So, this, we could rewrite this,we could write this as nine x to the 4/3 power.So, if we evaluate it at eight,this is going to be nine times eightto the 4/3 power and from that,we're going to subtract and evaluate it at negative one.So, this is going to be nine times negative oneto the 4/3 power.So, what is eight to the 4/3 power?I'll do it over here.So, eight to the 4/3 is equal to eightto the 1/3 to the fourth power,these are just exponent properties here.Eight to the 1/3, the cube root of eight,or eight to the 1/3 power, that's two,'cause two to the third power is eightand two to the fourth power,well two to the fourth power is equal to 16.So, eight to the 4/3 is 16 and what's a negative oneto the 4/3?Well, same idea, negative one to the 4/3is equal to negative one, there's severalway you could do it.You could say negative one to the fourthand the cube root of that,or the cube root of negative oneand then raise that to the fourth power, either way.So, let's do it the first way.Negative one to the fourth and thentake the cube root of that.Well, negative one to the fourth is just oneand then one to the 1/3 power,well that's just going to be equal to one.So, what we have here in blue,that's just equal to one.So, we have nine times 16 minus nine time one,well, that's just going to be nine times 15.We have 16/9 and then we're going take away a nine,so that's going to be nine times 15,so what is that?That is going to be equal to nine times 15is 90 plus 45, which is equal to 135,135 and we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/definite-integral-of-sine-based-function	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can evaluatethe definite integral from 11 pi overtwo to six piof nine sine of x dx.So the first thing, let's see if we can takethe antiderivative of nine sine of x,and we could use some of our integrationproperties to simplify this a little bit.So this is going to be equal to,this is the same thing as nine times the integralfrom 11 pi over two to six pi of sine of x dx.And what's the anitderivative of sine of x?Well we know, from our derivatives, that thederivative with respect to x of cosine of xis equal to negative sine of x,negative sine of x.So can we construct this in some wayso this is a negative sine of x?What if I multiplied, on the inside,what if I multiplied it by negative one?Well I can't just multiply in only one placeby negative one, I need to multiply bynegative one twice so I'm not changing its value.So what if I said negative nine times negative sine of x?Well this is still gonna be nine sine of x.If you took negative nine times negative sine of x,it is nine sine of x, and I did it this waybecause now negative sine of x,it matches the derivative of cosine of x.So we could say that this is all going to be equal to,it's all going to be equal to, you have yournegative nine out front, negative nine times,times, I'll put it in brackets,negative nine times, the antiderivativeof negative sine of x, well thatis just going to be cosine of x,cosine of x,and we're going to evaluate it at its bounds.We're going to evaluate it at six pi,let me do that in a color I haven't used yet,we're gonna do that at six pi, and we'realso going to do that at 11 pi over two,11 pi over two, so this is going to be equal to,this is equal to negative nine times,I'm going to create some space here,so actually that's probably more space than I need,it's going to be cosine of six pi,cosine of six pi,minus cosine of 11 pi over two,cosine of 11 pi over two.Well what is cosine of six pi going to be?Well, cosine of any multiple oftwo pi is going to be equal to one.You could view six pi as, we're goingaround the unit circle three times.So this is the same thing as cosine of two pi,or the same thing as cosine of zero,so that is going to be equal to one.If that seems unfamiliar to youI encourage you to review theunit circle definition of cosine.And what is cosine of 11 pi over two?Let's see, let's subtract some,let's subtract some multiple of two pi hereto put it in values that we can understand better.So this is, so let me write it here,cosine of 11 pi over 2, that is the same thing as,let's see, if we were to subtract,this is the same thing as cosine of11 pi over two minus, this is the same thingas five and one half pi, right?Yeah, so this is, so we could view this as,we could subtract, let's subtract four pi,which is going to be, we couldwrite that as eight pi over two.In fact, no, let's subtract five,no, let's subtract four pi, which is eight pi over 2.So once again, I'm just subtractinga multiple of two pi, which isn't gonna changethe value of cosine, and so this is going to beequal to cosine of 3 pi over 2.And if we imagine the unit circle,and let me draw the unit circle here.So it's my y axis, my x axis, and thenI have the unit circle, so, whoops.So the unit circle just like that.So if we start at, this is zero,then you go to pi over two, then yougo to pi, then you go to three pi over two,so that's this point on the unit circle,so the cosine is the x coordinate,so this is going to be zero.This is zero so this is zero, and so we getone minus zero, so everything in the bracketsevaluates out to one, and so we are left with,so let me do that, so all of this is equal to one.And so you have negative nine times one,which of course is just negative nine,is what this definite integral evaluates to.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/definite-integral-involving-natural-log	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's now take the definite integralfrom two to fourof six plus x squaredover x to the third power dx.At first this might seem pretty daunting.I have this rational expression.But if we just rewrite this, it might jump out at youhow this could be a little bit simpler.So this is equal to the integral from two to fourof six over x to the third powerplus x squared over x to the third power dx.I just separated this numerator out.I just divided each of those terms by x to the third power.And this I could rewrite.This is equal to the integral from two to fourof six x to the negative three power,that's that first term there.And x squared divided by x to the third,well that it going to be one over x.So plus one over x dx.Now this is going to be equal to,let's take the antiderivative of the different partsand we're going to evaluate that at fourand we're going to evaluate that at two.And we're going to find the difference betweenthe antiderivative valued at four and at two.Now what is the antiderivativeof six x to the negative three?Well, here, once again we can just use,we could use the power rule for taking the antiderivativeor it's the reverse of the derivative power rule.We know that if we're taking the integralof x to the n dx,the antiderivative of thatis going to be x to the n plus one over n plus one.And if we were just taking an indefinite integralthere would be sum pluc C.The reason why we don't put the plus Cs hereis when you evaluate at both bounds of integration,the C would cancel out regardless of what it is.So we don't really think about the C muchwhen we're taking definite integrals.But let's apply that to six x to the negative third power.So it's going to be, we're going to takex to the negative three plus one.So it's x to the negative two.And so we're gonna divide by negative two as well.And, of course, we had that six out front from the get go.So that's the antiderivativeof six x to the negative three power.And what's the antiderivative of one over x?You might be tempted to use the same idea right over here.You might be tempted to say, all right,well the antiderivative of x to the negative one,which is the same thing as one over xwould be equal to x to the negative one plus oneover negative one plus one.But what is negative one plus one?It is zero.So this doesn't fit this property right over here.But lucky for us, there is another property.And we went the other waywhen we were first taking derivativesof natural log functions.The antiderivative of one over x or x to the negative oneis equal to, sometimes you'll see it writtenas natural log of x plus C.And sometimes and I actually prefer this one,because you could actually evaluate it for negative values,is to say the absolute value,the natural log of the absolute value of x.And this is useful, because this is definedfor negative values, not just positive values.The natural log of x is only definedfor positive values of x,but when you take the absolute value,now it could be negative or positive values of x.And it works, the derivative of this is indeed one over x.Now it's not so relevant here,because our bounds of integration are both positive.But if both of our bounds of integration were negative,you could still do this by just reminding yourselfthat this is a natural log of absolute value of x.So this, we could say is plus the natural logof the absolute value of x.It's not a bad habit to do it,and if everthing's positive, well,the absolute value of x is equal to x.And so what is this going to be equal to?This is equal to, let's evaluate everything at four.And actually before I even evaluate it at four,what's six divided by negative two, that's negative three.So if we evaluate it at four, it's going to benegative three over four squared.Four to the negative two is one over four squaredand then plus the natural log of the,we could say the absolute value of four,but the absolute value of four is just four.So the natural log of four.And from that we're going to subtracteverything evaluated at two.So let's do that.So if we evaluate it at two, it's going to be negative threeover two squared.So two to the negative two is one over two squared,over two squared, plus the natural log of,the absolute value of positive two is,once again, it's just two.And so what does this give us?So, let's try to simplify it a little bit.So this is negative 3/16.We'll do that same color.So this is going to be equal to negative,negative, sorry, not negative 3/16,it's gotta be very careful,oh, sorry, yes, it is negative 3/16.For some reason my brain started thinkingfour to the third power.Negative 3/16 plus natural log of four.And then this right over here is negative 3/4, negative 3/4,do that same color.This right over here is negative 3/4.We have this negative sign out frontthat we're going to have to distribute.So the negative of negative 3/4 is plus 3/4, plus 3/4,and then we're going to subtract,remember we're distributing this negative sign,the natural log, the natural log of two.And what does this equal to?All right, so this is going to be equal to,and I'm now going to switch to a neutral color.So let's add these two termsthat don't involve a natural log.And let's see, if we have a common denominatorthree over four is the same thing, that is the same thingas we multiply the numerator and the denominatorby four, that is 12 over 16.And so you have negative 3/16,negative 3/16 plus 12/16will give you 9/16, 9/16.And then we're gonna have the onesthat do involve the natural log.Natural log of four minus the natural log of two.So we could write this plus the natural log of fourminus the natural log of two.And you might remember from your logarithm propertiesthat this over here, this is the same thingas the natural log of four divided by two,this comes straight out of your logarithm properties.And so this is going to be the natural log of two,natural log of two.So, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll now.This is all going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to the natural log,nine over 16 plus the natural log of two,plus the natural log of two.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/definite-integrals-of-piecewise-functions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So we have a f of x right over hereand it's defined piecewise for x less than zero,f of x is x plus one,for x is greater than or equal to zero,f of x is cosine of pi x.And we want to evaluate the definite integralfrom negative one to one of f of x dx.And you might immediately say,well, which of these versions of f of xam I going to take the antiderivative from,because from negative one to zero,I would think about x plus one,but then from zero to oneI would think about cosine pi x.And if you were thinking that,you're thinking in the right direction.And the way that we can make thisa little bit more straightforwardis to actually split up this definite integral.This is going to be equal to the definite integralfrom negative one to zeroof f of x dxplus the integralfrom zero to oneof f of x dx.Now why was it useful for me to split it up this way,in particular to split the integralfrom negative one to one,split it into two intervals from negative one to zero,and zero to one?Well, I did that because x equals zerois where we switch,where f of x switches from being x plus oneto cosine pi x.So if you look at the interval from negative one to zero,f of x is x plus one.So f of x here is x plus one.And then when you go from zero to one,f of x is cosine pi x.So cosine of pi x.And so now we just have to evaluate each of these separatelyand add them together.So let's take the definite integral from negative oneto zero of x plus one dx.Well, let's see.The antiderivative x plus one is...antiderivative x is x squared over two.I'm just incrementing the exponentand then dividing by that value.And then plus x,and you could view it as I'm doing the same thing.If this is x to the zero, it'll be x to the first,x to the first over one,which is just x.And I'm gonna evaluate that at zeroand subtract from that,it evaluated at one.Sorry, it evaluated at negative one.And so this is going to be equal to...If I evaluate it at zero,let me do this in another color.If I evaluate it at zero,it's going to be zero squared over two,which is, well, I'll just write it.Zero squared over two plus zero.Well, all of that's just gonna be equal to zero.It evaluated at negative one.So minus negative one squared.Negative one squared over two plus negative one.So negative one squared is just one.So it's 1/2 plus negative one.1/2 plus negative one,or 1/2 minus one,is negative 1/2.So all of that is negative 1/2.But then we're subtracting negative 1/2.Zero minus negative 1/2is going to be equal to positive 1/2.So this is going to be equal to positive 1/2.So this first part right over hereis positive 1/2.And now let's evaluate the integralfrom zero to one of cosine pi,I don't need that first parentheses,of cosine of pi x dx.What is this equal to?Now, if we were just trying to findthe antiderivative of cosine of x,it's pretty straightforward.We know that the derivative with respect to xof sine of xis equal to cosine of x.But that's not what we have here,we have cosine of pi x.So there is a technique here,you can call it u-substitution.You can say u is equal to pi x.If you don't know how to do that,you can still try to think this through,where we could say, alright,well, maybe it involves sine of pi x somehow.So the derivative with respect to xof sine of pi xwould be what?Well, we would use the chain rule.It would be the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the insideor sine of pi x with respect to pi x,which would be cosine of pi x,and then times the derivative of the inside functionwith respect to x.So it would be times pi.Or you could say the derivative of sine pi xis pi cosine of pi x.Now, we almost have that here,except we just need a pi.So what if we were to throw a pi right over here,but so we don't change the valuewe also multiply by one over pi?So if you divide and multiply by the same number,you're not changing its value.One over pi times pi is just equal to one.But this is useful.This is useful because we now know that pi cosine pi xis the derivative of sine pi x.So this is all going to be equal to...This is equal to one.Let me take that one over pi.So this is equal to one over pitimes...Now we're going to evaluate.So the antiderivative here we just saidis sine of pi x,and we're going to evaluate that at one and at zero.So this is going to be equal to one over pi.One over pi, not pi.My hand is not listening to my mouth.One over pi times sine of piminus sine of pi times zero, which is just zero.Well, sine of pi, that's zero.Sine of zero is zero.So you're gonna have one over pitimes zero minus zero.So this whole thing is just all going to be equal to zero.So this first part was 1/2,this second part right over here is equal to zero,so the whole definite integral is gonna be 1/2 plus zero,which is equal to 1/2.So all of that together is equal to 1/2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-definite-integrals-of-common-functions/v/definite-integral-of-absolute-value	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So we have f of x being equalto the absolute value of x plus two.And we wanna evaluate the definite integralfrom negative four to zero of f of x, dx.And like always, pause this videoand see if you can work through this.Now when you first do this you mightstumble around a little bit, becausehow do you take the anti-derivativeof an absolute value function?And the key here is to, one way to approach itis to rewrite f of x without the absolute valueand we can do that by rewriting itas a piecewise function.And the way I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna thinkabout intervals where whatever we takeinside the absolute value's going to be positiveand other intervals where everythingthat we take inside the absolute valueis going to be negative.And the point at which we changeis where x plus two is equal to zeroor x is equal to negative two.So let's just think about the intervalsx is less than negative two and x is greater thanor equal to negative two.And this could have been less thanor equal, in which case this would have been greater than,either way it would have been equal to thisabsolute vale, this is a continuous function here.And so when, let's do the easier case.When x is greater than or equal to negative twothen x plus two is going to be positive,or it's going to be greater thanor equal to zero, and so the absolute value of itis just going to be x plus two.So it's going to be x plus twowhen x is greater than or equal to negative two.And what about when x is less than negative two?Well when x is less than negative two,x plus two is going to be negative,and then if you take the absolute valueof a negative number you're gonna takethe opposite of it.So this is going to be negative x plus two.And to really help grok this, 'cause franklythis is the hardest part of what we're doing,and really this is more algebra than calculus.Let me draw the absolute value functionto make this clear.So that is my x-axis, that is my y-axisand let's say we're here at negative two.And so when we are less than the negative two,when x is less than negative two my graphis going to look like this.It is going to look something,it's gonna look like that.And when we are greater than negative two,do that in a different color, when we are greaterthan negative two it's going to look like this.It's going to look like that.And so notice this is in blue we have,this is the graph x plus two, we can saythis is a graph of y equals x plus two.And what we have in magenta right over here,this is the graph of negative x minus two.It has a negative slope and we interceptthe y-axis at negative two.So it makes sense.There's multiple ways that you could reason through this.Now once we break it up then we canbreak up the integral.We could say that what we wrote here,this is equal to the integralfrom negative four to two, sorry negative fourto negative two of f of x, which is in that caseit's going to be negative x minus two,I just distributed the negative sign there.Dx, and then plus the definite integralgoing from negative two to zeroof x plus two, dx.And just to make sure we knowwhat we're doin' here, if this is negative fourright over here, this is zero, that first integralis gonna give us this area right over here.What's the area under the curve negative x minus two,under that curve or under that line and above the x-axis.And the second integral is gonna give us this arearight over here between x plus twoand the x-axis going from negative two to zero.And so let's evaluate each of theseand you might even be able to just evaluate thesewith a little bit of triangle areas,but let's just do this analytically or algebraically.And so what's the anti-derivative of negative x?Well that's negative x-squared over two,and then we have the negative two,so this is gonna be the anti-derivativeis negative two x, we're gonna evaluate thatat negative two and negative four.And so that part is going to be what?Negative two squared, so it's the negativeof negative two squared.So it's negative four over two minus two times negative two.So plus four.So that's it evaluated at negative two.And then minus, if we evaluate it at negative four.So we're gonna have minus negative four squaredis 16 over two, minus two times negative four.So that is plus eight.So what is that going to give us?So this is negative two, this right over hereis negative eight, so the second term right over hereis just going to be equal to zero.Did I do that right?Yeah, the 16 over two, it's negative and this is positive.Okay, so this is just going to be zero.And this is negative two plus fourwhich is going to be equal to two.So what we have here in magenta is equal to two.And what we have here in the blue,well let's see, this is the anti-derivativeof x-squared over two, plus two x,gonna evaluate it at zero and negative two.You evaluate this thing at zero,it's just gonna be zero and from thatyou're going to subtract negative two squared over two.That is positive four over twowhich is positive two.And then plus two times negative two.So minus four.And so this is going to be the negativeof negative two, or positive two.So it's two plus two.And that makes sense that what we havein magenta here is two and what we have over hereis two, there's the symmetry here.There is a symmetry here.And so you add 'em all togetherand you get our integral is going to be equal to four.And once again, just as a reality checkyou could say, look, the height here is two,the width, the base here is two.Two times two times one-half is indeed equal to two.Same thing over here.So that's the more geometric argumentfor why that area's two, that area is two,add 'em together you get positive four.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-defining-u	khanacademy	video	:00- [Tutor] What we're going to do in this videois give ourselves some practicein the first step of u substitution,which is often the most difficultfor those who are first learning itand that's recognizing when u substitution is appropriateand then defining an appropriate u.So let's just start with an example here,so let's say we wanna take the indefinite integralof two x plus one timesthe square root of x squared plus x, dx,does u substitution apply here and if it does,how would you define the u?Pause the video and try to think about that.Well, we just have to remind ourselves,that u substitution is really trying to undo the chain rule,if we remind ourselves what the chain rule tells us,it says look, if we have a composite function,let's say f of g of x,f of g of x and we take the derivative of thatwith respect to x,that that is going to be equalto the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside function,so f primeof g of xtimes the derivative of the inside function,times the derivative of the inside functionand so u substitution is all aboutwell, do we see a pattern like that inside the integral?Do we see a potential inside function, a g of x,where I see its derivative being multiplied?Well, we see that over here,if I look at x squared plus x,if I make that the u, what's the derivative of that?Well, the derivative of x squared plus x is two x plus one,so we should make that substitution,if we say u is equal to x squared plus x,then we could say du dx,the derivative of u with respect to xis equal to two x plus one,if we treat our differentials like variables or numbers,we can multiply both sides by dx,which is a little bit of hand wavy mathematics,but it's appropriate here,so we could say two x plus one times dxand now what's really interesting hereis we have our u right over thereand notice we have our two x plus one times dx,in fact it's not conventional to see an integralrewritten the way I'm about to write it, but I will,I could rewrite this integral, you should really viewthis is the product of three things,oftentimes people will just view the dxas somehow part of the integral operator,but you could rearrange it,this would actually be legitimate,you could say the integral of the square rootof x squared plus x times two x plus one dxand if you wanted to be really clear,you could even put all of those thingsin parentheses or something like thatand so here,this is our uand this right over here is our duand so we could rewrite this as beingequal to the integralof the square root of u,'cause x squared plus x is u,times du, which is much easier to evaluate.If you are still confused there,you might recognize it if I rewrite thisas u to the one half power,because now we could just use the reverse power ruleto evaluate thisand then we would have to undo the substitution,once we figure out what this anti derivative is,we then would then reverse substitutethe x expression back in for the u.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-defining-u-exp	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois get some more practice identifying when to useu-substitution and picking an appropriate u.So let's say we havethe indefinite integral ofnatural log ofx to the,to the 10th power,all of that over x dx.Does u-substitution apply,and if so how would we make that substitution?Well the key for u-substitution is to see,do I have some function and its derivative?And you might immediately recognizethat the derivative of natural log of xis equal to one over x.To make it a little bit clearer,I could write this as the integral ofnatural log of x to the 10th powertimes one over x dx.Now it becomes clear.We have some function, natural log of x,being raised to the 10th power,but we also have its derivative right over here,one over x.So we could make the substitution.We could say that uis equal to the natural log of x.And the reason why I picked natural log of xis because I see something,I see its exact derivative here,something close to its derivative, in this caseits exact derivative.And so then I could say,du dx,du dx is equal to one over x,which means that duis equal to one over x dx.And so here you have it.This right over here is du,and then this right over here is our u.And so this nicely simplifies tothe integral ofu to the 10th power,u to the 10th power du.And so you would evaluate what this is,find the antiderivative here,and then you would back-substitute the natural log of xfor u, to actually evaluate this indefinite integral.Let's do another one.Let's say that we havethe integral of,let's do something,let's do something interesting here.Let's say the integral of tangent x dx.Does u-substitution apply here?And at first you say well I just have a tangent of x,where is its derivative?But one interesting thing to do is wellwe can rewrite tangent in terms of sine and cosine.So we can write this as the integral ofsine of xover cosine of x dx.And now you might saywell where does u-substitution apply here?Well there's a couple of ways to think about it.You could say the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x,but you're now dividing by the derivativeas opposed to multiplying by it.But more interesting you could saythe derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x.We don't have a negative sine of x,but we can do a little bit of engineering.We can multiply by negative one twice.So we could say the negative of the negative sine of x,and I stuck one of the you could say negative onesoutside of the integral,which comes straight from our integration properties.This is equivalent.I can put a negative on the outside,a negative on the inside,so that this is the derivative of cosine of x.And so now this is interesting.In fact let me rewrite this.This is going to be equal to negative,the negative integral,of one over cosine of xtimes negative sine of x dx.Now does it jump out at you what our u might be?Well I have a cosine of x in the denominator,and I have its derivative,so what if I made u equal to cosine of x?u is equal to cosine of x,and then du dxwould be equal to negative sine of x.Or I could saythat du is equal to negative sine of x dx.And just like that I have my du here,and this of course is my u.And so my whole thing has now simplified to,it's equal to,the negativeindefinite integral of one over u,one over u du.Which is a much easier integral to evaluate,and then once you evaluate this,you back-substitute cosine of x for u.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-example-2	khanacademy	video	:00So we want to take the indefinite integral of 4x^3 over x^4 plus 7 dx.So how can we tackle this? It seems like a hairy integral.Now the key inside here is to realize you have this expression x^4 + 7and you also have its derivative up here. The derivative of x^4 plus 7 is equal to 4x^3.Derivative of x^4 is 4x^3; derivative of 7 is just 0.So that's a big clue that u-substitution might be the tool of choice here.U-sub -- I'll just write u- -- I'll write the whole thing.U-Substitution could be the tool of choice. So given that, what would you want to set your u equal to?And I'll let you think about that 'cause it can figure out this partand the rest will just boil down to a fairly straightforward integral.Well, you want to set u be equal to the expression that you have its derivative laying around.So we could set u equal to x^4 plus 7. Now, what is du going to be equal to?du, I'm doing it in magenta. du, well it's just going to be the derivative of x^4 plus 7 with respect to x,so 4x^3 plus 0 times dx. I wrote it in differential form right over here,but it's a completely equivalent statement to saying that du, the derivative of u with respect to x,is equal to 4x^3 power. When someone writes du over dx, like this is really a notation to saythe derivative of u with respect to x. It really isn't a fraction in a very formal way,but often times, you can kind of pseudo-manipulate them like fractions.So if you want to go from here to there, you can kind of pretend that you're multiplying both sides by dx.But these are equivalent statements and we want to get it in differential formin order to do proper use of u-substitution. And the reason why this is useful --and I'll just rewrite it up here so that it becomes very obvious;our original integral we can rewrite as 4x^3 dx over x^4 plus 7.And then it's pretty clear what's du and what's u.U, which we set to be equal to x^4 plus 7. And then du is equal to this.It's equal to 4x^3 dx. We saw it right over here. So we could rewrite this integral --I'll try to stay consistent with the colors -- as the indefinite integral,well we have in magenta right over here, that's du over -- try to stay true to the colors --over x^4 plus 7, which is just u. Or, we could rewrite this entire thing asthe integral of 1 over u du. Well, what is the indefinite integral of 1 over u du?Well that's just going to be equal to the natural log of the absolute value --and we use the absolute value so it'll be defined even for negative U's --and it actually does work out. I'll do another video where I'll show you it definitely does.The natural log of the absolute value of u and then we might have a constant there that was lost when we took the derivative.So that's essentially our answer in terms of u. But now we need to un-substitute the u.So what happens when we un-substitute the u?Well, then we are left with -- this is going to be equal to --the natural log of the absolute value of -- well, u is x^4 plus 7 -- not C, plus 7 --and then we can't forget our plus C out here. And we are done!
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-with-ln-x	khanacademy	video	:00We are faced with a fairly daunting-lookingindefinite integral of pi over x natural log of x dx.Now, what can we do to address this?Is u-substitution a possibility here?Well for u-substitution, we want to lookfor an expression and its derivative.Well, what happens if we set u equal to the natural log of x?Now what would du be equal to in that scenario?du is going to be the derivative of the natural log of xwith respect to x, which is just 1/x dx.This is an equivalent statement to sayingthat du dx is equal to 1/x.So do we see a 1/x dx anywhere in this original expression?Well, it's kind of hiding.It's not so obvious, but this x in the denominatoris essentially a 1/x.And then that's being multiplied by a dx.Let me rewrite this original expressionto make a little bit more sense.So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take the pi.I should do that in a different colorsince I've already used-- let me take the piand just stick it out front.So I'm going to stick the pi out in front of the integral.And so this becomes the integral of--and let me write the 1 over natural log of x first.1 over the natural log of x times 1/x dx.Now it becomes a little bit clearer.These are completely equivalent statements.But this makes it clear that, yes,u-substitution will work over here.If we set our u equal to natural log of x, thenour du is 1/x dx.Let's rewrite this integral.It's going to be equal to pi times the indefinite integralof 1/u.Natural log of x is u-- we set that equal to natural logof x-- times du.Now this becomes pretty straightforward.What is the antiderivative of all of this business?And we've done very similar things like this multiple timesalready.This is going to be equal to pi times the natural logof the absolute value of u so that wecan handle even negative values of u.The natural log of the absolute value of u plus c,just in case we had a constant factor out here.And we're almost done.We just have to unsubstitute for the u.u is equal to natural log of x.So we end up with this kind of neat-looking expression.The anti of this entire indefiniteintegral we have simplified.We have evaluated it, and it is nowequal to pi times the natural log of the absolute value of u.But u is just the natural log of x.And then we have this plus c right over here.And we could have assumed that, from the get go,this original expression was onlydefined for positive values of x because you hadto take the natural log here, and itwasn't an absolute value.So we can leave this as just a natural log of x,but this also works for the situationsnow because we're doing the absolute value of that wherethe natural log of x might have been a negative number.For example, if it was a natural log of 0.5 or, who knows,whatever it might be.But then we are all done.We have simplified what seemed like a kindof daunting expression.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-definite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois get some practiceapplying u-substitution to definite integrals.So let's say we have the integral,so we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two,and the integral is two x timesx squared plus one to the third power dx.So I already told you that we're gonna apply u-substitution,but it's interesting to be able to recognize when to use it.And the key giveaway here is,well I have this x squared plus one businessto the third power,but then I also have the derivative of x squared plus onewhich is two x right over here.So I can do the substitution.I could say,u is equal to x squared plus one,in which case the derivative of u with respect to xis just two x plus zero or just two x.I could write that in differential form.A mathematical hand waving way of thinking about itis multiplying both sides by dx.And so you get du is equal to two x dx.And so at least this part of the integralI can rewrite.So let me at least write,so this is going to be,I'll write the integral.We're going think about the bounds in a second.So we have u to the third power,u, the same orange color,u to the third power.That's this stuff right over here.And then two xtimes dx.Remember you could just view this as two xtimes x squared plus one to the third power times dx.So two x times dx,well two x times dx, that is du.So that and that together,that is du.Now an interesting question,because this isn't an indefinite integral,we're not just trying to find the antiderivative.This is a definite integral.So what happens to our bounds of integration?Well there's two ways that you can approach this.You can change your bounds of integration.Because this one is x equals one to x equals two.But now we're integrating with respect to u.So one way if you want to keep your bounds of integration,or if you wanna keep this a definite integralI guess you could say,you would change your bounds from u is equal to somethingto u is equal to something else.And so your bounds of integration,let's see when x is equal to one, what is u?Well when x is equal to one,you have one squared plus one,so you have two, u is equal to two in that situation.When x is equal to two, what is u?Well you have two squared which is fourplus one, which is five,so u is equal to five.And you won't typically see someone writingu equal two or u equals five.It's often just from two to fivebecause we're integrating with respect to u,you assume it's u equals two to u equals five.And so we could just rewrite this as being equal tothe integral from two to fiveof u to the third du.But it's really important to realizewhy we changed our bounds.We are now integrating with respect to u,and the way we did it is we used our substitutionright over here.When x equals one, u is equal to two.When x is equal to two,two squared plus one, u is equal to five.And then we can just evaluate this right over here.Let's see this is going to be equal to,the antiderivative of u to the third poweris u to the fourth over four.We're gonna evaluate that at five and two.And so this is going to be five to the fourth over fourminus two to the fourth over four.And then we can simplify this if we like,but we've just evaluated this definite integral.Now another way to do itis to think about the,is to try to solve the indefinite integral in terms of xand use u-substitution as an intermediate.So one way to think about this is to say,well let's just try to evaluate whatthe indefinite integral of two xtimes x squared plus one to the third power dx is.And then whatever this expressionends up being algebraically,I'm going to evaluate it at x equals twoand at x equals one.And so then you use the u-substitution right over here,and you would get.This would simplify using the same substitutionas the integral of u, u to the third power,the du, u to the third power du,and once again you're going to evaluatethis whole thing from x equals twoand then subtract from thatit evaluated at x equals one.And so this is going to be equal to,well let's see this is u to the fourth powerover four.And once again evaluating it at x equals twoand then subtracting from that at x equals one.And then now we can just back-substitute.We can say hey look,u is equal to x squared plus one,so this is the same thing as x squared plus oneto the fourth power over four,and we're now going to evaluate thatat x equals two and at x equals one.And you will notice that you will getthe exact same thing.When you put x equals two here,you get two squared plus one which is fiveto the fourth power over four, that right over there.And then minus one squared plus one is twoto the fourth power over four,that right over there.So either way you'll get the same result.You can either keep it a definite integraland then change your bounds of integrationand express them in terms of u.That's one way to do it.The other way is to try to evaluatethe indefinite integral,use u-substitution as an intermediary step,then back-substitute back and then evaluateat your bounds.

Well we have a dx. Let me circle things.You have a dx here, you have a dx there.You have an x squared here, you have an x squared here.So really all we need is,all we need here is the natural log of eight.Ideally we would have the natural log of eight right overhere, and we could put it there as long as we also,we could multiply by the natural log of eightas long as we also divide by a natural log of eight.We can do it like right over here,we could divide by natural log of eight.But we know that the anti-derivative of some constanttimes a function is the same thing as a constanttimes the anti-derivative of that function.We could just take that on the outside.It's one over the natural log of eight.Let's write this in terms of u and du.This simplifies to one over the naturallog of eight times the anti-derivative ofe to the u, e to the u, that's the u, du.This times this times that is du, du.And this is straightforward,we know what this is going to be.This is going to be equal to, let me just writethe one over natural log of eight out here,one over natural log of eight times e to the u,and of course if we're thinking in terms of justanti-derivative there would be some constant out there.Then we would just reverse the substitution.We already know what u is.This is going to be equal to, the anti-derivative ofthis expression is one over the natural log of eighttimes e to the, instead of u, we know that u isx to the third times the natural log of two.And of course we could put a plus c there.Now, going back to the original problem.We just need to evaluate the anti-derivativeof this at each of these points.Let's rewrite that.Given what we just figured out, let me copy and paste that.This is just going to be equal to,it's going to be equal to the anti-derivative evaluatedat one minus the anti-derivative evaluated at zero.We don't have to worry about theconstants because those will cancel out.So we are going to get, we are going to get one--Let me evaluate it first at one.You're going to get one over the natural log ofeight times e to the one to the third power,which is just one, times the natural log of two,natural log of two, that's evaluated at one.Then we're going to have minus it evaluated it at zero.It's going to be one over the natural log ofeight times e to the, well when x is zerothis whole thing is going to be zero.Well e to the zero is just one, and e to the naturallog of two, well that's just going to be two,we already established that early on,this is just going to be equal to two.We are left with two over the natural log of eight minusone over the natural log of eight, which is just goingto be equal to one over the natural log of eight.And we are, and we are done."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/u-substitution-and-back-substitution	khanacademy	video	:00We're faced with the indefinite integral of x plus 3,times x minus 1 to the fifth dx.Now, we could solve this by literally multiplying outwhat x minus 1 to the fifth is.Maybe using the binomial theorem,that would take a while.And then we'd multiply that times x plus 3,and we'd end up with some polynomial.And we could take the antiderivative that way.Or we could maybe make a substitution herethat could simplify this expression here.Make it something that's a little bit easierto take the antiderivative of.And this isn't going to be kind of the more traditional usubstitution, where we just set u equal to somethingand see if its derivative is there.But it's a kind of a form of u substitution, wherewe do set u equal to something and see if it simplifiesour expression in a way that, I guess, simplifies it.So let's try things out.So we have this x minus 1 to the fifth.That would be a pain to expand out.It would be nice if this was just a u to the fifth.So let's just set this, let's just set this to be equal to u.So let's set u as equal to x minus 1.And in that case, du is equal to dx.We could write du/dx is equal to 1,derivative of x, derivative of negative 1 is just 0.And these two are completely equivalent statements.And so if we did that, how could werewrite this entire expression?Well, it would be equal to the integral of-- well,we have x plus 3 right over here, this is neither just unor is it du.So let's think about how, what we can do here.Well, we could say, if u is equal to x minus 1,we could add 1 to both sides of this equation.And we could say u plus 1 is equal to x.And so for x, we can substitute that with u plus 1.So let's do that.So we're kind of back substituting in for x.So x is equal to u plus 1.And I'm just trying to see if I can do somethingto simplify this expression.So x is u plus 1, then we have our plus 3 there,times x minus 1 to the fifth.x minus 1 was u, that's the simplificationwe wanted to make.So times u to the fifth power.And dx is the same thing as du.So du.Now did this get us anywhere?Can we simplify this to a form that it'seasy to take the antiderivative of?Well, it looks like it did.Let's see.We can rewrite this as this expression right over hereis just u plus 4.Times u to the fifth-- I'll do it all in one color, now-- du.And the reason why this simplified things-- the waythis simplified things is taking x minus oneto the fifth, that'd be a really hard thing to expand.But u to the fifth is just u to the fifth.And then it just changed this x plus 3into a u plus 4, which is still a pretty straightforwardexpression.And now we can just distribute the u to the fifth.So we are left with u to the sixth power plus 4,u to the fifth du.And this is a pretty straightforward thingto take the antiderivative of.Now you might be saying, hey Sal,this was-- how did you know to set u equal to be that.And oftentimes with integration, it'sgoing to take a little bit of trial and error.There's a certain bit of an art to it.But here the realization was well, x minus 1 to the fifthcan be really complicated.Maybe u to the fifth might make it a little bit simpler.And that did just happen to work.You could have tried u is equal to x plus 3.But it wouldn't have simplified itas nicely as u equal to x minus 1 did.But let's finish with this integral right over here.So this is going to be equal to the antiderivative of uto the sixth.Well, that's just u to the seventh over seven.Plus the antiderivative of u to the fifth, that'su to the sixth over six.But we have the 4 out here, so it's4 times u to the sixth over six.And then we have a plus C. And this, the 4u 6is the same thing as 2/3, so we can rewrite this whole thing asequal to u to the seventh over seven, plus 2/3 u to the sixth,plus C.And now we just have to undo our u substitution.u is equal to x minus 1.So this is going to be equal to x minus 1 to the seventh over 7plus 2/3 times x minus 1 to the sixth, plus C.And we're all done.We were able to take a fairly hairy-- or whatcould have been a hairy thing if we had to expand this out--and we were able to take the antiderivative by doinga little bit of this u substitutionand u back substitution.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/doing-u-substitution-twice-second-time-with-w	khanacademy	video	:00Let's see if we can take the integral of cosine of 5x over eto the sine of 5x dx.And there's a crow squawking outside of my window,so I'll try to stay focused.So let's think about whether u-substitutionmight be appropriate.Your first temptation might have said, hey,maybe we let u equal sine of 5x.And if u is equal to sine of 5x, wehave something that's pretty close to du up here.Let's verify that.So du could be equal to-- so du dx, derivative of uwith respect to x.Well, we just use the chain rule.Derivative of 5x is 5.Times the derivative of sine of 5x with respect to 5x,that's just going to be cosine of 5x.If we want to write this into differential form, whichis useful when we do our u-substitution,we could say that du is equal to 5 cosine 5x.And we look over here, we don't have quite du there.We have just cosine of 5x dx.Cosine of 5x dx just like that.So when you look over here, you have a cosine of 5x dx,but we don't have a 5 cosine of 5x dx.But we know how to solve that.We can multiply by 5 and divide by 5.1/5 times 5 is just going to be 1,so we haven't changed the value of the expression.When we do it this way, we see pretty clearly we have our uand we have our du.Our du is 5.Let me circle that.Let me do that in that blue color-- is 5 cosine of 5x dx.So we can rewrite this entire expressionas-- do that 1/5 in purple.This is going to be equal to 1/5--I hope you don't hear that crow outside.He's getting quite obnoxious.1/5 times the integral of all the stuff in blue is my du,and then that is over e to the u.So how do we take the antiderivative of this?Well, you might be tempted to well, what would you do here?Well, we're still not quite ready to simply takethe antiderivative here.If I were to rewrite this, I could rewrite thisas this is equal to 1/5 times the integral of eto the negative u du.And so what might jump out at youis maybe we do another substitution.We've already used the letter u, so maybe we'll use w.We'll do some w-substitution.And you might be able to do this in your head,but we'll do w-substitution just to makeit a little bit clearer.This would have been really useful if this was just eto the u because we know the antiderivative of e to the uis just e to the u.So let's try to get it in terms of the form of eto the something and not e to the negative something.So let's set.And I'm running out of colors here.Let's set w as equal to negative u.In that case, then dw, derivativeof w with respect to u, is negative 1.Or if we were to write that statement in differential form,dw is equal to du times negative 1 is negative du.So this right over here would be our w.And do we have a dw here?Well, we have just a du.We don't have a negative du there.But we can create a negative du by multiplying this insideby a negative 1, but then also by multiplying the outsideby a negative 1.Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1.We haven't changed the value.We have to do both of these in order for it to make sense.Or I could do it like this.So negative 1 over here and a negative 1 right over there.And if we do it in that form, then this negative 1 times du,that's the same thing as negative du.This is this right over here.And so we can rewrite our integral.It's going to be equal to now it's going to be negative 1/5.Trying to use the colors as best as I can.Negative 1/5 times the indefinite integral of eto the-- well, instead of negative u,we can write w-- e to the w.And instead of du times negative 1, or negative du,we can write dw.Now this simplifies things a good bit.We know what the antiderivative of this is in terms of w.This is going to be equal to negative 1/5 e to the w.And then we might have some constant there,so I'll just do a plus c.And now we just have to do all of our unsubstituting.So we know that w is equal to negative u.So we could write that.So this is equal to negative 1/5.I want to stay true to my colors.Negative 1/5 e to the negative u, that's what w is equal to,plus c.But we're still not done unsubstituting.We know that u is equal to sine of 5x.u is equal to sine of 5x, so we can write thisas being equal to negative 1/5 times eto the negative u, which is negative u is sine of 5x.And then finally, we have our plus c.Now, there was a simpler way that we could have done thisby just doing one substitution.But then you would have had to look ahead a little bitand realize that it was not trivial to take your-- not toobad to take your antiderivative of e to the negative u.The insight that you might have had-- although you shouldn'treally hold yourself, feel too bad if youdidn't see that insight-- is that we could have rewrittenthat original integral-- and let me rewrite it.It's cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx.We could have written this entire original integralas being equal to cosine of 5x times eto the negative sine of 5x dx.And in this situation, we could have set uto be equal to negative 5x and say, well,if u is equal to negative sine of 5x.If u is equal to negative sine of 5x,then du is going to be equal to negative 5 cosine of 5x.And we don't have a negative-- oh, dx.We don't have a negative 5 here, but we could construct oneby putting a negative 5 there and then multiplyingby negative 1/5.And then that would have immediately simplifiedthis integral right over here to be equal to negative 1/5times the integral of well, we have our du.Let me do this in a different color.We have our du.That's the negative 5.Let me do it this way.Negative 5 cosine of 5x dx.So that is our du.I'm just changing the order of multiplication.Times e to the u.This whole thing now is u this second time around.So if we did it this way, with just one substitution,we could have immediately gotten to the result that we wanted.You take the antiderivative of this.I'll do it in one color now just because Ithink you get the idea.This is equal to negative 1/5 e to the u plus c.u is equal to negative sine of 5x.So this is equal to negative 1/5 eto the negative sine of 5x plus c And you're done.So this one is faster.It's simpler.And over time, you might even startbeing able to do this in your head.This top one, you still didn't mess upby just setting u equal to sine of 5x,we just have to do an extra substitution in orderto work it through all the way.And I was able to do this video despite the crowing crowoutside, or squawking crow.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-integrating-with-u-substitution/v/2-ln-x-x-antiderivative-example	khanacademy	video	:00I was just looking on the discussion boards on the KhanAcademy Facebook page, and Bud Denny put up this problem,asking for it to be solved.And it seems like a problem of general interest.If the indefinite integral of 2 to the natural log of xover, everything over x, dx.And on the message board, Abhi Khanna also put up a solution,and it is the correct solution, but I thought this was ofgeneral interest, so I'll make a quick video on it.So the first thing when you see an integral like this, is yousay, hey, you know, I have this natural log of x up inthe numerator, and where do I start?And the first thing that should maybe pop out at you, is thatthis is the same thing as the integral of one over x times 2to the natural log of x, dx.And so you have an expression here, or it's kind of part ofour larger function, and you have its derivative, right?We know that the derivative, let me write it over here, weknow that the derivative with respect to x of the naturallog of x is equal to 1/x.So we have some expression, and we have its derivative, whichtells us that we can use substitution.Sometimes you can do in your head, but this problem, it'sstill not trivial to do in your head.So let's make the substitution.Let's substitute this right here with a u.So let's do that.So if you define u, and it doesn't have to be u, it'sjust, that's the convention, it's called u-substitution, itcould have been s-substitution for all we care.Let's say u is equal to the natural log of x, and then dudx, the derivative of u with respect to x, of courseis equal to 1/x.Or, just the differential du, if we just multiply both sidesby dx is equal to 1 over x dx.So let's make our substitution.This is our integral.So this will be equal to the indefinite integral, or theantiderivative, of 2 to the now u, so 2 to the u,times 1 over x dx.Now what is 1 over x dx?That's just du.So this term times that term is just our du.Let me do it in a different color.1 over x times dx is just equal to du.That's just equal to that thing, right there.Now, this still doesn't look like an easy integral, althoughit's gotten simplified a good bit.And to solve, you know, whenever I see the variablethat I'm integrating against in the exponent, you know,we don't have any easy exponent rules here.The only thing that I'm familiar with, where I have myx or my variable that I'm integrating against inmy exponent, is the case of e to the x.We know that the integral of e to the x, dx, is equalto e to the x plus c.So if I could somehow turn this into some variation of e to thex, maybe, or e to the u, maybe I can make this integral alittle bit more tractable.So let's see.How can we redefine this right here?Well, 2, 2 is equal to what?2 is the same thing as e to the natural log of 2, right?The natural log of 2 is the power you have toraise e to to get 2.So if you raise e to that power, you're, ofcourse going to get 2.This is actually the definition of really, the natural log.You raise e to the natural log of 2, you're going to get 2.So let's rewrite this, using this-- I guess we could callthis this rewrite or-- I don't want to call itquite a substitution.It's just a different way of writing the number 2.So this will be equal to, instead of writing the number2, I could write e to the natural log of 2.And all of that to the u du.And now what is this equal to?Well, if I take something to an exponent, and then to anotherexponent, this is the same thing as taking my base to theproduct of those exponents.So this is equal to, let me switch colors, this is equalto the integral of e, to the u, e to the, letme write it this way.e to the natural log of 2 times u.I'm just multiplying these two exponents.I raise something to something, then raise it again, we knowfrom our exponent rules, it's just a product ofthose two exponents.du.Now, this is just a constant factor, right here.This could be, you know, this could just be some number.We could use a calculator to figure out what this is.We could set this equal to a.But we know in general that the integral, this is prettystraightforward, we've now put it in this form.The antiderivative of e to the au, du, is just1 over a e to the au.This comes from this definition up here, and of course plusc, and the chain rule.If we take the derivative of this, we take the derivativeof the inside, which is just going to be a.We multiply that times the one over a, it cancelsout, and we're just left with e to the au.So this definitely works out.So the antiderivative of this thing right here is going to beequal to 1 over our a, it's going to be 1 over our constantterm, 1 over the natural log of 2 times our wholeexpression, e e.And I'm going to do something.This is just some number times u, so I can write it asu times some number.And I'm just doing that to put in a form that might help ussimplify it a little bit.So it's e to the u times the natural log of 2, right?All I did, is I swapped this order.I could have written this as e to the naturallog of 2 times u.If this an a, a times u is the same thing as u times a.Plus c.So this is our answer, but we have to kind of reversesubstitute before we can feel satisfied that we've takenthe antiderivative with respect to x.But before I do that, let's see if I can simplifythis a little bit.What is, if I have, just from our natural log properties,or logarithms, a times the natural log of b.We know this is the same thing as the naturallog of b to the a.Let me draw a line here.Right?That this becomes the exponent on whatever we're takingthe natural log of.So u, let me write this here, u times the natural log of2, is the same thing as the natural log of 2 to the u.So we can rewrite our antiderivative as being equalto 1 over the natural log of 2, that's just that part here,times e to the, this can be rewritten based on thislogarithm property, as the natural log of 2 to the u, andof course we still have our plus c there.Now, what is e raised to the natural log of 2 to the u?The natural log of 2 to the u is the power that you have toraise e to to get to 2 to the u, right?By definition!So if we raise e to that power, what are we going to get?We're going to get 2 to the u.So this is going to be equal to 1 over the natural log of 2.This simplifies to just 2 to the u.I drew it up here.The natural log a I could just write in general terms, letme do it up here, and maybe I'm beating a dead horse.But I can in general write any number a as being equal toe to the natural log of a.This is the exponent you have to raise e to to get a.If you raise e to that, you're going to get a.So e to the natural log of 2 to the u, that's just 2 to the u.And then I have my plus c, of course.And now we can reverse substitute.What did we set u equal to?We defined u, up here, as equal to the natural log of x.So let's just reverse substitute right here.And so the answer to our original equation, your answerto, let me write it here, because it's satisfying whenyou see it, to this kind of fairly convoluted-lookingantiderivative problem, 2 to the natural log of x over x dx,we now find is equal to, we just replaced u with naturallog of x, because that was our substitution, and 1 over thenatural log of 2 times 2 to the natural log of x plus c.And we're done.This isn't in the denominator, the way I wrote it mightlook a little ambiguous.And we're done!And that was a pretty neat problem, and so thanksto Bud for posting that.

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-proof-videos-5/v/proof-of-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that we've got some functionf that is continuous on the interval a to b.So let's try to see if we can visualize that.So this is my y-axis.This right over here, I want to make it my t-axis.We'll use x little bit later.So I'll call this my t-axis.And then let's say that this right over hereis the graph of y is equal to f of t.And we're saying it's continuous on the interval from a to b.So this is t is equal to a.This is t is equal to b.So we're saying that it is continuousover this whole interval.Now, for fun, let's define a function capital F of x.And I will do it in blue.Let's define capital F of x as equal to the definite integralfrom a is a lower bound to x of f of t--let me do that in-- of f of t dt, wherex is in this interval, where a is less than or equal to xis less than or equal to b.Or that's just another way of sayingthat x is in this interval right over here.Now, when you see this, you might say, oh,the definite integral, this has to do with differentiationan antiderivatives and all that.But we don't know that yet.All we know right now is that thisis the area under the curve f between a and x, so between a,and let's say this right over here is x.So f of x is just this area right over here.That's all we know about it.We don't know it has anything to do with antiderivatives justyet.That's what we're going to try to prove in this video.So just for fun, let's take the derivative of f.And we're going to do it just usingthe definition of derivatives and seewhat we get when we take the derivative usingthe definition of derivatives.So the derivative, f prime of x-- well this definitionof derivatives, it's the limit as delta x approaches0 of capital F of x plus delta x minus fof x, all of that over delta x.This is just the definition of the derivative.Now, what is this equal to?Well, let me rewrite it using these integrals right up here.This is going to be equal to the limitas delta x approaches 0 of-- what's f of x plus delta x?Well, put x in right over here.You're going to get the definite integral from a to x plus deltax of f of t dt.And then from that, you are goingto subtract this business, f of x, which we've alreadywritten as the definite integral from a to x of f of t dt,and then all of that is over delta x.Now, what does this represent?Remember, we don't know anything about definite integralsor somehow dealing with somethingwith an antiderivative and all that.We just know this is another way of sayingthe area under the curve f between a and x plus delta x.So it's this entire area right over here.So that's this part.We already know what this blue stuff is.Let me do it in that same shade of blue.So this blue stuff right over here,this is equal to all of this business.We've already shaded this in.It's equal to all of this business right over here.So if you were to take all of this green area, whichis from a to x plus delta x, and subtract outthe blue area, which is exactly what we'redoing in the numerator what are you're left with?Well, you're going to be left with-- whatcolor have I not used yet?Maybe I will use this pink color.Well, no, I already used that.I'll use this purple color.You're going to be left with this area right over here.So what's another way of writing that?Well, another way of writing this area right over hereis the definite integral between x and xplus delta x of f of t dt.So we can rewrite this entire expression, the derivativeof capital F of x-- this is capital Fprime of x-- we can rewrite it now as being equal to the limitas delta x approaches 0-- this I can write as 1over delta x times the numerator.And we already figured out the numerator.The green area minus the blue area is just the purple area,and another way of denoting that areais this expression right over here.So 1 over delta x times the definite integralfrom x to x plus delta x of f of t dt.Now, this expression is interesting.This might look familiar from the mean valuetheorem of definite integrals.The mean value theorem of definite integralstells us there exists a c in the intervalsee where-- I'll write it this way--where a is less than or equal to c, which is less than--or actually, let me make it clear.The interval that we care about is between x and xplus delta x-- where x is less thanor equal to c, which is less thanor equal to x plus delta x, such that the function evaluatedat c-- so let me draw this c.So there's a c someplace over here--so if I were take the function evaluated at this c--so that's f of c right over here.So if I were to take the function evaluatedat this c, which would essentiallybe the height of this line, and I multiply times the base,this interval, if I multiply it times the interval--and this interval is just delta x. xplus delta x minus x is just delta x.So if we just multiply the height times the base,this is going to be equal to the area under the curve, whichis the definite integral from x to x plus delta x of f of t dt.This is what the mean value theorem of integrals tells us.If f is a continuous function, thereexists a c in this interval between our two end pointswhere the function evaluated at the c is essentially,you could view it as the mean height.And if you take that mean value of the functionand you multiply it times the base,you're going to get the area of the curve.Or another way of rewriting this,you could say that there exists a c in that interval wheref of c is equal to 1 over delta x-- I'm just dividingboth sides by delta x-- times the definite integral from xto x plus delta x of f of t dt.And this is often viewed as the mean valueof the function over the interval.Why is that?Well, this part right over here gives you the area,and then you divide the area by the base,and you get the mean height.Or another way you could say it is,if you were to take the height right over here, multiply ittimes the base, you get a rectangle thathas the exact same area as the area under the curve.Well, this is useful, because thisis exactly what we got as the derivative of f prime of x.So there must exist a c such that f of cis equal to this stuff.Or we could say that the limit-- and let me rewrite all of thisnow in a new color.So there exists a c in the intervalx to x plus delta x where f prime of x, which we knowis equal to this, we can now say is now equal to the limitas delta x approaches 0.And instead of writing this, we knowthat there's some c that's equal to all of this business,of f of c.Now we're in the home stretch.We just have to figure out what the limit as delta xapproaches 0 of f of c is.And the main realization is this part right over here.We know that c is always sandwiched in between x and xplus delta x.And intuitively, you can tell that, look,as delta x approaches 0, as this green line right over heremoves more and more to the left, as it approachesthis blue line, the c has to be in between,and so the c is going to approach x.So we know intuitively that c approachesx as delta x approaches 0.Or another way of saying it is that f of cis going to approach f of x as delta x approaches 0.And so intuitively, we could say that thisis going to be equal to f of x.Now, you might say, OK, that's intuitively,but we're kind of working on a little bit of a proofhere, Sal.Let me know for sure that x is going to approach c.Don't just do this little thing where you drew this diagramand it makes sense that c's goingto have to get closer and closer to x.And if you want that, you could justresort to the squeeze theorem.And to resort to the squeeze theorem,you just have to view c as a function of delta x.And it really is.Depending on your delta x, c's going to be further to the leftor to the right, possibly.And so I can just rewrite this expressionas x is less than or equal to c as a function of delta x, whichis less than or equal to x plus delta x.So now you see that c is always sandwiched between x and xplus delta x.But what's the limit of x as delta x approaches 0?Well, x isn't dependent on delta x in any way,so this is just going to be equal to x.What's the limit of x plus delta x as delta x approaches 0?Well, as delta x approaches 0, thisis just going to be equal to x.So if this approaches as delta x approaches 0,and it's less than this function,and if this approaches x as delta x approaches 0,and it's always greater than this,then we know from the squeeze theorem or the sandwich theoremthat the limit as delta x approaches0 of c as a function of delta x isgoing to be equal to x as well.It has to approach the same thing that that and that is.It's sandwiched in between.And so that's a slight-- we resort to the sandwichtheorem-- it's a little bit more rigorous--to get to this exact result.As delta x approaches 0, c approaches x.If c is approaching x, then f of c is going to approach f of x.And then we essentially have our proof.F is a continuous function.We defined capital F in this way,and we were able to use just the definition of the derivativeto figure out that the derivative of capital F of xis equal to f of x.And once again, why is this a big deal?Well, it tells you that if you have any continuous functionf-- and that's what we assume.We assume that f is continuous over the interval-- thereexists some function-- you can justdefine the function this way as the areaunder the curve between some endpoint, or the beginningof the interval, and sum x-- if you definea function in that way, the derivative of this functionis going to be equal to your continuous function.Or another way of saying it is that you alwayshave an antiderivative, that any continuous function hasan antiderivative.And so it's a couple of cool things.Any continuous function has an antiderivative.It's going to be that capital F of x.And this is why it's called the fundamental theoremof calculus.It ties together these two ideas.And you have differential calculus.You have the idea of a derivative.And then in integral calculus, youhave the idea of an integral.Before this proof, all we viewed an integralas is the area under the curve.It was just literally a notation to saythe area under the curve.But now we've been able to make a connection that there'sa connection between the integral and the derivative,or a connection between the integral and the antiderivativein particular.So it connects all of calculus together in a very, very, verypowerful-- and we're so used to it now,and now we can say almost a somewhat obvious way,but it wasn't obvious.Remember, we always think of integralsas somehow doing an antiderivative,but it wasn't clear.If you just viewed an integral as only an area,you would have to go through this processto say, wow, no, it's connected to the process of takinga derivative.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-integrals/cs1-proof-videos-5/v/intuition-for-second-fundamental-theorem-of-calculus	khanacademy	video	:00Let's say that I have some function, s of t,which is positioned as a function of time.And let me graph a potential s of t right over here.We have a horizontal axis as the time axis.Let me just graph something.I'll draw it kind of parabola-looking.Although I could have done it general,but just to make things a little bit simpler for me.So I'll draw it kind of parabola-looking.We call this the y-axis.We could even call this y equals s of t as a reasonable wayto graph our position as a function of time function.And now let's think about what happensif we want to think about the change in position between twotimes, let's say between time a-- let's say that's timea right over there-- and then this right over here is time b.So time b is right over here.So what would be the change in position between time aand between time b?Well, at time b, we are at s of b position.And at time a we were at s of a position.So the change in position between timea and time b-- let me write this down-- the change in positionbetween-- and this might be obvious to you,but I'll write it down-- between times aand b is going to be equal to s of b, this position,minus this position, minus s of a.So nothing earth-shattering so far.But now let's think about what happensif we take the derivative of this function right over here.So what happens when we take the derivativeof a position as a function of time?So remember, the derivative gives usthe slope of the tangent line at any point.So let's say we're looking at a point right over there,the slope of the tangent line.It tells us for a very small change in t--I'm exaggerating it visually-- for a very, very small changein t, how much are we changing in position?So we write that as ds dt is the derivative of our positionfunction at any given time.So when we're talking about the rate at which position changeswith respect to time, what is that?Well, that is equal to velocity.So this is equal to velocity.But let me write this in different notations.So this itself is going to be a function of time.So we could write this is equal to s prime of t.These are just two different waysof writing the derivative of s with respect to t.This makes it a little bit clearerthat this itself is a function of time.And we know that this is the exact same thing as velocityas function of time, which we will write as v of t.So let's graph what v of t might look like down here.Let's graph it.So let me put another axis down here thatlooks pretty close to the original.I'll give myself some real estate,so that looks pretty good.And then let me try to graph v of t.So once again, if this is my y-axis, this is my t-axis,and I'm going to graph y is equal to v of t.And if this really is a parabola,then the slope over here is 0, the rate of change is 0,and then it keeps increasing.The slope gets steeper and steeper and steeper.And so v of t might look something like this.So this is the graph of y is equal to v of t.Now, using this graph, let's thinkif we can conceptualize the distance, or the changein position, between time a and between time b.Well, let's go back to our Riemann sums.Let's think about what an area of a very small rectanglewould represent.So let's divide this into a bunch of rectangles.So I'll do it fairly large rectanglesjust so we have some space to work with.You can imagine much smaller ones.And I'm going to do a left Riemann sum here,just because we've done those a bunch.But we could do it right Riemann sum.We could do a trapezoidal sum.We could do anything we want.And then we could keep going all the way-- actually,let me just do three right now.Let me just do three right over here.And so this is actually a very rough approximation,but you can imagine it might get closer.But what is the area of each of these rectanglestrying-- what is it an approximation for?Well, this one right over here, you have f of a,or actually I should say v of a.So your velocity at time a is the height right over here.And then this distance right over hereis a change in time, times delta t.So the area for that rectangle is your velocityat that moment times your change in time.What is the velocity at that momenttimes your change in time?Well, that's going to be your change in position.So this will tell you-- this is an approximationof your change in position over this time.Then the area of this rectangle is another approximationfor your change in position over the next delta t.And then, you can imagine, this right over hereis an approximation for your changein position for the next delta t.So if you really wanted to figure out your changein position between a and b, you mightwant to just do a Riemann sum if you wanted to approximate it.You would want to take the sum from i equals 1to i equals n of v of-- and I'll do a left Riemann sum,but once again, we could use a midpoint.We could do trapezoids.We could do the right Riemann sum.But I'll just do a left one, because that'swhat I depicted right here-- v of t of i minus 1.So this would be t0, would be a.So this is the first rectangle.So the first rectangle, you use the function evaluated at t0.For the second rectangle, you usethe function evaluated at t1.We've done this in multiple videos already.And then we multiply it times each of the changes in time.This will be an approximation for our total--and let me make it clear-- where delta t isequal to b minus a over the number of intervals we have.We already know, from many, many videoswhen we looked at Riemann sums, that thiswill be an approximation for two things.We just talked about it'll be an approximation for our changein position, but it's also an approximation for our area.So this right over here.So we're trying to approximate change in position.And this is also approximate of the area under the curve.So hopefully this satisfies you that if youare able to calculate the area under the curve-- and actually,this one's pretty easy, because it's a trapezoid.But even if this was a function, if it was a wacky function,it would still apply that when you'recalculating the area under the curve of the velocity function,you are actually figuring out the change in position.These are the two things.Well, we already know, what could wedo to get the exact area under the curve,or to get the exact change in position?Well, we just have a ton of rectangles.We take the limit as the number of rectangleswe have approaches infinity.We take the limit as n approaches infinity.And as n approaches infinity, because delta t isb minus a divided by n, delta t isgoing to become infinitely small.It's going to turn into dt, is one way to think about it.And we already have notation for this.This is one way to think about a Riemann integral.We just use the left Riemann sum.Once again, we could use the right Riemann sum, et cetera,et cetera.We could have used a more general Riemann sum,but this one will work.So this will be equal to the definite integralfrom a to b of v of t dt.So this right over here is one way of saying, look,if we want the exact area under the curve, of the velocitycurve, which is going to be the exact change in positionbetween a and b, we can denote it this way.It's the limit of this Riemann sum as n approaches infinity,or the definite integral from a to b of v of t dt.But what did we just figure out?So remember, this is the-- we could call thisthe exact change in position between times a and b.But we already figured out what the exact changein position between times a and b are.It's this thing right over here.And so this gets interesting.We now have a way of evaluating this definite integral.Conceptually, we knew that this wasthe exact change in position between a and b.But we already figured out a way to figure outthe exact change of position between a and b.So let me write all this down.We have that the definite integral between a and bof v of t dt is equal to s of b minus s of awhere-- let me write this in a new color-- where s of tis the-- we know v of t is the derivative of s of t,so we can say where s of t is the antiderivative of v of t.And this notion, although I've written itin a very nontraditional-- I've used position velocity--this is the second fundamental theorem of calculus.And you're probably wondering about the first.We'll talk about that in another video.But this is a super useful way of evaluatingdefinite integrals and finding the areaunder a curve, second fundamental theoremof calculus, very closely tied to the first fundamentaltheorem, which we won't talk about now.So why is this such a big deal?Well, let me write it in the more general notation,the way that you might be used to seeing itin your calculus book.It's telling us that if we want the areaunder the curve between two x points a and bof f of x-- and so this is how we would denotethe area under the curve between those two intervals.So let me draw that just to make it clearwhat I'm talking about in general terms.So this right over here could be f of x.And we care about the area under the curve between a and b.If we want to find the exact area under the curve,we can figure it out by taking the antiderivative of f.And let's just say that capital F of x is the antiderivative--or is an antiderivative, because you can have multiple thatare shifted by constants-- is an antiderivative of f.Then you just have to take-- evaluate-- the antiderivativeat the endpoints and take the difference.So you take the endpoint first.I guess you subtract the antiderivative evaluatedat the starting point from the antiderivative evaluatedat the end point.So you get capital F of b minus capital F of a.So if you want to figure out the exact area under the curve,you take the antiderivative of itand evaluate that at the endpoint,and from that, you subtract the starting point.So hopefully, that makes sense.In the next few videos, we'll actually apply it.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-differential-equations-introduction/v/differential-equation-introduction	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's now introduce ourselvesto the idea of a differential equation.And as we'll see, differential equationsare super useful for modeling and simulatingphenomena and understanding how they operate.But we'll get into that later.For now let's just think about or at least look atwhat a differential equation actually is.So if I were to write, so let's see here is an exampleof differential equation, if I were to write thatthe second derivative of y plus two timesthe first derivative of y is equal to three times y,this right over here is a differential equation.Another way we could write it if we saidthat y is a function of x, we could write thisin function notation.We could write the second derivative of our functionwith respect to x plus two times the first derivativeof our function is equal to three times our function.Or if we wanted to use the Leibniz notation,we could also write, the second derivative of ywith respect to x plus two times the first derivativeof y with respect to x is equal to three times y.All three of these equations are really representingthe same thing, they're saying OK, can I find functionswhere the second derivative of the functionplus two times the first derivative of the functionis equal to three times the function itself.So just to be clear, these are all essentiallysaying the same thing.And you might have just caught from how I described itthat the solution to a differential equationis a function, or a class of functions.It's not just a value or a set of values.So the solution here, so the solutionto a differential equation is a function,or a set of functions, or a class of functions.It's important to contrast this relativeto a traditional equation.So let me write that down.So a traditional equation, maybe I shouldn't saytraditional equation, differential equationshave been around for a while.So let me write this as maybe an algebraic equationthat you're familiar with.An algebraic equation might look something like,and I'll just write up a simple quadratic.Say x squared plus three x plus two is equal to zero.The solutions to this algebraic equationare going to be numbers, or a set of numbers.We can solve this, it's going to be x plus twotimes x plus one is equal to zero.So x could be equal to negative two or x couldbe equal to negative one.The solutions here are numbers, or a set of valuesthat satisfy the equation.Here it's a relationship between a functionand its derivatives.And so the solutions, or the solution,is going to be a function or a set of functions.Now let's make that a little more tangible.What would a solution to something like any of these three,which really represent the same thing,what would a solution actually look like?Actually let me move this over a little bit.Move this over a little bit.So we can take a look at what someof these solutions could look like.Let me erase this a little.This little stuff that I have right over here.So I'm just gonna give you examples of solutions here.We'll verify that these indeed are solutionsfor I guess this is really just one differential equationrepresented in different ways.But you'll hopefully appreciate what a solutionto a differential equation looks like.And that there is often more than one solution.There's a whole class of functions that could be a solution.So one solution to this differential equation,and I'll just write it as our first one.So one solution, I'll call it y one.And I could even write it as y one of xto make it explicit that it is a function of x.One solutions is y one of x is equal to eto the negative three x.And I encourage you to pause this video right nowand find the first derivative of y one,and the second derivative of y one, and verify that it doesindeed satisfy this differential equation.So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.So let's work through this together.So that's y one.So the first derivative of y one,so we just have to do the chain rule here,the derivative of negative three x with respect to xis just negative three.And the derivative of e to the negative three xwith respect to negative three x is just eto the negative three x.And if we take the second derivative of y one,this is equal to the same exact idea,the derivative of this is three times negative threeis going to be nine e to the negative three x.And now we could just substitute these valuesinto the differential equation, or these expressionsinto the differential equation to verify that thisis indeed going to be true for this function.So let's verify that.So we first have the second derivative of y.So that's that term right over there.So we have nine e to the negative three xplus two times the first derivative.So that's going to be two times this right over here.So it's going to be minus six, I'll just writeplus negative six e to the negative three x.Notice I just took this two times the first derivative.Two times the first derivative is going to be equal to,or needs to be equal to, if this indeed does satisfy,if y one does indeed satisfy the differential equation,this needs to be equal to three times y.Well three times y is three times e to the negative three x.Three e to the negative three x.Let's see if that indeed is true.So these two terms right over here,nine e to the negative three x,essentially minus six e to the negative three x,that's gonna be three e to the negative three x.Which is indeed equal to three e to the negative three x.So y one is indeed a solution to this differential equation.But as we'll see, it is not the only solutionto this differential equation.For example, let's say y two is equal to e to the xis also a solution to this differential equation.And I encourage you to pause the video againand verify that it's a solution.So assuming you've had a go at it.So the first derivative of this is pretty straight-forward,is e to the x.Second derivative, one of the profound thingsof the exponential function, the second derivative hereis also e to the x.So the second derivative, let me just do itin those same colors.So the second derivative is going to be e to the xplus two times e to the xis indeed going to be equal to three times e to the x.This is absolutely going to be true.E to the x plus two e to the x is three e to the x.So y two is also a solution to this differential equation.So that's a start.In the next few videos, we'll explore this more.We'll start to see what the solutions look like,what classes of solutions are,techniques for solving them,visualizing solutions to differential equations,and a whole toolkit for kind of digging in deeper.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-differential-equations-introduction/v/writing-a-differential-equation	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Particle moves along a straight line.Its speed is inversely proportionalto the square of the distance, S, it has traveled.Which equation describes this relationship?So I'm not even gonna look at these choices,and I'm just gonna try to parse the sentence up hereand see if we can come up with an equation.So they tell us its speed is inversely proportional,to what?To the square of the distance, S, it has traveled.So Sis equal to distance.S is equal to distance.And how would we denote speed then,if S is distance?Well speed is the rate of change of distancewith respect to time.So our speed would bethe rate of distance with respect to time.The rate of change of distance with respect to time.So this is going to be our speed.So now that we got our notation,S is the distance,the derivative of S with respect to time is speed.We can say the speed which is d,capital S,dt,is inversely proportional.So it's inversely proportional,I wrote a proportionality constant,over what?It's inversely proportional to what?To the square of the distance!To the square of the distance it has traveled.So there you go,this is an equation that I thinkis describing a differential equation,really that's describing what we have up here.Now let's see,let's see what,which of these choices match that.Well actually this one is exactly what we wrote.The speed,the rate of change of distance with respect to time,is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.Now just to make sure we understand these other ones,let's just interpret them.This is saying that the distance,which is a function of time,is inversely proportional to the time squared.That's not what they told us.This is saying that the distanceis inversely proportional to the distance squared.That one is especially strange.And this is saying that the distance with respect to time,the change in distance with respect to time,the derivative of the distance with respect to time,dS/dt or the speed,is inversely proportionaltotime squared.Well that's not what they said,they said it's inversely proportionalto the square of the distance it has traveled.So we like that choice.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-verifying-solutions-for-differential-equations/v/verifying-solutions-to-differential-equations	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So let's write down a differential equation,the derivative of y with respect to xis equal to four y over x.And what we'll see in this video is the solutionto a differential equation isn't a valueor a set of values.It's a function or a set of functions.But before we go about actually trying to solve thisor figure out all of the solutions,let's test whether certain equations,certain functions,are solutions to this differential equation.So for example,if I have y is equal to four x,is this a solution to this differential equation?Pause the video and see if you can figure it out.Well to see if this is a solution,what we have to do is figure out the derivative of ywith respect to x and see is that truly equalto four times y over x.And I'm gonna try to express everything in terms of xto see if I really have an equality there.So first let's figure out the derivative of ywith respect to x.Well that's just going to be equal to four.We've seen that many times before.And so what we need to test is,is four, the derivative of y with respect to x,equal to four times, I could write y,but instead of y let's write four x.I'm gonna put everything in terms of x.So y is equal to four x,so instead of four y I could write four times four x,all of that over x.Is this true?Well that x cancels with that and I'm gonna getfour is equal to 16, which it clearly is not.And so this is not a solution.Not a solutionto our differential equation.Let's look at another equation.What about y is equal to x to the fourth power?Pause this video and see if this is a solutionto our original differential equation.Well we're going to do the same thing.What's the derivative of y with respect to x?This is equal to, just using the power rule,four x to the third power.And so what we have to test is,is four x to the third power,that's the derivative of y with respect to x,equal to four times y,instead of writing a y I'm gonna write it all in terms of x,so is that equal to four times x to the fourth,because x to the fourth is the same thing as y,divided by x?And so let's see, x to the fourth divided by x,that is going to be x to the third.And so you will indeed get four x to the thirdis equal to four x to the third.So check, this is a solution.So is a solution.It's not necessarily the only solution,but it is a solution to that differential equation.Let's look at another differential equation.Let's say that I had,and I'm gonna write it with different notation,f prime of x is equal tof of x minus x.And the first function that I wanna test,let's say I have f of x is equal to two x.Is this a solution to this differential equation?Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out.Well to figure that out,you have to say well what is f prime of x?f prime of x is just going to be equal to two.And then test the equality.Is two, is f prime of x, equal to f of x,which is two x, minus x,minus x?And so let's see we are going to get two is equal to x.So you might be tempted to say oh heyI just solved for x or something like that.But this would tell you that this is not a solutionbecause this needs to be true for any xthat is in the domain of this function.And so this is, I'll just put an x there,or I'll put a incorrect there to say not,not a, not a solution.Just to be clear again,this needs, in order for a function to be a solutionof this differential equation,it needs to work for any xthat you can put into the function.Let's look at another one.Let's say that we have f of x is equal to x plus one.Pause the video and see, is this a solutionto our differential equation?Well same drill.f prime of x is going to be equal to one.And so we have to see is f prime of x,which is equal to one, is it equal to f of x,which is x plus one, x plus one, minus x?And so here, you see no matter what x is,this equation is going to be true.So this is a solution,is a solution.Let's do a few more of these.Let me scroll down little bit so I have a little bit more,a little bit more space,but make sure we see our original differential equation.Let's test whether, I'm gonna do it in a red color,let's test whether f of xequals e to the x plus x plus oneis a solution to this differential equation.Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out.All right well let's figure out the derivative here.f prime of x is going to be equal to,derivative of e to the x with respect to x is e to the x,which I always find amazing.And so and then plus one and the derivative of thiswith respect to x is just zero.And then let's substitute thisinto our original differential equation.So f prime of x is e to the x plus one.Is that equal to f of x,which is e to the x plus x plus one, minus x, minus x?And if that x cancels out with that x,it is indeed, they are indeed equal.So this is also a solution.So this, this is a solution.And we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-sketching-slope-fields/v/creating-a-slope-field	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's say that we havethe differential equation dy dx or the derivativeof y with respect to x is equal to negative x over y.Let's say we don't know how to find the solutions to this,but we at least want to get a senseof what the solutions might look like.And to do that what we could do is we could lookat a coordinate plane, so let me draw some axes here.So let me draw relatively straight line alright.So that's my y-axis and this is my x-axis.Let me mark this as one, that's two, that's negative one,negative two, one, two, negative one, and negative two.And what I could do is since this differential equationis just in terms of xs and ys and first derivativesof y with respect to x, I could sample points on thecoordinate plane, I could look at the x and y coordinatessubstitute them in here, figure outwhat the slope is going to be.And then I could visualize the slope if a solutiongoes through that point what the slope needs to be thereand I can visualize that with a line segment,a little small line segment that hasthe same slope as the slope in question.So let's actually do that.So let me setup a little table here.I'm going to do a little table hereto do a bunch of x and y values.Once again I'm just sampling some pointson the coordinate plane to be able to visualize.So x, y and this is dy dx.So let's say when x is zero and y is one,what is the derivative of y with respect to x?It's going to be negative zero over oneso it's just going to be zero.And so at the point zero one if a solution goes throughthis point its slope is going to be zero.And so we can visualize that by doing a littlehorizontal line segment right there.So let's keep going.What about when x is one and y is one?Well then dy dx, the derivative of y with respect to xis negative one over one, so it's going to be negative one.So at the point one comma one if a solution goesthrough that point, it would have a slope of negative one.And so I draw a little line segmentthat has a slope of negative one.Let me do this in a new color.What about when x is one and y is zero?Well then it's negative one over zero,so this is actually undefined, but it's a cluethat maybe the slope there if you had a tangent lineat that point, maybe it's vertical.So I'll put that as a question mark, vertical there.So maybe it's something like that if you actuallydid have, I guess it wouldn't be a function,if you had some kind of relation that went through it,but let's not draw that just yet.But let's try some other points.Let's try the point negative one negative one.So now we have negative negative one,which is one, over negative one.Well you'd have a slope of negative one here.So negative one negative oneyou'd have a slope of negative one.What about if you had one negative one?Well now it's negative one overnegative one, your slope is now one.So one negative one, if a solution goes through thisits slope would look like that.And we could keep going, we could even do two negative two.That's going to have a slope of one as well.If you did positive two positive two,that would be negative two over two.You'd have a slope of negative one right over here.And so we could do a bunch of points, just keep going.Now I'm just doing them in my head,I'm not going on the table.But you get a sense of what's going on here.Here you're slope, what if it was negative one one?It's going to have a slope of one.So at this point your slope negative one oneso negative negative one is one over one,so you're going to have a slope like that.At negative two two same exact idea,it would look like that.And so when you keep drawing these line segmentsover these kind of sample points in the cartesianor in the x-y plane, you start to get a sense ofwell what would a solution have to do.And you can start to visualize that hey maybe a solutionwould have to do something like this.This would be a solution, so maybe it wouldhave to do something like this.Or if we're looking only at functions and not relationsI'll make it so it's very clear.So maybe it would have to do something like this.Or if the function started here based on what we'veseen so far maybe it would have to do something like this.Or if this were a point on the function over here,it would have to do something like this.And once again I'm doing this based onwhat the slope field is telling me.So this field that I'm creating where I'm samplinga bunch of points and I'm visualizingthe slope with a line segement.Once again this is called a slope field.So hopefully that gives you kind ofthe basic idea of what a slope field is.And the next two videos we'll explore this idea even deeper.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-sketching-slope-fields/v/differential-equation-from-slope-field	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We've already seen scenarioswhere we start with a differential equationand then we generate a slope fieldthat describes the solutions to the differential equationand then we use that to visualize those solutions.What I want to do in this video is do an exercisethat takes us the other way, start with a slope fieldand figure out which differential equationis the slope field describing the solutions for.And so I encourage you to look at each of these optionsand think about which of these differential equationsis being described by this slope field.I encourage you to pause the video right nowand try it on your own.So I'm assuming you have had a go at it.So let's work through each of them.And the way I'm going to do it is I'm just going to findsome points that seem to be easy to do arithmetic with,and we'll see if the slope described by the differentialequation at that point is consistent with the slopedepicted in the slope field.And, I don't know, just for simplicity,maybe I'll do x equals one andy equals one for all of these.So, when x equals one and y is equal to one.So, this first differential equation right over here,if x is one and y is one, then dy/dx would benegative one over one or negative one.Dy/dx would be negative one.Now, is that depicted here?When x is equal to one and y is equal to one,our slope isn't negative one.Our slope here looks positive.So we can rule this one out.Now, let's try the next one.So, if x is equal to one and y is equal to one,well then dy/dx would be equal to one minus one or zero.And, once again, I just picked x equals oneand y equals one for convenience.I could have picked any other.I could have picked negative five and negative seven.This just makes the arithmetic a little easier.Once again, when you look at that pointthat we've already looked at,our slope is clearly not zero.We have a positive slope here, so we can rule that out.Once again, for this magenta differential equation,if x and y are both equal to one,then one minus one is once again going to be equal to zero.And we've already seen this slope is not zero here,so rule that one out.And now here we have x plus y,so when x is one and y is one,our derivate of y with respect to x is going to beone plus one, which is equal to two.Now, this looks interesting.It looks like this slope right over here could be two.This looks like one.This looks like two.I would want to validate some other points,but this looks like a really, really good candidate.And you can also see what is happening here.When dy/dx is equal to x plus y,you would expect that as x increases for a given yyour slope would increaseand as y increases for a given x your slope increases.And we see that.If we were to just hold y constant at onebut increase x along this line,we see that the slope is increasing.It is getting steeper.And if we were to keep x constantand increase y across this line,we see that the slope increases.And, in general, we see that the slope increasesas we go to the top right.And we see that it decreases as we go to the bottom leftand both x and y become much, much more negative.So, I'm feeling pretty good about this,especially if we can knock this one out here,if we can knock that one out.So, dy/dx is equal to x over y.Well, then when x equals one and y equals one,dy/dx would be equal to one,and this slope looks larger than one.It looks like two, but sincewe are really just eyeballing it,let's see if we can find somethingwhere this more clearly falls apart.So, let's look at the situationwhen they both equal negative one.So, x equals negative one and y is equal to negative one.Well, in that case, dy/dx should still be equal to onebecause you have negative one over one.Do we see that over here?So, when x is equal to negative one,y is equal to negative one.Our derivative here looks negative.It looks like negative two,which is consistent with this yellow differential equation.The slope here is definitely not a positive one,so we could rule this one out as well.And so we should feel pretty confidentthat this is the differential equation being described.And now that we've done it, we can actually think aboutwell, okay, what are the solutionsfor this differential equation going to look like.Well, it depends where they startor what points they contain.If you have a solution that contains that point,it looks like it might do something like this.If you had a solution that contained this point,it might do something like that.And, of course, it keeps going.It looks like it would asymptote towardsy is equal to negative x, this downward sloping.This essentially is the line y is equal to negative x.Actually, no that is not the line y equals negative x.This is the line y is equal to negative x minus one,so that's this line right over here.And it looks like if the solution contained,say, this point right over here,that would actually be a solution tothe differential equation y is equal to negative x minus oneand you can verify that.If y is equal to negative x minus one,then the x and negative x cancel outand you are just left with dy/dx is equal to negative one,which is exactly what is beingdescribed by this slope field.Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-sketching-slope-fields/v/example-of-steps-for-constructing-slope-field	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] In drawing the slope field for thedifferential equation, the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to y minus 2x,I would place short line segmentsat select points on the xy-plane.Complete the sentences.At the point (-1,1) I would drawa short segment of slope blank,and like always pause this video and see if you canfill out these three blanks.The short segments that you're trying to drawto construct this slope field,you figure out their slope based on thedifferential equation so you're saying whenx is equal to -1 and y is equal to 1,what is the derivative of y with respect to x,and that's what this differential equation tells us.So for this first case, the derivative of y with respectto x is going to be equal to y, which is 1 - 2 times x,x is negative 1,so this is going to be -2 but you're subtracting itso it's gonna be +2,so the derivative of y with respect to x at this pointis going to be 3, so I would draw a short line segmentor a short segment of slope 3,and we keep going, at the point (0,2).Well let's see, when x is 0 and y is 2the derivative of y with respect to x is goingto be equal to y which is 2 - 2 times 0,well that's just going to be 2.And then last but not least, for this third pointthe derivative of y with respect to x is going tobe equal to y which is 3 - 2 times x, x here is 2,2 times 2, 3 - 4 is equal to -1,and that's all that problem asks us to do,now if we actually had to do it, it would looksomething like, I'll try to draw it real fast,so let's see, let me make sure I havespace for all of these points here,so that's my coordinate axisand I want to get the point (0,2),actually I want to go all the way to (2,3)so let me get some space here,so 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 2, 3,and then we have to go -1 and once we might goright over here, and so for this first one,this exercise isn't asking us to do it but I'm justmaking it very clear how we would construct the slope field,so the point (-1,1), a short segment of slope 3,so slope 3 would look something like that,then at the point (0,2) a slope of 2,(0,2), the slope is going to be 2 which looks somethinglike that, and then at the point (2,3),at (2,3), a short segment of slope -1,so (2,3) a slope segment of slope -1,it would look something like that,and you would keep doing this at more and more points,if you had a computer to do it that's what the computerwould do, and you would draw these short line segmentsto indicate what the derivative is at those pointsand you get a sense of, I guess you would saythe solution space for that differential equation.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-reasoning-using-slope-fields/v/slope-field-to-visualize-solutions	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] So we have the differential equation,the derivative of y with respect to xis equal to y over six times four minus y.And what we have plotted right over hereis the slope field or a slope fieldfor this differential equation and we can verifythat this indeed is a slope fieldfor this differential equation,let's draw a little table here,so let's just verify a few points,so let's say x, y, and dy/dx.So let's say we start with, I don't know,let's start with this point right over here, one comma one,when x is one, and y is one, well when I look atthe differential equation, 1/6 times four minus one,so it's 1/6 times three, which is 3/6,which is 1/2, and we see indeed on the slope field,they depicted the slope there if a solution goesto that point, right at that point, its slope would be 1/2.And as you see, it's actually only dependent on the y-value,it doesn't matter what x is as long as y is one,dy/dx is going to be 1/2, and you see that's whywhen x is 1 1/2, and y is one, you still have a slope of 1/2and as long as y is one, all of these sampled pointsright over here, all have a slope of 1/2,so that, just looking at that, that makes us feelthat this slope field is consistentwith this differential equation, but let's try a fewother points just to feel a little bit better about it,and then we will use a slope fieldto actually visualize some solutions.So let's say, let's do an interesting point,let's say we have this point, actually no,that's at a half point, let's say we havethis, let's see, let's say we do this point right over here,so that's x is equal to one, and y is equal to six,and we see the way the differential equationis defined, it doesn't matter what our x is,it's really dependent on the y that's goingto drive the slope, but we have 6/6, which is one,times four minus six, which is negative two.So it's negative two, so we shouldhave a slope of negative two and itlooks like that's what they depicted, so as long asy is six, we should have a slope of negative two.Have a slope of negative two,and you see that in the slope field.So hopefully you feel pretty good that thisis the slope field for this differential equation,if you don't, I encourage you to keep verifyingthese points here, but now let's actually usethe slope field, let's actually use this,to visualize solutions to this differential equationbased on points that the solution might go through.So let's say that we have a solutionthat goes through this point right over here.So what is that solution likely to look like?And once again this is going to be a rough approximation,well right at that point it's goingto have a slope just as the slope field shows,and as our y increases, it looks like our slope,it looks like our slope...so at this point I should be, actuallylet me undo that, so if I keep going up at this pointwhen y is equal to two I should be parallelto all of these segments on the slope fieldthat y is equal to two, and then it looks likethe slope starts to decrease as we approachy is equal to four, and so if I had a solutionthat went through this point,my guess is that would look something,and then now the slope decreases againas we approach y is equal to zero.And of course we see that, because if when y equals zerothis whole thing is zero so ourderivative is going to be zero.So, a reasonable solution mightlook something like this, so this gives us a clueof, look, if a solution goes through this point,this right over here might be what it looks like.But what if it goes through, I don't know,what if it goes through this point right over here?Well then, it might look like...It might look like this by the same exact logic.So it might look like this, so just like that,we're trying to get a sense, we don't know theactual solution for this differential equation,but we're starting to get a sense of whattype of functions or the class of functions,that might satisfy the differential equation.But, what's interesting about this slope field,is it looks like there's some interesting stuffif our solution includes points betweenwhere the y value is between zero and four,it looks like we're going to have solutions like this,but what if we had y-values that were larger than thator that were less than that, or exactly zero or four?So for example, what if we had a solution thatwent through this point right over here?Well, that point right over here, the slope fieldtells us that our slope is zero.So our y-value is not going to change,and as long as our y-value doesn't change,our y-value is going to stay at four,so our slope is going to stay at zero,so we actually already found this is actuallya solution to the differential equation, y is equalto four is a solution to this differential equation.So, y is equal to four, and you can verify thatthat is a solution, when y is equal to four,this right-hand side is going to be zero,and the derivative is zero for y is equal to four.So that is a solution to the differential equation.And the same thing for y is equal to zero.That is also a solution to the differential equation.Now what if we included points,what if we included this point up here,and actually, let me do it in a different color,so that you could see it, let's say oursolution included that point.Well then it might look something like this,and once again, I'm just using the slope fieldas a guide to give me an idea of what the slopemight be as my curve progresses, as my solution progresses.So solution that includes the point zero five,might look something like this,and once again, it's just another clue.A solution that includes the point zero negative 1 1/2,might look something like...might look something like this.So anyway, hopefully this gives you a better appreciationfor why slope fields are interesting.If you have a differential equationthat just involves the first derivative,and some x's and y's, this one only involvesthe first derivative and y's.We can plot a slope field like this,not too much trouble if we essentially just keep solvingfor the slopes, and then we can use that slope fieldto get a conceptual or visual understandingof what the solutions might look likegiven points that the solutions might actually contain.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-reasoning-using-slope-fields/v/range-of-solution-curve-from-slope-field	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] If the initial condition is zero comma six,what is the range of the solution curve y is equal to f of xfor x is greater than or equal to zero?So we have a slope field here, for a differential equation.And we're saying, okay, if we have a solutionwhere the initial condition is zero comma six,so zero comma six is part of that solution.So let's see, zero comma six,so this is part of the solution.And we want to know the range of the solution curve.So solution curve, you can eyeball a little bitby looking at the slope field.So as x,remember, x is gonna be greater than or equal to zero,so it's going to include this point right over here.And as x increases, you can tell from the slope,okay, y is gonna decrease,but it's gonna keep decreasing at a slower and slower rate.And it looks like it's asymptotingtowards the line y is equal to four.So it's gonna get really,as x gets larger and larger, larger,it's gonna get infinitely close to y is equal to four,but it's not quite gonna get there.So the range, the y-values that this is going to take on,y is going to be greater than four.It's never gonna be equal to four.So I'll do, it's going to be greater than four.That's gonna be the bottom end of my range.And at the top end of my range, I will be equal to six.Six is the largest value that I am going to take on.Another way I could have written this is four is less thany is less than or equal to six.Either way, this is a way of describing the range.The y-values that the solution will take onfor x being greater than or equal to zero.If they said for all x's,well, then you might have been able to go back this wayand keep going.But they're saying the range of the solution curvefor x is greater than or equal to zero.So we won't consider those values of x less than zero.So there you go, the curve would look something like that.And you can see, the highest value it takes on is six,and it actually does take on that value'cause we're including x equaling zero.And then it keeps going down, approaching four,getting very, very close to four,but never quite equaling four.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-separation-of-variables/v/separable-differential-equations-introduction	khanacademy	video	:00- [voiceover] So now that we've spent some timethinking about what a differential equation isand even visualizing solutionsto a differential equations using things like slope field,let's start seeing if we can actuallysolve differential equations.As we'll see, different types of differential equationsmight require different techniquesand some of them we might not be ableto solve at all using analytic techniques.We'd have to resort to numeric techniques to estimate the solutions.But let's go to what I would argueas the simplest form of differential equation to solveand that's what's called a Separable.Separable differential equation.And we will see in a second why it is calleda separable differential equation.So let's say that we have the derivative of Ywith respect to X is equal to negative X over Y E to the X squared.So we have this differential equationand we want to find the particular solutionthat goes through the point 0,1.I encourage you to pause this and I'll give you a hint.If you can on one side of this equation through algebraseparate out the Ys and the DYsand on the other side have all the Xs and DXs,and then integrate.Perhaps you can find the particular solutionto this differential equationthat contains this point.Now if you can't do it don't worrybecause we're about to work through it.So like I said, let's use a little bit of algebrato get all the Ys and DYs on one sideand all the Xs and DXs on the other side.So one way, let's say I want to get all the Ysand DYs on the left hand side,and all the Xs and DXs on the right hand side.Well, I can multiply both sides times Y.So I can multiply both sides times Ythat has the effect of putting the Ys on the left hand sideand then I can multiple both sides times DX.I can multiple both sides times DXand we kind of treat,you can treat these differentialsas you would treat a variablewhen you're manipulating it to essentially separate out the variables.And so, this will cancel with that.And so, we are left with Y, DY.Y, DY is equal to negative X.And actually let me write it this way. Let me write it as negative X, E.Actually, I might need a little more space.So negative X E to the negative X squared DX.DX. Now why is this interesting?Because we could integrate both sides.And now this also highlightswhy we call it the separable. You won't be able to do thiswith every differential equation.You won't be able to algebraicallyseparate the Ys and DYs on one sideand the Xs and DXs on the other side. But this one we were able to.And so that's why this is calleda separable differential equation.Differential equation.And it's usually the first technique that you should try.Hey, can I separate the Ys and the Xsand as I said, this is not going to be trueof many, if not most differential equations.But now that we did thiswe can integrate both sides.So let's do that.So, I'll find a nice color to integrate with.So, I'm going to integrate both sides.Now if you integrate the left hand side what do you get?You get and remember, we're integratingwith respect to Y here.So this is going to be Y squared over two and we could put some constant there.I could call that plus C one.And if you're integrating thatthat's going to be equal to.Now the right hand side we're integratingwith respect to X. And let's see, you could do U substitutionor you could recognize that look,the derivative of negative X squared is going to be negative two X.So if that was a two thereand if you don't want to change the value of the integralyou put the 1/2 right over there. And so now you could either doU substitution explicitlyor you could do it in your headwhere you said U is equal to negative X squaredand then DU will be negative to X, DXor you can kind of do this in your head at this point.So I have something and it's derivativeso I really could just integrate with respect tothat something too with respect to that U.So this is going to be 1/2.This 1/2 right over here.The anti-derivative.This is E to the negative X squaredand then of course, I might have some other constant.I'll just call that C two.And once again, if this part over herewhat I just did seemed strange,the U substitution,you might want to review that piece.Now, what can I do here?We'll have a constant on the left hand side.It's an arbitrary constant.We don't know what it is.I haven't used this initial condition yetwe could call it.So, let me just subtract C one from both sides.So if I just subtract C one from both sidesI have an arbitrary so this is gonna cancel,and I have C two, sorry.Let me. So, this is C one.So these are going to canceland C two minus C one.These are both constants, arbitrary constantsand we don't know what they are yet. And so, we could just rewrite this ason the left hand side we have Y squared over twois equal to on the right hand side.I'll write 1/2 E.Let me write that in bluejust because I wrote it in blue before.1/2 E to the negative X squared and I'll just say C two minus C one.Let's just call that C.So if you take the sum of those two things let's just call that C.And so now, this is kind of a general solution.We don't know what this constant isand we haven't explicitly solved for Y yetbut even in this formwe can now find a particular solutionusing this initial condition.Let me separate it out.This was a part of thisoriginal expression right over herebut using this initial condition.So, it tells us when X is zero, Y needs to be equal to one.So we would have one squared which is just oneover two is equal to 1/2. E to the negative zero squared.Well, that's just going to bee to the zero is just one. This is gonna be 1/2 plus Cand just like that we're able to figure outif you subtract 1/2 from both sidesC is equal to zero. So the relationship between Y and Xthat goes through this point,we could just set C is equal to zero.So that's equal to zero.That's zero right over there. And so we are left with Y squared over twois equal to E to the negative X squared over two.Now we can multiply both sides by twoand we're going to get Y squared.Y squared.Let me do that.So we're gonna get Y squaredis equal to E to the negative X squared.Now, we can take the square root of both sidesand you can say, well look,you know, Y squared is equal to thisso Y could be equal to the plus or minus square rootof E to the negative X squared.Of E to the negative X squared.But they gave us an initial condition where Y is actually positive.So we're finding the particular solutionthat goes through this point.That means Y is gonna be the positive square root.If this was a point zero negative onethen we would say Y is the negative square rootbut we know that Y is the positive square root,it's the principal root right over there.So let me do that a little bit neater so we can get rid of, whoops.I thought I was writing in black.So we can get rid of this right over here.We're only going to be dealing with the positive square rootso we could write Y is equal to Eto the negative X squared to the 1/2 powerand that of course is equal toE to the negative X squared over two.So this right over here isor Y equals E to the negative X squared over twois a particular solutionthat satisfies the initial conditionsto this original differential equation.So just like that.Because we were able to just as a review,because this differential equation was setup in a wayor because we could algebraicallyseparate the Y, DYs from the Xs, DXs,we're able to just separate them out algebraically,integrate both sidesand use the information given in the initial conditionto find the particular solution.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-separation-of-variables/v/addressing-treating-differentials-algebraically	khanacademy	video	":00- [Instructor] So when you first learn calculus,you learn that the derivative of some function f,could be written as f prime of x is equalto the limit as, then there's multiple waysof doing this, the change in x approaches zeroof f of x plus our change in x, minus f of x,over our change in x.And you learn multiple notations for this.For example, if you that y is equal f of x,you might write this as y prime.You might write this as d-y, d-x,which you'll often hear me say is the derivative of y,with respect to x, and that you can dothe derivative of f with respect to xbecause y is equal to our function.But then later on when you, especially when youstart getting into differential equations,you see people start to treat this notationas an actual algebraic expression.For example, you will learn or you might have already seen.If you're trying to solve the differential equation,the derivative of y with respect to x, is equal to y.So the rate of change of y with respect to xis equal to the value of y itself.This is one of, the most basic differential equationsyou might see.You'll see this technique, where people just say,""Well, let's just multiply both sides by d-x.""Just treating d-x like as if it's some algebraic expression.So you multiply both sides by d-x and then you have,so that would cancel out algebraically,and so you see people treat it like that.So you have d-y is equal to y times d-x,and then they'll say, ""Okay let's divide both sides by y.""Which is a reasonable thing to do.Y is an algebraic expression.So if you divide both sides by y, you get one over y,d-y is equal to d-x.And then folks will integrate both sidesto find a general solution to this differential equation.But my point on this video isn't to thinkabout how do you solve a differential equation here,but to think about this notion of using,what we call differentials.So a d-x, or a d-y,and treating them algebraically like this.Treating them as algebraic expressions,where I can just multiply both sides by just d-x or d-y,or divide both sides by d-x or d-y.And I don't normally say this, but the rigor you needto show that this is okay in this situation,is not an easy thing to say.And so to just feel reasonably okay about doing this,this is a little bit hand wavy,it's not super mathematically rigorous.But it has proven to be a useful tool for us,to find these solutions.And conceptually the way that I think about a d-y, ora d-x, is this is the super small change in y,in response to a super small change in x.And that's essentially what this definitionof the limit is telling us.Especially as Delta x approaches zero,we're going to have a super small change in x,as Delta x approaches zero.And then we're going to have a resultingsuper small change in y.So that's one way that you can feela little bit better, of...And this is actually one of the justificationsfor this type of notation.As you can view this, what's the resulting super small,or what's the super small change in y,for a given super small change in x?Which is giving us the sense of what's the limiting valueof the slope?As we go from the slopeof the secant line to a tangent line?And if you view it that way you might feela little bit better about using the differentials,or creating them algebraically.Let me just multiply both sides bythat super small change in x.So the big picture is, this is a techniquethat you'll often see,in introductory differential equations classes.Introductory multi-variable classes andintroductory calculus classes.But it's not very mathematically rigorous,to just treat differentials like algebraic expressions.But even thought it's not very mathematicallyrigorous to do it willy nilly like that.It has proven to be very useful.Now as you get more sophisticatedin your mathematics there are rigorous definitionsof a differential.Where you can get a better sense of whereit is mathematically rigorous to use itand where it isn't.But the whole point here is, if you felta little weird feeling about multiplyingboth sides by d-x or dividing both sides by d-x or d-y.Your feeling was mathematically justified,because it's not a very rigorous thing to do.At least until you have more rigor behind it,but I will tell you that if you'rean introductory student it is a reasonable thingto do as you explore and manipulatesome of these basic differential equations."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-separation-of-variables/v/separable-differential-equations-examples	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're gonna be doing in this videois get some practice finding general solutions toseparable differential equations.So let's say that I had the differential equation DY, DX,the derivative of Y with respect to X, is equal toE to the X, over Y.See if you can find the general solution tothis differential equation.I'm giving you a huge hint.It is a separable differential equation.All right, so when we're dealing witha separable differential equation, what we wanna dois get the Ys and the DYs on one side, and thenthe Xs and the DXs on the other side.And we really treat these differentials kind oflike variables, which is a little hand-wavywith the mathematics.But that's what we will do.So let's see. If we multiply both sides times Y,so we're gonna multiply both sides times Y,what are we going to get?We're gonna get Y times a derivative of Y,with respect to X, is equal to E to the X,and now we can multiply both sides by the differential,DX; multiply both of them by DX; those cancel out.And we are left with Y times DY is equal to E to the X, DX.And now we can take the integral of both sides.So let us do that.So what is the integral of Y, DY?Well here we would just use the reverse power rule.We would increment the exponent, so it's Y to the first,but so now when we take the anti-derivative,it will be Y squared, and then we divide by thatincremented exponent, is equal to, wellthe exciting thing about E to the X is that it'santi-derivative, and its derivative, is E to the X,is equal to E to the X, plus is equal to E to the Xplus C.And so we can leave it like this if we like.In fact this right over here is, this isn'tan explicit function.Y here isn't an explicit function of X.We could actually say Y is equal to the plus or minussquare root of two times all of this business,but this would be a pretty general relationship,which would satisfy this separable differential equation.Let's do another example.So let's say that we have the derivative of Ywith respect to X is equal to, let's say it's equal toY squared times sine of X.Pause the video and see if you can findthe general solution here.So once again, we wanna separate our Ys and our Xs.So let's see, we can multiply both sides timesY to the negative two power, Y to the negative two,Y to the negative two, these become one,and then we could also multiply both sides times DX.So if we multiply DX here, those cancel out, and thenwe multiply DX here, and so we're left withY to the negative two power times DY is equal tosine of X, DX, and now we just can integrate both sides.Now what is the anti-derivative of Y to the negative two?Well, once again we use the reverse power rule.We increment the exponents, so it's gonna be Yto the negative one, and then we divide by thatnewly incremented exponent.So we divide by negative one.Well that would just make this think negative.That is going to be equal to...So, what's the anti-derivative of sine of X?Well, it is, you might recognize it ifI put a negative there, and a negative there.The anti-derivative of negative sine of X,well that's cosine of X.So this whole thing is gonna be negative cosine of X,or another way to write this: I could multiply both sidestimes a negative one, and so these wouldboth become positive, and so I could writeone over Y is equal to cosine of X, and actuallylet me write it this way, plus C; don't wannaforget my plus Cs.Plus C, or I could take the reciprocal of both sidesif I wanna solve explicitly for Y, I could get Yis equal to one over cosine of X plus Cas our general solution.And we're done.That was strangely fun.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-separation-of-variables/v/identifying-separable-equations	khanacademy	video	:00- [Sal] Which of the differential equations are separable?And I encourage you to pause this videoand see which of these are actually separable.Now, the way that I approach thisis I try to solve for the derivative,and if when I solve for the derivative,if I get dy, dxis equal to some function of ytimes some other function of xthen I say okay, this is separable.'Cause I could rewrite this as,I could divide both sides by g of y,and I get one over g of y,which is itself a function of y,times dy is equal toh of x dx.You would go from this first equationto the second equation just by dividingboth sides by g of yand multiplying both sides by dx.And then it's clear you have a separable equationyou can integrate both sides.But the key is let's solve for the derivativeand see if we can put this in a formwhere we have the product of a function of ytimes a function of x.So let's do it with this first one here.So let's see, if I subtract y from both sides,I'm just trying to solve for thederivative of y with respect to x.I'm gonna get x times,I'll write y primeis the derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to 3 minus y.So I subtracted y from both sides.Let's see if I divide both sides by x,I'm gonna get the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal to,actually I'm gonna write it this way.I'm gonna write it 3 minus y times 1 over x.And so it's clear I'm able to writethe derivative as a product ofa function of y, and a function of x.So this indeed is separable.And I could show you,I could multiply both sides by dxand I could divide both sides by 3 minus y now,and I would get 1 over 3 minus y dyis equal to 1 over x dx.So clearly, this one right over here is separable.Now let's do the second one.And I'm gonna just do the same technique,I'll do it in a slightly different colourso we don't get all of our math all jumbled together.So in this second one,let's see, if I subtract the 2x,the 2y from both sides,so actually, lemme just do, whoops,lemme do a couple things at once.I'm gonna subtract 2x from both sides.I am going to subtract 2y from both sides.So I'm gonna subtract 2y from both sides.I'm gonna add one to both sides,so I'm gonna add oneto both sides.And then what am I going to get if I do that?This is gonna be zero,this is gonna be zero,this is gonna be zero.I'm gonna have 2 times the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal tonegative 2x minus2y plus 1.And now see I can divide everything by two;I would get the derivative of ywith respect to x is equal to,and actually, yeah I would get,I'm just gonna divide by two,so I'm gonna get negative x minus yand then I'm going to getplus 1/2.So it's not obvious to mehow I can write this as a productof a function of x and a function of y.So this one does not feel,this one right over here is not separable.I don't know how to write thisas a function of x times a function of y,so this one I'm not gonna,I'm gonna say is not separable.Now this one, they've already written it for usas a function of x times a function of y.So this one is clearly separable right over hereand if you want me to do the separatingI can rewrite this as,well this is dy dx.If I multiply both sides by dxand divide both sides by this right over here,I would get one over y squared plus y dyis equal to x squared plus x dx.So clearly separable.Alright now this last choice,this is interesting,they've essentially distributed the derivativeright over here.So let's see, if we were to unfactorthe derivative, I'm just gonna solve for dy dx.So I'm gonna factor it out.I'm gonna get dy dxtimes x plus y,x plus y,is equal to x.Now if I were to divide both sidesby x plus y, I'm gonna get dy dxis equal to x over x plus y.And here my algebraic tool kitof how do I separate x and yso I can write this as a function of xtimes a function of y,not obvious to me here.So this one is not separable.So only the first one and the third one.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-particular-solutions-to-differential-equations/v/finding-constant-of-integration-exponential	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We're told that F of sevenis equal to 40 plus five, E to the seventh power,and F prime of X is equal to five,E to the X.What is F of zero?So to evaluate F of zero,let's take the anti-derivative of F prime of X,and then we're going to have a constantof integration there,so we can use the information that they gave us up herethat F of seven is equal to this.This might look like an expression.Well, it is an expression,but it's really just a number.There's no variables in this,and so we can use that to solvefor our constant of integration,and then we will have fully knownwhat F of X is,and we can use that to evaluate F of zero,so let's just do it.So if F prime of X is equal to five, E to the X,then F of X is going to be equalto the anti-derivative of F prime of X,or the anti-derivative of five, E to the X, DX,and this is the thing that I always find amazingabout exponentials,and actually, let me just take a step.I'll take that five out of the integralso it becomes a little bit more obvious.And so the anti-derivative of E to the X,well, that's just E to the Xbecause the derivative of E to the Xis E to the X,which I find amazing every timeI have to manipulate or take the derivativeor anti-derivative of E to the X.So this is gonna be five, E to the X, plus C,and you can verify.Take the derivative of five, E to the X, plus C.The derivative of five, E to the X,well, that's five, E to the X,so that works out.Well, and the derivative of C is zero,so you wouldn't see it over here.So now, let's use this informationto figure out what C isso that we know exactly what F of X is,and then we can evaluate F of zero.So we know that F of seven,so when X is equal to seven,this expression is going to evaluate to this thing,40 plus five, E to the seven.So, five times E to the seventh powerplus C is equal to 40, plus five,E to the seventh power.And notice, all I did is say, okay,F of seven.Well, if this is F of X--Let me write this down.So, if this is F of seven,if this is F of X,I just replaced the X with a sevento find F of seven,and we know that F of seven is also goingto be equal to that.They gave us that information,but when you just look at this,it's pretty easy to figure out what C is going to be.You can subtract five, E to the sevenfrom both sides,and you see that C is equal to 40.And so we can rewrite F of X.We can say that F of X is equalto five, E to the X,plus C, which is 40.And so now, from that,we can evaluate F of zero.F of zero is going to be five timesE to the zero power, plus 40.E to the zero is one,so it's gonna be five times one,which is just five, plus 40,which is equal to 45,and we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-particular-solutions-to-differential-equations/v/particular-solution-to-differential-equation-example	khanacademy	video	:00- Let's now get some practice with separable differentialequations, so let's say I have the differential equation,the derivative of Y with respect to X is equal totwo Y-squared, and let's say that the graph of a particularsolution to this, the graph of a particular solution,passes through the point one comma negative one, so myquestion to you is, what is Y, what is Y when X is equal tothree for this particular solution, so the particularsolution to the differential equation that passes throughthe point one comma negative one, what is Y when X isequal to three, and I encourage you to pause the video,and try to work through it on your own.So I'm assuming you had a go at it, and the key with aseparable differential equation, and that's a big cluethat I'm even calling it a separable differential equation,is that you separate the Xs from the Ys.Or all the Xs and the DXs from the Ys and DYs.So how do you do that here?Well, what I could do, let me just rewrite it.So it's gonna be DY DX is equal to two Y-squared,is equal to two Y, equal to two Y-squared.So let's see, we can multiply both sides by DX,and let's see, so then we're gonna have, that cancels withthat if we treat it as just a value, or as a variable.We're gonna have DY is equal to two Y squared DX.Well, we're not quite done yet.We gotta get this two Y squared on the left hand side.So we can divide both sides by two Y-squared.So if we divide both sides by two Y-squared, two Y-squared,the left hand side, we could rewrite this as 1/2 Y to thenegative two power, is going to be equal to DY, DY isequal to DX, and now, we can integrate both sides.So we can integrate both sides.Let me give myself a little bit more space.And so, what is, what is this left hand side going to be?Well, we increment the exponent,and then divide by that value, so Y to the negative two,if your increment is Y to the negative one,and then divide by negative one,so this is going to be -1/2 Y to the negative one power,and we could do a plus C like we did in the previous video,but we're gonna have a plus C on both sides,and you could subtract, or you know, you havedifferent arbitrary constants on both sides andyou could subtract them from each other,so I'm just gonna write the constant only on one side.So you have that is equal to, well if I integrate just DX,that's just going to give me X, that's just gonna give me X.So this right over here is X,and of course I can have a plus C over there,and If I want I can, I can solve for Y if I multiply,let's see, I can multiply both sides by negative two,and then I'm gonna have, the left hand side you're justgonna have Y to the negative one, or 1/Y is equal to,if I multiply the right hand side times negative two,I'm gonna have negative two times X plus, wellit's some arbitrary constant, it's still going to,it's gonna be negative two times this arbitrary constantbut I could still just call it some arbitrary constant, andthen if we want we can take the reciprocal of both sides,and so we will get Y is equal to, is equal to 1/-2X+C.And now we can use, we can use the information they gave usright over here, the fact that our particular solutionneeds to go through this point to solve for C.So, when X is negative one, so when X is negative one.Oh sorry, when X is one, when X is one, Y is negative one,so we get negative one is equal to 1/-2+C, orwe could say C minus two, we could multiply both sides timesC minus two, if then we will get, actually let me justscroll down a little bit, so if you multiply both sidestimes C minus two, negative one times C minus two is goingto be negative C plus two or two minus C is equal to one.All I did is I multiplied C minus two times both sides,and then, let's see, I can subtract two from both sides, sonegative C is equal to negative one, and then if I multiplyboth sides by negative one, we get C is equal to one.So our particular solution is Y is equal to 1/-2X+1.And we are almost done, they didn't just ask for,we didn't just ask for the particular solution,we asked, what is Y when X is equal to three.So Y is going to be equal to one over, three timesnegative two is negative six plus one, which is equal tonegative, is going to be equal to 1/-5, or -1/5.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-particular-solutions-to-differential-equations/v/using-particular-solution-to-separable-differential-equation	khanacademy	video	:00- [Teacher] We're given a differential equationright over here, cosine of y plus two,this whole thing times the derivativeof y with respect to x is equal to two x,and we're given that for a particular solution,when x is equal to one, y of one is equal to zero,and we're asked what is x when y is equal to pi?So the first thing I like to look atwhen I see a differential equation is: is it separable?Can I get all the ys and dys on one side,and can I get all the xs and dxs on the other side?And this one seems like it is.If I multiply both sides by dx,where you can view dx as the x differentialof an infinitely small change in x,well, then you get cosine of yplus two times dy is equal to two x times dx,so just like that I would've been able to, all I did isI multiplied both sides of this times dx,and I was able to separate the ys and the dysfrom the xs and the dxs, and now I can integrate both sides.So, if I integrate both sides, what am I going to get?So the antiderivative of cosine of y with respect to y,with respect to y, is sine of y,and then the antiderivative of 2 with respect to y is 2y,and that is going to be equal to,well, the antiderivative of 2x with respect to x isx squared, and we can't forget that we could say a plusa different constant on either side,but it serves our purpose just to say plus c on one side,and so this is a general solutionto the separable differential equation,and then we can find the particular one by substituting inwhen x is equal to one, y is equal to zero,so let's do that to solve for c.So we get, or when y is equal to zero, x is equal to one,so, sine of zero plus two times zero,all I did is I substituted in the zero for y,is equal to x squared, well now x is one,is equal to one squared plus c.Well sine of zero is zero, two times zero is zero,all of that's just gonna be zero,so we get zero is equal to one plus c,or c is equal to negative one.So now we can write down the particular solutionto this differential equation that meets these conditions.So we get, let me write it over here,sine of y plus two y is equal tox squared, and our constant is negative one, so minus one.And now what is x when y is equal to pi?So, sine of pi plus two times pi is equal tox squared minus one, see sine of pi is equal to zero,and so we get, let's see we can add one to both sides,and we get two pi plus one is equal to x squared,or we could say that x is equal to the plus or minusthe square root of two pi plus one.So I would write the plus or minus square rootof two pi plus one, and we're done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-exponential-models/v/modeling-population-with-simple-differential-equation	khanacademy	video	:00- What I'd like to do in this video is start exploringhow we can model things with the differential equations.And in this video in particular,we will explore modeling population.Modeling population.We're actually going to go into some depth onthis eventually, but here we're goingto start with simpler models.And we'll see, we will stumble on usingthe logic of differential equations.Things that you might have seenin your algebra or your precalculus class.So, in some level, what we're going to do hereis going to be review, but we're going to get thereusing the power of modeling with differential equations.So let's just define some variables.Let's say that P is equal to our population.And let's say that t is, let's say that t isequal to the time that has passed in days.In days, it could have been years or months.But let's say we're doing the population ofinsects that reproduce quite quickly.So days seem like a nice time span to care about.Now, what would be a reasonable model?Well, we could say that the rate of change,the rate of change of our population, with respect to time,with respect to time is, well, a reasonable thing to sayis that it's going to be proportionalto the actual population, the actual population.Why is that reasonable?Well, the larger the population,the larger the rate at any given time.If you have a thousand people, the rateat which they're reproducing is going to be more,or a thousand insects is going to be more insectsper second, per day or per yearthan if you only have 10 insects.So it makes sense that the rate of growthof your population, with respect to time,is going to be proportional to your population.And so, you know, sometimes you think ofdifferential equations as these daunting complex things,but notice we've just been able to expressa reasonably not so complicated idea.The rate of change of population is goingto be proportional to the population.And now, once we've expressed that, we can actuallytry to solve this differential equation.Find a general solution, and then we can try to put someinitial conditions on there or some states of the populationthat we know to actually solve for the constantsto find a particular solution.So how do we do that?And I encourage you to pause the video at any timeand see if you can solve this differential equation.So assuming you, at least, maybe have had an attempt at it,and you might immediately recognize thatthis is a separable differential equation.And in separable differential equations,we want one variable and all the differentialsinvolving that variable on one side, and the other variableand all the differentials involvingthe other variable on the other side,and then we can integrate both sides.And once again, dP, the derivative of P with respect to t,this isn't quite a fraction.This is the limit as our change in P over change in time.This is our instantaneous change, but for the sake ofseparable differential equationsor differential equations in general, you can treat,you can treat these, this derivative in Leibniz notationslike fractions, and you can treat these differentialslike quantities because we will eventually integrate them.So let's do that.So, we want to put all the Ps and dPs on one sideand all the, all the things that involve tor that I guess don't involve P on the other side.So, we could divide both sides by P.We could divide both sides by P, and so we'll haveone over P, and you have one over Phere and then those will cancel,and then you can multiply both sides times dt.We could multiply both sides times dt.Once again, treating the differential like a quantitywhich isn't, it really isn't a quantity.You really have to view this as a limit ofchange in P over change in time.The limit as we get smaller and smallerand smaller changes in time.But for, once again, for the sake of thiswe can do this, and when we do thatwe would be left with one over P dPis equal to, is equal tok dt, is equal to k dt.Now we can integrate, integrate both sides.Because this was a separable differential equation,we were able to completely separate the Ps and dPs fromthe things involving ts or, I guess,the things that aren't involving Ps, and thenif we integrate this side, we would get the natural log,the natural log of the absolute value of our population,and we could say plus some constant if we wantbut we're going to get a constant on this side as wellso we could just say that's going to be equal to,that's going to be equal to k, it's going to be equal tok times t, k times t plus some constant.Plus some constant.I'll just call that C one, and once againI could've put a plus C two here, but I could'vethen subtracted the constant from both sidesand I would just get the constant on the right hand side.Now, how can I solve for P?Well, the natural log of the absolute value of Pis equal to this thing right over here.That means that's the same thing.That means that the absolute value of P,that means that the absolute value of Pis equal to e to all this business,e to the, e to the, let me do in the same colors,kt, kt plus,plus C one, plus C one.Now this right over here is the same thing.Just using our exponent properties, this is the same thingas e to the kt,e to the k times ttimes e, times e to the C one,e to the C one.Now this is just e to some constant,so we could just call this,let's just call that the constant C.So this is all simplified to C e,C e to the kt,to the kt.And if we assume our population at any given timeis positive then we could get rid ofthis absolute value sign, and we have a general solutionto this, frankly, fairly general differential equation.We just said proportional.We haven't given what the proportionality constant is,but we could say, if we assume, positive populationthat the population is going to be equal tosome constant C times e to the kt power.To the kt power, and the reason why I said thatyou've seen this before is thisis just an exponential function, and it's very likely thatin algebra or in precalculus classyou have modeled things with exponential functions,and my guess is that you've modeled things,modeled things like population.The reason why this is interesting isyou now see where this is coming from.The underlying logic that's just drivenby the actual differential equation.The rate of change, with respect to time, of the population.Well, maybe it's just proportional to population.So I'll leave you there, and in the next videowe'll do what you probably did in the 10th or 11th gradeor maybe later in your life, it doesn't matter whenyou did it, where we actually look at someinitial conditions to find a particular solution.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-exponential-models/v/particular-solution-given-initial-conditions-for-population	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] In the last video, we established thatif we say the rate of change of a populationwith respect to time is going to be proportionalto the population, we were able tosolve that differential equation, find a general solution,which involves an exponential.That the population is going to be equal to some constanttimes e to some other constant, times time.And in the last video we assumed time was days.So let's just apply this, just to feel goodthat we can truly model population this way.So let's use it with some concrete numbers.Once again, you've probably done that before.You've probably started with the assumptionthat you can model with an exponential function,and then you used some information, some conditions,to figure out what the constants are.You probably did this earlierin pre-calculus or algebra class.Let's just do it again, just so that we can feelthat this thing right over here is useful.So let's give you some information.Let's say, that at time equals zero,the population is equal to 100 insectsor whatever we're measuring the population of.And let's say that at time equals 50, the population,so after 50 days, the population is at 200.So notice it doubled after 50 days.So given this information, can we solve for C and k?I encourage you to pause the videoand try to work through it on your own.So this first initial condition's pretty straighforwardto you, because when t is equal to zero, P is 100.So we could say, based on this first piece of information,we could say that 100 must be equal toC times e to the k times zero.Well that's just going to be e to the zero.Well e to the zero is just one.So this is just the same thing as C times one,and just like that we have figured out what C is.We can now write that the populationis going to be equal to 100e to the kt.So you can see, expressed this way,our C is always going to be our initial population.So, e to the kt.And now, we can use this second piece of information.So our population is 200, let's write that down.So our population is 200, when time is equal to 50.After 50 days.So 200 is equal to 100e to the k times 50, right?t is now 50.Let me just write that.k times 50.Now we can divide both sides by 100,and we will get, two is equal to e to the 50k.Then we can take the natural log of both sides.Natural log on the left hand side,we get the natural log of two.And on the right hand side, the natural log of e to the 50k,well that's just going to be, that's the powerthat you need to raise e to, to get e to the 50k.Well that's just going to be 50k.All you did was took the natural log of both sides.Notice, that this equation that I've just writtenexpresses the same thing.Natural log of two is equal to 50k,that means e to the 50k is equal to two,which is exactly what we had written there.And now we can solve for k.Divide both sides by 50, and we are left with,k is equal to the natural log of 2, over 50.And we're done.We can now write the particular solutionthat meets these conditions.So we can now write that our population,and I can even write our population as a function of time,is going to be equal to 100 times e to the,now k is natural log of two over 50, so I'll write that.So, natural log of two over 50, and then that times t.If you assume rate of change of populationis going to be proportional to population,you assume this information right over here,this function is what is going to describeyour growth of population.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-differential-equations/cs1-exponential-models/v/exponential-solution-to-differential-equation	khanacademy	video	":00- [Teacher] So, we've got the differential equation,the derivative of y with respect to x is equalto three times y.And we want to find the particular solutionthat gives us y being equal to twowhen x is equal to one.So, I encourage you to pause this videoand see if you can figure this out on your own.All right, now, let's work through it together.So, some of you might have immediately said,""Hey, this is the form of a differential equation""where the solution is going to be an exponential,""and you just got right to it.But, I'm not going to go straight to that,I'm just gonna recognize that this is a separabledifferential equation and that I'm gonna solve it that way.So, when I say that it's separable,that means that we can separate the y's, dy's,on one side, and all the x's, dx's on the other side.And so, what I can do is if I divide both sidesof this equation by y and multiply both sides by dx,I get one over y, dy,is equal to three-dx.Now, on the left and right hand sides,I have these clean things that I can now integrate.That's what people talk aboutwhen they say separable differential equation.Now, here on the left, if I wanted to write itin a fairly general form, I could write,well, the anti-derivative of one over yis gonna be the natural log of the absolute value of y.I'm taking the anti-derivative with respect to y, here.Now, I could add a constant,but I'm gonna add in a constant on the right-hand side,so there's no reason to add two arbitrary constantson both sides.I could just add one on one side.So, that is going to be equal tothe anti-derivative here is going to bethree-x and I'll add the promised constant, plus c,right over there.And now, let's think about it a little bit.Well, we can rewrite this in exponential form.We could say, we could write,that e to the three-x plus c is equalto the natural log of y.I could write the natural of y is equalto e to three-x plus c.Now, I could rewrite this is equal to e to three-xtimes e to the c.Now, e to the c is just gonna be someother arbitrary constant, which I could still denote by c.They're are going to be different values,but we're just trying to just get a senseof what the structure of this thing looks like.So, we could say this is going to be some constanttimes e to the three-x.So, another way of thinking about it.Saying the absolute value of y is equal to this.This isn't a function yet.We're trying to find this function solutionto this differential equation.So, this would tell us either y is equal to c,e to the three-x,or y is equal to negative c, e to the three-x.Well, we've kept it in general terms.I haven't put any...We don't know c is.So, what we could do, instead, is just pick this one,and then we can solve for cassuming this one right over here.And so, we will see if we can meet these constraintsusing this and it'll essentially take the other oneinto consideration, whether we're going positiveor negative.So, let's do that.So, when y is equal to two,I'm now going to solve for cto find the particular solution, x is equal to one,or when x is equal to one, y is equal to two.So, I could write it like that,and we get two is equalto c times eto the third power, three times one.And so, to solve for c, I could just divideboth sides by e to the third,and so I could, or I could multiply both sidestimes e to the negative third,and I could get two e to the negative third poweris equal to c.And so let's now substitute it back inand our particular solutions is gonna bey is equal to c.C is two-e to the negative third powertimes e to the three-x.Now, I'm taking the product of two thingswith the same base.I can add the exponents.So, I could say y is equal totwo times e to the three-xand I'll add the exponentsto three-x minus three, and there you go.This is one way that you could write the particular solutionthat meets these constraintsfor this separable differential equation."

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-average-value-of-a-function/v/calculating-function-average-over-interval	khanacademy	video	:00- Let's say that we have the functionF of X is equal to X squaredplus one and what we want to dois we want to figure out the average valueof our function F on the interval,on the closed interval between zeroand let's say between zero and three.I encourage you to pause this videoespecially if you've seen the other videoson introducing the idea of an averagevalue of a function and figure outwhat this is.What is the average value of our function Fover this interval?So, I'm assuming you've had a go at it.Let's just visualize what's going onand then we can actually find the average.So that's my Y axis.This is my X axis.Now over the interval betweenzero and three, so let's saythis is the zero, this is one, two, three.It's a closed interval.When X is zero F of zerois going to be one.So, we're going to be right over here.F of one is two.So it's one, two, three.Actually, let me make my scalea little bit smaller on that.I have to go all the way up to 10.So this is going to be 10.This is going to be five.And then one, two, three.This is the hardest part is makingthis even.So see this is going to be in the middle.Pretty good, and then let's see in the middle.Then we have that.Good enough. All right.So, we're going to be there.We're going to be there.I have obviously different scalesfor X and Y axis.Two squared plus one is five.Three squared plus one is 10.Three squared plus one is 10.So it's going to look something like this.This is what our function is goingto look like.So, that's the graph of Y isequal to F of X.And we care about the average valueon the closed interval between zero and three.Between zero and three.So, one way to think about it,you could apply the formula,but it's very important to think aboutwhat does that formula actually mean?Once again, you shouldn't memorizethis formula because it actually kindof falls out out of what it actually means.So the average of our functionis going to be equal to the definiteintegral over this interval.So, essentially the area under this curve.So, it's going to be the definite intergralfrom zero to three of F of X which isX squared plus one DX.Then we're going to take this area.We're going to take this arearight over here and we're goingto divide it by the width of our intervalto essentially come up with the average height,or the average value of our function.So, we're going to divide it by B minus A,or three minus zero, which is justgoing to be three.And so now we just have to evaluate this.So, this is going to be equal toone third times --Let's see the antiderivative of X squaredis X to the third over three.Antiderivative of one is X,and we're going to evaluate it from zero to three.So, this is going to be equal to one thirdtimes when we evaluate it at three.Let me use another color here.When we evaluate it at three it'sgoing to be three to the thirddivided by three.Well, that's just going to be 27 dividedby three.That's nine plus three and thenwhen we evaluated zero, minus zerominus zero.So, it's just minus.When you evaluated zero it'sjust going to be zero.And so, we are left with --I'm going to make the bracketsthat same color.This is going to be one thirdtimes 12.One third times 12, which is equalto four.Which is equal to four.So this is the average valueof our function.The average value of our functionover this interval is equal to four.Notice, our function actually hitsthat value at some point in the interval.At some point in the interval,something lower than two but greater than one.We can maybe call that C.It looks like our function hits that value.This is actually a generally true thing.This is a mean value theoremfor integrals and we'll go into more depth there.But you can see this kind of does looklike it's average value.That if you imagine the box, if youmultiplied this height, this average valuetimes this width you would have thisarea right over here, and thisarea right over here is the same,this area that I'm highlightingin yellow right over here is the sameas the area under the curvebecause we have the average heighttimes the width is the samething as the area under the curve.So, anyway hopefully you foundthat interesting.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-average-value-of-a-function/v/mean-value-theorem-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] We have many videos on the mean value theorem,but I'm going to review it a little bit, so that we cansee how this connects the mean value theoremthat we learned in differential calculus,how that connects to what we learned aboutthe average value of a function using definite integrals.So the mean value theorem tells us that if I havesome function f that is continuous on the closed interval,so it's including the endpoints, from a to b,and it is differentiable, so the derivativeis defined on the open interval, from a to b,so it doesn't necessarily have to be differentiableat the boundaries, as long as it's differentiablebetween the boundaries, then we know thatthere exists some value, or some number c,such that c is between the two endpoints of our interval,so such that a < c < b, so c is in this interval, AND,and this is kind of the meat of it,is that the derivative of our function at that point,you could use as the slope of the tangent lineat that point, is equal to essentially the averagerate of change over the interval, or you could eventhink about it as the slope between the two endpoints.So the slope between the two endpoints is gonna beyour change in y, which is going to beyour change in your function value,so f of b, minus f of a, over b minus a, and once again,we go into much more depth in thiswhen we covered it the first time in differential calculus,but just to give you a visualization of it,'cause I think it's always handy, themean value theorem that we learned in differential calculusjust tells us, hey look, if this is a, this is b,I've got my function doing something interesting,so this is f of a, this is f of b, so this quantityright over here, where you're taking the changein the value of our function, so this right over here isf of b, minus f of a, is this change in thevalue of our function, divided by the changein our x-axis, so it's a change in y over change in x,that gives us the slope, this right over here gives usthe slope of this line, the slope of the linethat connects these two points, that's this quantity,and the mean value theorem tell us that there's some cin between a and b where you're gonna have the same slope,so it might be at LEAST one place, so it might beright over there, where you have the exact same slope,there exists a c where the slope of the tangent lineat that point is going to be the same, so this would bea c right over there, and we actually might havea couple of c's, that's another candidate c.There's at least one c where the slopeof the tangent line is the same as the average slopeacross the interval, and once again, we have to assumethat f is continuous, and f is differentiable.Now when you see this, it might evoke some similaritieswith what we saw when we saw how we defined,I guess you could say, or the formulafor the average value of a function.Remember, what we saw for the average value of a function,we said the average value of a function is going to beequal to 1 over b minus a, notice, 1 over b minus a,you have a b minus a in the denominator here,times the definite integral from a to b, of f of x dx.Now this is interesting, 'cause here we have a derivative,here we have an integral, but maybe we could connect these.Maybe we could connect these two things.Well one thing that might jump out at youis maybe we could rewritethis numerator right over here in this form somehow.And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can,and I'll give you actually quite a huge hint,instead of it being an f of x here, what happens if there'san f prime of x there, so I encourage you to try to do that.So once again, let me rewrite all of this,this is going to be equal to...This over here is the exact same thing asthe definite integral from a to b, of f prime of x dx.Think about it.You're gonna take the anti-derivative of f prime of x,which is going to be f of x, and you're going toevaluate it at b, f of b, and then from thatyou're going to subtract it evaluated at a, minus f of a.These two things are identical.And then, you can of course divide by b minus a.Now this is starting to get interesting.One way to think about it is, there must be a cthat takes on the average value of,there must be a c, that when youevaluate the derivative at c,it takes on the average value of the derivative.Or another way to think about it,if we were to just write g of x is equal to f prime of x,then we get very close to what we have over here,because this right over here is going to be g of c,remember, f prime of c is the same thing as g of c,is equal to 1 over b minus a, so there exists a cwhere g of c is equal to 1 over b minus a,times the definite integral from a to b, of g of x dx,f prime of x is the same thing as g of x.So another way of thinking about it, this is actuallyanother form of the mean value theorem,it's called the mean value theorem for integrals.I'll just write the acronym,mean value theorem for integrals, or integration,which essentially, to give it in a slightly moreformal sense, is if you have some function g, so if g is,let me actually go down a little bit, which tells us thatif g of x is continuous on this closed interval,going from a to b, then there exists a c in this intervalwhere g of c is equal to, what is this?This is the average value of our function.There exists a c where g of c is equal tothe average value of your function over the interval.This was our definition of the average value of a function.So anyway, this is just another way of saying you mightsee some of the mean value theorem of integrals,and just to show you that it's really closely tied,it's using different notation, but it's usually,it's essentially the same exact idea as themean value theorem you learned in differential calculus,but now your different notation, and I guessyou could have a slightly different interpretation.We were thinking about it in differential calculus,we're thinking about having a point wherethe slope of the tangent line of the function of that pointis the same as the average rate, so that's whenwe had our kind of differential mode, and we were kind ofthinking in terms of slopes, and slopes of tangent lines,and now, when we're in integral mode, we're thinkingmuch more in terms of average value,average value of the function, so there's some c,where g of c, there's some c,where the function evaluated at that point,is equal to the average value, so another wayof thinking about it, if I were to draw g of x,that's x, that is my y-axis, this is the graph ofy is equal to g of x, which of course is the same thingas f prime of x, but we've just rewritten it nowto be more consistent with our average value formula,and we're talking about the interval from a to b,we've already seen how to calculate the average value,so maybe the average value is that right over there,so that is g average, so our average value is this,the mean value theorem for integrals just tells usthere's some c where our function must take onthat value at c, whereas that c is inside,where the c is in that interval.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-straight-line-motion-3/v/motion-problems-with-integrals	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois start thinking about the positionof an object traveling in one dimension.And to get our bearings there,I'm going to introduce a few ideas.So the first idea is that of displacement.So you might use that word in everyday language,and it literally means your change in position,your change in position.Now a related idea that sometimes get confusedwith displacement is a notion ofdistance traveled.You might say well doesn't that,isn't that just the same thing as change in position?And you will see shortly, no, it isn'talways the same thing.The distance traveled, this is the total length of path,total lengthof path.So what are we talking about?Well let's say, and we're going to introducea little bit of calculus now,let's say that we have a particle's velocity function.And so let's say our velocity as a function of timeis equal to five minus t.Now this is a one-dimensional velocity function.Let's say it's just telling us our velocityin the horizontal direction.And oftentimes when something's one dimension,people forget well that too can be a vector quantity.In fact this velocity is a vector quantitybecause you could think of it if it's positiveit's moving to the right,and if it's negative it's moving to the left.So it has a direction.And so sometimes you will see a vector quantity like thishave a little arrow on it,or you will see it bolded,or you will see it bolded like that.I like to write an arrow in,although that's not always the convention usedin different classes.Now let's plot what this velocity functionactually looks like,and I did that ahead of time.So you can see here,at time equals zero, let's say time is in seconds,and our velocity's in meters per second.So this is meters per second right over here,and this is seconds on this axis.At exactly time zero,this object is traveling at five meters per second.We can say to the right, it has a velocityof positive five meters per second.But then it keeps decelerating at a constant rate,so five seconds into it,right at five seconds,the particle has no velocity,and then it starts having negative velocity,which you could interpret asmoving to the left.So let's think about a few things.First let's think about what is the displacementover the first five seconds,over firstfive seconds?Well we've seen already multiple times,if you wanna find the change in quantity,you can take the integral of the rate function of it.And so velocity is actually the rate of displacementis one way to think about it.So displacement over the first five seconds,we can take the integralfrom zero to five,zero to five,of our velocity function,of our velocity function.Just like that.And we can even calculate this really fast.That would just be this area right over here,which we can just use a little bit of geometry.This is a five by five triangle,so five times five is 25, times 1/2,remember area of a triangle's 1/2 base times height.So this is going to be 12.5,and let's see this is going to be meters per secondtimes seconds, so 12.5 meters.So that's the change in positionfor that particle over the first five seconds.Wherever it started,it's now going to be 12.5 meters to the right of it,assuming that positive is to the right.Now what about over,over the first10 seconds?Now this gets interesting,and I encourage you to pause your video and think about it.What would be the displacement over the first 10 seconds?Well we would just do the same thing,the integral from zero to 10of our velocity function,our one-dimensional velocity function, dt.And so that would be the area from hereall the way to right over there.So this entire area.But you might appreciate,when you're taking a definite integral,if we are below the t-axisand above the function like this,this is gonna be negative area.And in fact this area and this areaare going to exactly cancel out,and you're going to get zero meters.Now you might be saying how can that be?After 10 seconds how do we,what why is our displacement only zero meters?This particle's been moving the entire time.Well remember what's going on.The first five seconds, it's moving to the right,it's decelerating the whole time,and then right at five seconds,it has gone 12.5 meters to the right.But then it starts, it's velocity starts becoming negative,and the particle starts moving to the left.And so over the next five seconds,it actually moves 12.5 meters to the left,and then these two things net out.So the particle has gone over 10 seconds 12.5 metersto the right and then 12.5 meters to the left,and so its change in position is zero meters.It has not changed.Now you might start,you might start to be appreciatingwhat the difference between displacementand distance traveled is.So distance,if you're talking about your total length of path,you don't care as much about direction.And so instead of thinking about velocity,what we would do is think about speed.And speed is,you could viewin this case, especially in this one-dimensional case,this is equal to the absolute value of velocity.Later on when we do multiple dimensions,it would be the magnitude of the velocity function,which is what the absolute function,which is what the absolute value function does,in one dimension.So what would this look like if we plotted it?Well the absolute value of the velocity functionwould just look like that.And so if you want the distance,you would find, the distance traveled I should say,you would find the integral over the appropriatechange in time of the speed function right over here,which we have graphed.So notice, if we want the distance traveled,so I'll just say I'll write it out,distance traveledover first five seconds,first five seconds,what would it be?Well it would be the integral from zero to fiveof the absolute value of our velocity function,which is you can just view it as our speed functionright over here, dt.And so it would be this area,which we already know to be 12.5 meters.So for the first five seconds,your distance and displacement are consistent.Well that's because you have in this casethe velocity function is positive,so the absolute value of it is still going to be positive.But if you think about overthe first 10 seconds, your distance,10 seconds,what is it going to be?Pause the video and try to think about it.Well that's gonna be the integral from zero to 10of the absolute value of our velocity function,which is going to be equal to what?It's going to be this area plus this arearight over here.So plus this area right over here.And so this is going to five times five times 1/2plus five times five times 1/2,which is going to be 25 meters.The particle has gone 12.5 meters to the right,and then it goes back 12.5 meters to the left.Your displacement, your net change in position is a zero,but the total length of path traveledis 25 meters.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-straight-line-motion-3/v/analyzing-motion-problems-position	khanacademy	video	:01- [Instructor] Divya received the following problem.A particle moves in a straight line with velocityv of t is equal to the square rootof three t minus one meters per second,where t is time in seconds.At t equals two,the particle's distance from the starting pointwas eight meters in the positive direction.What is the particle's position at t equals seven seconds?Which expression should Divya use to solve the problem?So pause this video and have a go at it.Alright now let's do this together.So we wanna know the particle's positionat t is equal to seven.So what we could do,they tell us what our position is at t equals two,so what the position att equals seven would be your positionat t equals two plusyour changein positionfrom t equals twoto t is equal to seven.And there's another word for this.You could also call this your displacementfrom t equals two to t equals seven.And we know how to think about displacement.Velocity is your rate of change of displacement.And so if you wanna figure out your displacement,your between two times,you would integrate the velocity function.So this is going to be the integralfrom t equals two to t equals sevenof our velocity function, v of t, dt.This would be our displacement from time two to time seven.So if they said what is our change in positionfrom time two to time seven,it would be just this expression.But they want us,they want us to figure out,or they want Divya to figure out,what is the particle's position at t equals seven seconds.So what you'd wanna do is your positionat t equals two,and we know what our position at t equals two is.It was eight meters in the positive direction,so we could just call that positive eight meters.So it's going to be eight plusyour change in position,which is going to be your displacement.And let's see we can see this choiceright over there,and that's what we would pick.This first option,v of seven, that just gives us ourvelocity at time seven,or at the exactly at seven seconds.Or another way, our rate of change of displacementat seven seconds.So that's not what we want.This one right over here,you have your positionat t equals two,but then you have your change in positionfrom t equals zero to t equals seven.So this doesn't seem, this isn't right.And this is your position at time twoplus your v prime,the derivative of velocity is the acceleration,plus your acceleration at time seven,so that's definitely not gonna give youyour the particle's position.So we like that second choice.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-straight-line-motion-3/v/analyzing-motion-problems-total-dist-traveled	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] Alexey received the following problem:A particle moves in a straight linewith velocity v of t is equal to negative t squaredplus eight meters per second,where t is time in seconds.At t is equal to two, the particle's distancefrom the starting point was five meters.What is the total distance the particle has traveledbetween t equals two and t equals six seconds?Which expression should Alexey use to solve the problem?So we don't actually have to figure the actual answer out,we just have to figure outwhat is the appropriate expression.So like always, pause this videoand see if you can work through it on your own.So now let's tackle this together.So the key question is what is the total distancethe particle has traveled between t equals twoand t equals six?So we just care what happens between those points,we don't care that the particle's distancefrom the starting point was five meters at t equals two.So this right over here is actually unnecessary information.So the first thing that you might wanna think aboutis well maybe distance is just the integralof the velocity function;We've seen that multiple times.If you want to find the change in a quantity,you just say the starting time and the ending timeand then you integrate the rate function.So wouldn't it just be that?Now we have to be very very careful.If the question was what is the displacementfor the particle between time equals twoand time equals six,this would have been the correct answer.So this would be displacement.Displacement from t equals twoto t is equal to six.But they're not saying displacement.They're saying total distance the particle has traveled.So this is the total path length for the particle.So one way to think about it,you would integrate not the velocity function,if you integrate velocity, you get displacement,instead, you would integrate the speed function.Now what is speed?It is the magnitude of velocityand in one dimension, it would just bethe absolute value of your velocity function.And so the absolute value of the velocity function,this would give you, integrating the speed,this would give you the distance.Distance from t equals twoto t is equal to six,and let's see, we have that choice right over here.The displacement one here,this is an interesting distracterbut that is not going to be the choice.This one right over here, v prime of six,that gives you the acceleration.If you're taking the derivative of the velocity function,the acceleration at six seconds,that's not what we're interested in.And this gives you the absolute difference in velocity,when in between time six and time two,that's not what we're trying to figure out either.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-straight-line-motion-3/v/antiderivative-acceleration	khanacademy	video	:00Let's review a little bit of what we learned in differential calculus.Let's say we have some function S that it gives us asa function of time the position of a particle in one dimension.If we were to take the derivative with respect to time.So if we were to take the derivative with respect to timeof this function S.What are we going to get?Well we're going to get ds, dt or therate in which position changes with respect to time.And what's another word for that, position changes with respect to time?Well, that's just velocity.So that we can write as velocity as a function of time.Now, what if we were to take the derivative of that with respect to time.So we could either view this as the second derivative, we'retaking the derivative not once, but twice of our position function.Or you could say that we're taking thederivative with respect to time of our velocity function.Well this is going to be, we can write this as, we can writethis as dv, dt, the rate at which velocity is changing with respect to time.And what's another word for that?Well, that's also called acceleration.This is going to be our acceleration as a function of time.So, you start with the position function, takeit, the position as a function of time.Take its derivative with respected time, you get velocity.Take that derivative with respected time, you get acceleration.Well, you could go the other way around.If you started with acceleration, if you startedwith acceleration, and you were to take the antiderivative.If you were to take the antiderivative of it, the anti, anti, an antiderivativeof it is going to be, actually let me just write it this way.So an antiderivative, I'll just use the intervalsymbol to show that I'm taking the antiderivative.Is going to be the integral of the anti-derivative of a of t.And this is going to give you some expression with a plus c.And we could say, well, that's a general form of our velocity function.This is going to be equal to our velocity function.And to find the particular velocity function, we would haveto know what the velocity is at a particular time.And then, we could solve for our c.Whether then, if we're able to do that and we were to take the anti-derivative again.Then, now we're taking the anti-derivative of our velocity function,which would give us some expression as a function of t.And then, some other constant.And, if we could solve for that constant, then we know, then we knowwhat the position is going to be, the position is a function of time.Just like this, it would have some, plus c here if weknow our position at a given time we could solve for that c.So now that we've reviewed it a little bit, but we've rewritten it in.I guess you could say, thinking of it not just fromthe differential point of view from the derivative point of view.But thinking of it from the anti-derivative point of view.Lets see if we can solve an interesting problem.Lets say that we know that the acceleration of aparticle is a function of time is equal to one.So it's always accelerating at one unit per,and you know, I'm not giving you time.Let, let's just say that we're thinking in terms of meters and seconds.So this is one meter per second, one meter per second-squared, right over here.That's our acceleration as a function of time.And, let's say we don't know the velocity expressions, but we knowthe velocity at a particular time and we don't know the position expressions.But we know the position at a particular time.So, let's say we know that the velocity, at time three.Let's say three seconds is negative three meters per second.And actually I wanna write the units here, just to make it a little, a little bit.So this is meters per second squared,that's going to be our unit for acceleration.This is our unit for velocity.And let's say that we know, let's say that we know that the position attime two, at two seconds is equal to negative ten meters.So, if we're thinking in one dimension, of if this is movingalong the number line, this is ten to the left of the origin.So, given this information right over here, and everything that I wrote up here.Can we figure out the actual expressions for velocity as a function of time?So not just velocity at time three, but velocity generally as a function of time.And position as a function of time.And I encourage you to pause this video right now.And try to figure it out on your own.So let's just work through this.What is, we know that velocity, as afunction of time, is going to be the anti-derivative.The anti-derivitive of our acceleration is a function of time.Our acceleration is just one.So this is going to be the anti-derivitive of this right over hereis going to be t and then we can't forget our constant plus c.And now we can solve for c because we know v of 3 is negative 3.So lets just write that down.So v of 3 is going to be equal to 3, 3 plus c.I just replaced where I saw the, the t or every place whereI have the t I replaced it with this 3 right over here.Actually let me make it a little bit clearer.So v of 3, v of 3 is equal to 3 plus c, and theytell us that that's equal to negative 3.So that is equal to, that is equal to negative 3.So what's c going to be?So if we just look at this part ofthe equation or just this equation right over here.If you subtract 3 from both sides, you get, you get c is equal to negative 6.And so now we know the exact, we know theexact expression that defines velocity as a function of time.V of t, v of t is equal to t, t plusnegative 6 or, t minus 6.And we can verify that.The derivative of this with respect to time is just one.And when time is equal to 3, time minus 6 is indeed negative 3.So we've been able to figure out velocity a s a function of time.So now let's do a similar thing to figure out position as a function of time.We know that position is gonna be an anti-derivativeof the velocity function, so let's write that down.So, position, as a function of time, is going tobe equal to the anti-derivative of v of t, dt.Which is equal to the anti-derivative of t minus 6, dt which isequal to well the anti-derivative of t, is t squared over 2.So, t squared over 2, we've seen that before.The anti-derivative of negative 6 is negative 6 t, and ofcourse, we can't forget our constant, so, plus, plus, c.So this is what s of t is equal to, sof t is equal to all of this business right over here.And now we can try to solve, for our constant.And we do that, using this information right over here.At two seconds were at, our position is negative two meters.So s of 2, or I could just write it this way.Well, let me write it this way.S of 2, at 2 seconds, is going to be equal to 2 squared over 2.That is, let's see, that's 4 over 2, that's going to be 2.Minus 6 times 2.So, minus 12 + c is equal to negative 10, is equal to negative 10.So, let's see, we get 2 minus 12 isnegative, is negative 10 plus c equals negative 10.So you add 10 to both sides you get c in this case is equal to 0.So we figured out what our position function is as well.The c right over here is just going to be 0.So our position as a function of time is equal to t squared over 2 minus 6 t.And you can verify.When t is equal to 2, t squared over 2 is 2, minus 12 is negative 10.You take the derivative here, you get t minus 6.And you can see and we already verified that v of 3 is negative 3.And you take the derivative here, you get a of t, just like that.Anyway, hopefully, you found this enjoyable.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-straight-line-motion-3/v/average-acceleration-over-interval	khanacademy	video	:00- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have a particlethat's traveling in one dimension, and its positionas a function of time is given as tto the third power plus two over t-squared.What I would like you to do is pause this videoand figure out what the average acceleration isof this particle over the interval, the closed interval,from t is equal to one to t is equal to two.What is this?What is this going to be equal to?Assuming you've given a go, and the first thing youmight have realized is we're trying to get the averagevalue of a function that we don't know explicitly at.We know the position functionbut not the acceleration function.But luckily, we also know that the acceleration functionis derivative with respective time of the velocity functionwhich is the derivative with respectto time of the position function.The acceleration function is the second derivative of this.We have to just find its average value over this interval.Let's do that.Let's take the derivative of this twice.But before we do that, let me just even rewrite this.It's just going to be a little biteasier to differentiate it.If we just take each of these two terms in the numeratorand divide them by t squared, we're going to get tto the third, divided by t-squared is just the t.Then two divided by T squared, we could write thatas plus two t to the negative two power.Now, let's take the derivative.The velocity function, as the velocity as the functionof time, just the derivative with this with respect to time.It's going to be derivative of t with respect to t as one.Derivative of two t to the negative two.Let's see, negative two times positive two is negative four.T to the, we just decremented the exponent here,t to the negative three power.Now, to find acceleration as a function of time, we justfind, take the derivative of this with respect to time.Acceleration as a function of time is equal to,actually it's already used at color for the averageso let me do a different color now.Acceleration has a function of time is justthe derivative of this with respect to t.Derivative of a constant with respectto time was not changing so it's a zero.Then over here, negative three timesnegative four is positive 12, times t to the,let's decrement that exponent to the negative four power.Now to find the average value, all we have to do now,average value is essentially take the definitive roleof this over the interval, and divide thatby the width of the interval.Or we could say, we could take,we can divide by the width of the interval.One, over two minus one,and this also simplifies to one.Times the definitive role of the interval.One to two of a of t which is,so this could be 12 t to the negative four power d t.What is this simplified to?Once again, this is one over one.That's just going to be one.We take the antiderivative of this.Let me just, so this is going to be equal tothe antiderivative of this is, so we go t to the negativethree power but we divide by negative three.An antiderivative of this is going to be, if we don'ttake that, an antiderivative is going to be negative fourt to the negative three power, and we saw that over here.Obviously, if you were really just taking an in-definitiverole, we would have to put some concept here.But in the definitive role, if we put a concept here,Assuming the same concept that we get canceled outwhen you actually do a calculation, but the entirederivative of this, we increment the exponent,and then we divide by that new exponent.Twelve divided by negative three is negative four.We are going to evaluate that from two and that one.This is going to be equal to, when we evaluated it at twoat the upper bound of our intervals, it could benegative four times two to the negative three powers.It's negative four times, what is that?Two, that's one over to the third of times 1/8,is one way to think about that.Then we are going to have minus this evaluated one.Minus negative four times t to the negative threeof one to the negative three is just one.This is going to be negative four times one.This is going to be equal to,or really in the homestretch now,this is equal to, this part rightover here, is negative 1/2.This is negative 1/2, and this partright over here is positive four.Positive four minus 1/2.We could either write that as three and a half,or if we wanted to write that as an improper fraction,we could write this as 7/2.The average value of our accelerationover this interval is 7/2.If this position was given a meters and time was in seconds,then this would be 7/2 meters per seconds squared,is the average acceleration between timein one second and time at two seconds.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-integrals/v/area-under-rate-net-change	khanacademy	video	":00- [Voiceover] Let's say that something is travelingat a constant rate of five meters per second.That's its velocity in one dimension.If it was negative, we'd be moving to the left.If it's positive, it's moving to the right.Let's say that we care about what is our changein distance over, the delta symbol represents change,over a change in time of four seconds.Over four seconds.I could say from t equal zero to t is equal to four.That's our change in time.That's our four-second interval that we care about.Well, one way to think about it is what a rateby definition is nothing but a change in some quantity.In this case, it's distance overa change in some other quantity.In this case, we're thinking about time.Or another way to think about it, if we multiplyboth sides times change in time, you get your changein distance is equal to your rate times change in time.This is very close to you, you might rememberfrom pre-algebra, distance is equal to rate times time.Time, that just comes from the definition of what a rate is.It's a change in one quantitywith respect to another quantity.If you just apply this, you can say,""Okay, my rate is a constant five meters""per second and my delta t is four seconds.""So times four seconds.Well, that's just going to give you 20.That's just going to get you 20.Let me do that in same colorthat I had for the change in distance.That's going to be 20.Then the seconds, cancel the seconds, 20 meters.So my total change in distance over thosefour seconds is going to be 20 meters.Nothing new here.Nothing too fancy.But I want to do now is connect this to the areaunder the rate function over this time period.So let's graph that.Let's graph it.That's my rate axis.This is my time axis.This is going to be in seconds.This is going to be in meters per second.Let's see, one, two, three, four, five.Let's see if it's about enough,and then I go one, two, three, four, five.Our rate, at least in this example, is a constant, isa constant five meters per second.It's a constant five meters per second.That is my r of t in this example.What did we just do here?We just multiplied our change in timetimes our constant rate.We just multiplied our change in time.So from time equal zero seconds to four seconds.It's this length here,if we think on that axis.Now we multiply it times our constant rate.We multiply it times this right over here.If I multiply this base times this height,what am I going to get?I'm going to get this area under the rate function.Now that area is going to be 20.If we went with the units of them, obviously you're usedto things of area being something units squaredbecause it's usually meters times metersor miles times miles or inches times inches so it'll beinches squared, meters squared, or miles squared.But here if we go at the units of the axis of the metersper second times seconds which is going to get you meters.But the important thing here isthat the units here or the area here is 20.So this for that very simple example, it looks like the areaunder the rate curve is equal to the net changeover that time period where the rate issomething with respect to time.Well let's test the little burrow.It's just going to be more intuition here.Let's say that we have a different rate function.Let's say that we will make with the different,let's say instead we had a rate function.I'll use on this yellow.Let's say on a rate function, that is...Let me make it a little bit interesting.Let's say it's one meter per second,for our time is zero is less than or equal to timewhich is less than or equal to two seconds.Honestly, this is all in seconds where we're of time.There's two meters per second,for t is greater than two seconds.What's that going to look like?Actually, try to graph it yourself, and just say,""Well, what is the total change in distance""over the first, let's say five seconds?""We want to do delta t over, not the firstfour seconds but the first five seconds.Well, let's graph it.Let's graph it.So this is one meter per second.One meter per second.That is two meters per second.That's in meters per second.That's my rate axis.This right over there is going to be my time axis.One, they're obviously not of the same scale,three, four, five.What is this rate function look like?Well, my rate is one meter per secondbetween time is zero and two, including two seconds,and then the rate jumps.Nothing can accelerate instantly like this.You'd need an infinite force or an infinitelysmall mass I guess to, or maybe there'ssomething that's thinking about...Anyway, I only get two complex herebut this is unrealistic mode.It's not typical for something to just have spontaneousvelocity increase like that but let's just go with it.Then after the two seconds, we areat a constant rate of two meters per second.Now, what is our total change in distanceover the first five seconds here?So here, we care about the first five seconds,or we can break up the problem.We could say, ""Well, over the first two seconds.""Change in time is two seconds,times our constant rate over those two seconds.It's going to be two seconds times one meter per second.Well, that's going to give us two meters.So this here is going to be,shall we do that in orange color,that's going to give us two meters there,and then we look at the next section.Our change in time here is three seconds,and then we multiply that, times our constanttwo meters per second.That's going to give us an area of six.If we look at the units, in both cases,we're multiplying seconds times metersper second which is going to give us meters.This is going to be two plus six meters or eight meters.So hopefully this is giving you the intuition that the areaunder the rate curve or the rate function isgoing to give you our total net change in whateverthat rate thing was finding the rate of.In this case, it is distance per unit time.If you take the area under the rate function,that kind of distance for the speed or this velocityfunction over some period of time, that area isgoing to be our total net change in distance."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-integrals/v/interpreting-definite-integral-as-net-change	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] In a previous videowe started to get an intuition for rate curvesand what the area under a rate curve represents.So, for example, this rate curve,this might represent a speed of a carand how a speed of a car is changing with respect to time.And so this shows us that our rate is actually changing,this isn't distance as function of time,this is rate as a function of time.So, this looks like car is accelerating.At time one it is going ten meters per secondand at time five, let's assume that all of theseare in seconds, so at five seconds,it is going 20 meters per second.So, it is is accelerating.Now the relationship between the rate function and the area,is that if we're able to figure out this area,then that is the change in distance of the car.So rate or speed in this case is distance per unit time,if we're able to figure out the area under that curve,it will actually give us our change in distance,from time one to time five.It won't tell us our total distance,cause we won't know what happens before time one,if we're not concerned with that area.And the intuition for that, it's a little bit easierif you're dealing with rectangles.But just think about this, let's make a rectanglethat looks like a pretty good approximation for the area,let's say from time one to time two right over here.Well what is this area from the rectangle represent?To figure out the area we would multiply one second,that would be the width here, times roughly,looks like about ten meters per second.And so the units here would be ten meters per second,times on second, or ten meters.And we know from early physics or even before,that if you multiply a rate times time,or a speed times a time, you're gonna get a distance.And so the unit here is in distance,as you can see, this area is going to represent,it's gonna be an approximation for the distance traveled.And so, if you wanted to get an exact version,or an exact number for the distance traveled.You would get the exact area under the curve.And we have a notation for that.If you want the exact area under the curve right over here,we use definite integral notation.This area right over here,we can denote as a definite integralfrom one to five, of R of t, dt.And once again, what does this represent?In this case when our rate is speed?This represents this whole expression reprsentsour change in distance from t is equal to one,to t is equal to five.Now with that context, let's actually try to do an exampleproblem, the type that you might see on Khan Academy.So, this right over here tells us,Eden walked at a rate of r of t kilometers per hour,where t is the time in hours.Okay, so t is in hours.What does the integral, the definite integralfrom two to three of r of t dt equals six mean?So before I even look at these choices,this is saying, so this is going from t equals two hoursto t equals three hours and it's essentially the areaunder the rate curve and here the rate is,we're talking about a speed.Eden is walking at a certain number of kilometers per hour.So what this means, that from time two hoursto time three hours, Eden walked an extra six kilometers.So, let's see which of these choices match that.Eden walked six kilometers each hour?It does tell us from time two to three,Eden walked six kilometers, but it doesn't mean,but we don't know what happened from time zero to time one,or from time one to time two.So I would rule this out.Eden walked six kilometers in three hours.So this is a common misconception,people will look at the top boundand say okay, this area represented by the definite integralthis tells us how far in totalwe have walked up until that point.That is not what this represents.This represents the change in distancefrom time two to time three.So, I'll rule that out.Eden walked six kilometers during the third hour.Yes, that's what we've been talking about.From time equal two hours to time equal three hours,Eden walked six kilometers and you could view thatas the third hour, going from time two to time three.Eden's rate increased by six kilometers per hourbetween hours two and three.So let's be very clear, this right over here,this isn't a rate, this is the area under the rate curve,this is what this definite integral is representing.And so this isn't telling us about our rate changing,this is telling us how does the thing that the rateis measuring the change of, how does that changefrom time two to time three?So we would rule that out as well.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-integrals/v/analyzing-problems-involving-definite-integrals	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The population of a towngrows at a rate ofr of t is equal to 300times e to the 0.3tpeople per year,where time, where t is time in years.At time t is equal to twothe town's population is 1,200 people.What is the town's population at t is equal to seven?Which expression can we use to solve the problem?So they don't want us to actually answer the question.They just want us to set up the expressionusing some symbols from calculus.So why don't you pause this videoand try to think about it.So let's just remind us what they've given us.They've given us the rate function right over here.And so if you want to finda change in populationfrom one timeto another time,what you could do is you could take the integralof the rate functionfrom the starting time,t is equal to two years,to t is equal to seven years.So we're gonna take the integral of the rate function,and what this is going to tell us,this is going to tell us the change in populationfrom time two to time seven.So this is,we could say let me just write this,this is the change.I'll use delta for change or I'll just let mejust write it out,change in population, change in population,population.But they don't want us to, we don't,they don't, they're not asking usfor the change in population.They want us to know what is the town's populationif t is equal to seven.So what you would want is,you would want what your population is at t equals twoplus the change in population from two to sevento get you your population at seven.So they tell us the population at time t equals two,the town's population is 1,200 people.So if you want the population at t is equal to seven,it's going to be1,200 plus how whatever the change in population is.You take the integral of the rate function,you are, and this is the rate of population,this integral is gonna give you the change in populationfrom time t equals two to t equals seven.So we can see clearly that is choice D right over here.These other choices, we could look at 'em really quick.Choice b is just the change in population.Assuming that this, and this is actually increasing,so this would tell us how much did the population increasefrom t two, from t equals two to t equals seven.So that's not what we want.We want what the actual population is.This is how much the population increasesfrom time zero to time seven.Now you might say well wouldn't that bethe town's population?Well that would be the town's populationif they had no people at time zero,but you can't assume that.Maybe the town got settled by 10 people or by 1,000 peopleor who knows whatever else.So right over there.And this is taking the derivative of the rate function,which is, it's actually a little hardto think about what is this.This is the rate of change of the rateat time seven minus the rate of change of the rateat time two.So I would rule that one out as well.Let's do one more of these.So here we have,the depth of water in a tankis changing at a rate of r of tis equal to 0.3t centimeters per minute,where t is the time in minutes.At time t equals zero,the depth of the water is 35 centimeters.What is the change in the water's depthduring the fourth minute?So let's pause the video again and see if you canfigure this out again,or figure out what expression can we useto solve the problem,the problem being what is the changein the water's depthduring the fourth minute.Alright so we've just talked about if you're trying to findthe change in a value,you could take the integral of the rate functionover the appropriate time.So we're talking about during the fourth minute,so we definitely wanna take the integralof the rate function.We just have to think about the bounds.And all the choices here are taking the integralof the rate function.So really the interesting part is,during the fourth minute.So let me just draw a little number line here,and we can think about what the fourth minute looks like.Or actually let me just draw the whole thing.So let's say this is r of t right over there,I could say y is equal to r of t,and this is, this is t.And let's see, the first minute goes from zero to one,second minute goes from one to two,third minute goes from two to three,fourth minute goes from three to four.The rate function, this actually just looks likea straight up linear rate function, something like this.And so what is the fourth minute?Well the fourth minute is the first minute is this one,second, third, fourth.The fourth minute is going from minute three to minute four.So it's what we wanna do is the expression that gives usthis area right over here under the rate curve.Well this is our lower bound's going to be three,and our upper bound is going to be four.And so there you have it,it is this first choice.You might have been tempted here if you gota little bit confused,hey maybe the fourth minute is after we've crossedthe t is equal to four,but no that would be the fifth minute.This would tell us,this would tell us our change over the first four minutes,not just during the fourth minute.And then this, well this is just gonna be zero.If you're taking, this is,what is the change in the value from three to three.Well it didn't change at all,because it's essentially at an instant,there's no time that passes from three to three.So you can rule all of these out.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-non-motion-applications-of-integrals/v/definite-integral-word-problem	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We are told the population of a towngrows at a rate of e to the 1.2t powerminus two t people per year where t is the number of years.At t equals two years, the town has 1,500 people.First, they ask us approximately by how many peopledoes the population growbetween t equals two and t equals five,and then what is the town's populationat t equals five years.If we actually figure out this first question,the second question is actually pretty straight-forward.We figure out the amount that it grows,and then add it to what we were at at t equals two,add it to 1,500.So pause this video and see if you can figure it out.The key here is to appreciate that this right over hereis expressing the rate of how fastthe population is growing.And we've then seen in multiple videos now,let me just draw, do a quick reviewof this notion of a rate curve.So those are my axes, and this is my t-axis, my time axis.And so this is showing me how my rate of changechanges as a function of time.Let's say it's something like this.So once again, if I said at this timeright over here, this is my rate,this doesn't tell me, for example, what my population is.This tells me what is my rate of change of a population.And we have seen in previous videosthat if you wanna figure out the change in the thingthat the rate is the rate of change of, say,the change in population, you would find the areaunder the rate curve between those two appropriate times.And why does that make sense?Well, imagine a very small change in time right over here.If you have a very small change in time,and if you assume that your rate is approximately constantover that very small change in time,well, then your change in, let's say we're measuringthe rate of change of population here,your accumulation, you could say,is going to be your rate times your change in time,which would be the area of this rectangle.And so roughly that would be the area under the curveover that very, very small change in time.What we really wanna do is find the area under this curvefrom t equals two to t equals five.And we have seen multiple times in calculushow to express that.So the definite integral from t is equal to twoto t is equal to five of this expressionof e to the 1.2t minus two t dt, dt.So, if we just evaluate that, that will be the answerto this first question.So what is this going to be?Well, let's actually work it out.So what is the antiderivative of e to the 1.2t?Well, let me just try to do it over here.So if I am trying to calculate,let me write it as e to the five, or actually 6/5 t.Say, 12/10 is the same thing as 6/5.6/5 t dt, so this is an indefinite integral,I'm just trying to figure out the antiderivative here.Well, if I had a 6/5 right over here,then use substitution, or sometimes you would saythe inverse chain rule, would be very appropriate.Well, we could put a 6/5 thereif we write a 5/6 right over here.5/6 times 6/5, then we can take constantsin and out of the integral like this.Scaling constants, I should say.Well, now, so this is going to be equal to 5/6,this 5/6 right over here.This antiderivative is pretty straight-forward.Since I have the derivative of 6/5 t right over here,I can find the antiderivative with respect to 6/5 t,which is essentially I'm doing u-substitution.If you have to do u-substitution, you would make thatright over there u, and then that and that would be your du.But, needless to say, this would be5/6 times e to the 6/5 t, and if you're thinking aboutthe indefinite integral, you would then havea plus c here, of course.And you could verify that the derivative of thisis indeed e to the 1.2t.So this is going to be equal to,so this part right over here,the antiderivative is 5/6 e to the 6/5 t,and then this part right over here,the antiderivative of two t is t squared,so minus t squared.And we are going to evaluate that at five and twoand find the difference.So let's evaluate this at when t is equal to five.Well, you are going to, and let mecolor-code this a little bit.When t is equal to five you get5/6 times e to the 6/5 times five is e to the 6thminus five squared, so minus 25.And so from that I want to subtract.When we evaluate it at two we get5/6 e to the 6/5 times two is the same thingas 12/5, or we could say that's 2.4.2.4 minus four, two squared is four.And so what do we get?Well, there's a couple of ways that we could do this.So then we could write this as, let me write it this way,we could write this, so we have a 5/6 and a 5/6,so we could write this as 5/6 times e to the sixth,e to the sixth, minus e to the 2.4,minus 'cause we distribute that negative sign,e to the 2.4, e to the 2.4 power.And then we have minus 25, let me just get another colorto keep track of it.We have minus 25, and then you have minus negative four.So that would be plus four.So that would be minus 21.And I would need a calculator to figure this out,so let me do that.Let me get my calculator on this computer.And, there we go.And so let's see, if we wanna finde to the sixth power, that's 403, okay,now let me figure out, so minus, I would say,20, 2.4, that looks like a 24, I'll correct itas soon as I get back to that screen.E to that power, e to the 2.4 power.And I get equals, so what's in parenthesesis this number right here, so times 5/6.Times five divided by six is equal to that minus 21.Minus 21, is equal to this.So, if I round to the nearest hundredth it's going to beapproximately 306.00.So this is approximately 306.00.So approximately by how many people does the population growbetween t equals two and t equals five?Well, by approximately 306 people.Let me write that down.So approximately 306 people.And they say, what is the town's populationat t equals five.Well at time two at two years we had 1,500 people.And then we grow over this interval by 306, so plus 306.Well, that's gonna get me to,we deserve a little bit of a drum roll,1,806 people at t equals five years.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-vertical-area-between-curves/v/evaluating-simple-definite-integral	khanacademy	video	:00So we've got the function, f of x is equal to x squared.And what I'm concerned with, is finding the area under the curve,y is equal to f of x, so that's my y axis.This is my, my, x axis.Then let me draw my function.My function looks like this.At least in the, in the first quadrant.That's where I'll graph it for now.I could also graph it, obviously in the second quadrant.But, what I care about is the area under this curve and above the positive x axis,between, between x equals 1 and x equals 4, x equals 4.And I'm tired of approximating areas.I wanna find the exact area under this curve above the x axis.And the way we denote the exact area under thecurve, this little brown shaded area, is using the definite integral.The definite integral from 1 to 4 of f of x, dx.And the way that, or the way I conceptualizewhere this notation comes from, is we imagine abunch of infinite, an infinite number of infinitely thinrectangles that we sum up to find this area.Let me draw one of those infinitely thin rectangles, maybe not so infinitely thin.So, let me draw it like this.So, that would be one of the rectangles, that would be another rectangle.This should be reminiscent of a Riemann sum.In fact, that's where the Riemann integral comes from.Think of a Riemann sum where you have an infinite numberof these rectangles, where the width of each of the rectangles.This is how I conceptualize it, is dx, and the height of this rectangle is thefunction evaluated at an x that's within this interval right over here.And so, this part right over here is the area ofone of those rectangles, and we were summing them all up.And this kind of an elongated s, reminiscent of a sigma for summing.We're summing up the infinite number, of those infinitely thin rectangles,or the areas of those infinitely thin rectangles between 1 and 4.So that's where the notation of the definite integral comes from.But we still haven't done anything.We've just written some notation that says the exact area of the un-Between 1 and 4, under the curve f of x, and above the x axis.In order to actually do anything really productive with this, we have to turn tothe second fundamental theorem of calculus, sometimes calledpart two of the fundamental theorem of calculus.>> Which tells us, that if f has an antiderivative, so if wehave the antiderivative of f, so f of x is derivative,derivative of some function capital F of x, or another way of saying it is,f, capital F of x is the antiderivative,antiderivative of lower case f of x.Then I can evaluate this thing, and we doa whole video on conceptually understanding why this makes sense.We could evaluate this, by evaluating the antiderivativeof f, or an antiderivative of f, at 4.And from that, subtract the antiderivative evaluated at 1.So, let's do it for this particular case right over here.So we are taking, I'll just rewrite this statement.Instead of writing f of x, I'll write x squared.So, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x squared dx.Well, we're just gonna have to figure out what the antiderivative is.So if f of x is equal to x squared, what is capital F of x equal to?What is the antiderivative?Well, you might remember from your power rule, that if youtake the derivative with respect to x of x to thethird, you are going to get 3x squared, which is prettydarn close to x squared except for this factor of 3.So, let's divide both sides by 3.Let's divide both sides by 3, and you get the derivativeof x to the third divided by 3 is indeed x squared.Or, you can say this is the same thing as thederivative with respect to x of, x to the third over 3.Take the derivative of this.It'll be 3 times one third.And then you'll decrement the power, it'll just be x squared.So, this right over here, once again, is x squared.It's just equal to, just equal to x squared.So, in this case, our capital F of x, our antiderivative,is x to the third, x to the third over 3.And so we just have to evaluate that at 4 and at 1, and sometimes the way we would,the, the notation we would use is, we'll say that the antiderivative is xto the third over 3, and we're going to evaluate it, the one I, I alwaysjust like to write the numbers up here,at 4 and from that subtracted, evaluated at 1.Sometimes you'll see people write a little line here too,we'll say we're evaluate it at 4 and then at 1.But I'll just do it without the line.If we're gonna evaluate this thing at 4 and fromthat subtract it, subtract it evaluated at 1, so thisgoing to be equal to 4 to the third power is 64, so it's going to be 64 over 3.Let me color code it, this is, this right over here, is this, rightover there and then from that, we'regoing to subtract this business evaluated at one.Well, when you evaluate it at 1, you get 1 to the third is one over 3.You get one third.So just to be clear, this is this right over there.And then we are ready to just subtract these fractions.64 over 3, minus one third, is equal to 63 over 3.And 3 goes into 63 exactly, exactly 21 times.So, whatever the units are, the area of this brown area is 21 square units.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-vertical-area-between-curves/v/definite-integrals-and-negative-area	khanacademy	video	:00What I've got here is the graph of y is equal to cosine of x.What I want to do is figure out the areaunder the curve y is equal to f of x, and above the x-axis.I'm going to do it over various intervals.So first, let's think about the area under the curve,between x is equal to 0 and x is equal to pi over 2.So we're talking about this area right over here.Well, the way we denote it is the definite integral from 0to pi over 2 of cosine of x dx.And remember, all this is, is kind of,it's reminiscent of taking a sum of a bunchof super thin rectangles with width dx and heightf of x for each of those rectangles.And then you take an infinite numberof those infinitely thin rectangles.And that's kind of what this notation is trying to depict.But we know how to do this already.The second fundamental theorem of calculus helps us.We just have to figure out what the antiderivative of cosineof x is.Or what an antiderivative of cosine of x is.Evaluate it at pi over 2, and from thatsubtract it evaluated at 0.So what's the antiderivative of cosine of x?Or what's an antiderivative?Well, we know if we take the derivative-- letme write this up here.We know that if we take the derivative of sine of x,we get cosine of x.So the antiderivative of cosine of x is sine of xNow, why do I keep saying sine of x is an antiderivative?It's not just the antiderivative.Well, I could also take the derivativeof sine of x plus any arbitrary constant,and still get cosine of x.Because the derivative of a constant is 0.This could be pi, this could be 5, this could be a million,this could be a googol, this could be any crazy number.But the derivative of this is still going to be cosine x.So when I say that we just have to find an antiderivative, I'mjust saying, look, we just have to find one of the derivatives.Sine of x is probably the simplest, because in this casethe constant is 0.So let's evaluate.So one way that we can denote this,the antiderivative cosine, or an antiderivative of cosineof x is sine of x.And we're going to evaluate at pi over 2.And from that, subtract and evaluate it at 0.So this is going to be equal to-- letme do it right over here.This is going to be equal to sine of pi over 2 minussine of 0, which is equal to sine of pi over 2 is 1.Sine of 0 is 0.So it's 1 minus 0 is equal to 1.So the area of this region right over here, this areais equal to 1.Now let's do something interesting.Let's think about the area.Let's think about the area under the curve between,let's say pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2.So between here and here.So we're talking about this area.We're talking about that area right over here.This is 3 pi over 2.So once again, the way we denote the areais the definite integral from pi over 2 to 3 pi over 2 of cosineof x dx.The antiderivative-- or an antiderivative of cosine of xis sine of x.Evaluated at 3 pi over 2 and pi over 2.So this is going to be equal to sineof 3 pi over 2 minus sine of pi over 2.What's sine of 3 pi over 2?If we visualize the unit circle really fast, 3 pi over 2is going all the way 3/4 around the unit circle.So it's right over there.So sine is the y-coordinate on that unit circle.So it's negative 1.So this right over here is negative 1.This right over here, sine of pi over 2is just going straight up like that.So sine of pi over 2 is 1.So this is interesting.We get negative 1 minus 1, which is equal to negative 2.We've got a negative area here.We got a negative area.Now how does that make sense?We know in the real world, areas are always positive.But what is negative 2 really trying to depict?Well, it's trying to sign it based on the ideathat now our function is below the x-axis.So we could kind of think we have an area of 2,but it's all below the x-axis in this case.And so it is signed as negative 2.The actual area is 2, but since it's below the x-axis,we get a negative right over here.Now let's do one more interesting one.Let's find the definite integral from 0to 3 pi over 2 of cosine of x dx.Now this is just denoting this entire area.Going from 0 all the way 3 pi over 2.And what do you think is going to happen?Well, let's evaluate it.It's going to be sine of 3 pi over 2 minus sine of 0.Which is equal to negative 1 minus 0,which is equal to negative 1.So what just happened here?The area under, all this orange area that I just outlined,is clearly not negative, or any area isn't a negative number.And the area isn't even 1.But what just happened here?Well, we saw in the first case that this first area was 1.The area of this first region right over here is 1.And then the area of the second region, we got negative 2.And so one way to interpret it isthat your net area above the x-axis is negative 1,or another way to say it, your net area is negative 1.So it's taking the 1 region above the x-axisand subtracting the 2 below it.So what the definite integral is doingwhen we evaluate it using the second fundamental theoremof calculus, it's essentially findingthe net area above the x-axis.And if we get a negative number, thatmeans that the net area is act-- that actually most of the areais below the x-axis.If we get 0, then that means it all nets out.And if you want to see a case that's 0,take the integral from 0 all the way all the way 2 pi.And this will evaluate to 0 because you have an area of 1and another area of 1, but it nets outwith this area of negative 2.Let's try that out.So if we go from 0 to 2 pi of cosine of x dx,this is going to be equal to sine of 2 pi minus sine of 0,which is equal to 0 minus 0, which is indeed equal to 0.Now clearly there was area here, but allof the area that was above the x-axisnetted out with all the area that was below the x-axis.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-vertical-area-between-curves/v/area-between-curves	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] We have already coveredthe notion of area between a curve and the x-axisusing a definite integral.We are now going to then extend thisto think about the area between curves.So let's say we care about the regionfrom x equals a to x equals bbetween y equals f of x and y is equal to g of x.So that would bethis area rightover here.So based on what you already knowabout definite integrals,how would you actually try to calculate this?Well one natural thing that you might sayis well look,if I were to take the integralfrom a to bof f of x dx,that would give me the entire areabelow f of xand above the x-axis.And then if I were to subtract from thatthis area right over here,which is equal tothat's the definite integral from a to bof g of x dx.Well then I would net out with the original areathat I cared about.I would net out with this area right over here.And that indeed would be the case.And we know from our integration propertiesthat we can rewrite this asthe integral from a to bof, let me put some parentheses here,of f of xminus g of x,minus g of xdx.And now I'll make a claim to you,and we'll build a little bit more intuition for thisas we go through this video,but over an integral from a to bwhere f of x is greater than g of x,like this interval right over here,this is always going to be the case,that the area between the curvesis going to be the integralfor the x-interval that we care about, from a to b,of f of x minus g of x.So I know what you're thinking,you're like okay well that worked when both of themwere above the x-axis,but what about the case when f of xis above the x-axis and g of xis below the x-axis?So for example,let's say that we were to think about this intervalright over here.Let's say this is the point c,and that's x equals c,this is x equals d right over here.So what if we wanted to calculatethis area that I amshading in right over here?You might say well does this actually work?Well let's think about nowwhat the integral,let's think about what the integralfrom c to d of f of x dx represents.Well that would represent this area right over here.And what would the integral from c to dof g of x dx represent?Well you might say it isthis area right over here,but remember,over this interval g of x is below the x-axis.So this would give you a negative value.But if you wanted this total area,what you could do is take this blue area,which is positive,and then subtract this negative area,and so then you would get the entire positive area.Well this just amounted to,this is equivalent to the integralfrom c to dof f of x,of f of x minus g of x again,minus g of x.Let me make it clear, we've got parentheses there,and then we have our dx.So once again,even over this interval when one of,when f of x was above the x-axisand g of x was below the x-axis,we it still boiled down to the same thing.Well let's take another scenario.Let's take the scenario when they are bothbelow the x-axis.Let's say that we wanted to go fromx equals, well I won't use e since that is aloaded letter in mathematics, and so is f and g.Well let's just say well I'm kinda of runningout of letters now.Let's say that I am gonna go fromI don't know, let's just call this m,and let's call this n right over here.Well n is getting, let's put n right over here.So what I care aboutis this area,the area once again below f.We're assuming that we're looking at intervalswhere f is greater than g,so below f and greater than g.Will it still amount to this with nowthe endpoints being m and n?Well let's think about it a little bit.If we were to evaluate that integralfrom m to nof, I'll just put my dx here,of f of xminus,minus g of x,we already know from our integral properties,this is going to be equal to the integralfrom m to nof f of x dxminus the integralfrom m to nof g of x dx.Now let's think about what each of these represent.So this yellow integral right over here,that would givethis the negative of this area.So that would give a negative value here.But the magnitude of it, the absolute value of it,would be this area right over there.Now what would just the integral,not even thinking about the negative sign here,what would the integral of this g of xof this blue integral give?Well that would give this the negativeof this entire area.But now we're gonna take the negative of that,and so this part right over here,this entire part including this negative sign,would give us,would give us this entire area,the entire area.This would actually give a positive valuebecause we're taking the negative of a negative.But if with the area that we care aboutright over here, the area that we cared about originally,we would want to subtract out this yellow area.Well this right over here,this yellow integral from,the definite integral from m to n of f of x dx,that's exactly that.That is the negative of that yellow area.So if you add the blue area,and so the negative of a negative is gonna be positive,and then this is going to be the negativeof the yellow area,you would net out once again to the areathat we think about.So in every case we saw,if we're talking about an intervalwhere f of x is greater than g of x,the area between the curvesis just the definite integral over that

https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-vertical-area-between-curves/v/area-between-curves-example	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to dousing our powers of calculusis find the area of this yellow regionand if at any point you get inspired,I always encourage you to pause the videoand try to work through it on your own.So, the key here is you might recognize hey,this is an area between curves.A definite integral might be useful,so I'll just set up the definite integral signand so, first we're gonna think about what are leftand right boundaries of our region?Well, it looks like the left boundaryis where the two graphs intersect right over hereand the right boundaryis where they intersect right over there.Well, what is this point of intersection?It looks like it is negative one, negative two.We can verify that.In this red curve, if X is negative one,let's see, you square that, you'll get one minus three.You do indeed get Y is equal to negative twoand in this blue functionwas X is equal to negative one,you get one minus four plus one.Once again, you do indeed get Y is equal to negative twoand the same thing is truewhen X is equal to one.One minus three, negative two,one minus four plus one, negative two.So, our bounds are indeed, we're going from Xequals negative one to X equals positive oneand now let's think about our upper and lower bounds.Over that interval this blue graphis our upper boundand so, we would subtract the lower boundfrom the upper bound,so we would have X to the fourth,minus four X squared plus oneand from that we will subtract X squaredminus three DXand in many other videos we have talkedabout why you do this,why this makes sense to just subtractthe lower graph from the upper graphwhen you're finding the area between thembut now we just have to evaluate this definite integral,so let's just get down to business.Alright, so we have the integral from negative one to one,and so, we have X to the fourth, X to the fourth,and now we have minus four X squaredand then when you distribute this negative sign,you're gonna subtract another X squared,so you're gonna have minus five X squaredand then you have plus oneand then you're gonna subtract a negative three,so it's gonna be one plus three,so it's gonna be plus four DX,DX and just to be clearI should put parentheses right over therebecause it's really the DX is being multipliedby this entire expressionand so, let's see, let's find the antiderivative of this.This should be pretty straightforward.We're just gonna use the reverse power rulemultiple times, so this is going to be the antiderivativeof X to the fourth is X to the fifth over five.We just incremented the exponentand divided by that incremented exponent,minus, same idea here,five X to the third over threeplus four Xand then we are going to evaluate itat one and then subtract from thatand evaluate it at negative one.So, let's first evaluate it at one.We're gonna get 1/5minus 5/3 plus fourand now let us evaluate it at negative one,so minus, let's see, if this is negative one,we get a negative 1/5, negative 1/5and this is gonna be plus 5/3,plus 5/3 and then this is going to be minus four,minus four but then when you distributethe negative sign, we're going to distribute thisover all of these terms,and so this is going to be,if we make this positive, this will be positive,this one will be negativeand then this one will be positive,so you have 1/5 plus 1/5which is going to be 2/5, that and that,and then minus 5/3, minus 5/3,so minus 10 over threeand then four plus four,so plus eightand so, we just need to simplify this.This is going to be, let's see,it's going to be eightand then if I write, so plus,I'm gonna write these two with a denominator of 15'cause that's the common denominator of three and five.Let's see, 2/5 is 16/15, yeah, that's right,five times three is 15.Two times three is sixand then 10/3, let's see, if we multiplythe denominator times fives,we have to multiply the numerator times five,so this is going to be 50/15and so, what's 6/15 minus 50/15?So, this is going to be equal to eightminus six minus 50 is minus 44,minus 44 over 15and so what is 44 over 15?44 over 15 is equal to two and 14/15,so that's really what we're subtracting.We're gonna subtract two and 14/15,so if you subtract two from thisyou would get six minus 14 over 15'cause we still have to subtract the 14/15and then six minus 14/15is going to be equal to five and 1/15.So, just like that, we were indeedable to figure out this area.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-vertical-area-between-curves/v/area-between-curves-with-multiple-boundaries	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video is find the area of this regionthat I'm shading in yellow.And what might seem challenging is that throughout this region,I have the same lower function.Or I guess the lower boundary is yis equal to x squared over 4 minus 1.But I have a different upper boundary.And the way that we can tackle thisis by dividing this area into two sections,or dividing this region into two regions, the region on the leftand the region on the right, wherefor this first region, which I'll do--I'll color even more in yellow-- for this first region,over that entire interval in x.And it looks like x is going between 0 and 1.y equals-- when x is equal to 1, this function is equal to 1.When x is equal to 1, this function is also equal to 1.So this is the point 1 comma 1.That's where they intersect.So for this section, this subregion right over here,y equals square root of x is the upper function the entire time.And then we can have a-- we can set upa different-- we can separately tackle figuring outthe area of this region.From x is equal to 1 to x is equal to 2,where y equals 2 minus x, is the upper function.So let's do it.So let's first think about this first region.Well, that's going to be the definite integral from xis equal to 0 to x is equal to 1.And our upper function is square root of x, so square root of x.And then from that, we want to subtract our lower function--square root of x minus x squared over 4 minus 1.And then of course, we have our dx.So this right over here, this is describing the area in yellow.And you could imagine it, that this part right over here,the difference between these two functionsis essentially this height.Let me do it in a different color.And then you multiply it times dx.You get a little rectangle with width dx.And then you do that for each x.Each x you get a different rectangle.And then you sum them all up.And you take the limit as your change in x approaches 0.So as you get ultra, ultra thin rectangles,and you have an infinite number of them.And that's our definition, or the Riemann definitionof what a definite integral is.And so this is the area of the left region.And by the exact same logic, we could figure outthe area of the right region.The right region-- and then we could justsum the two things together.The right region, we're going from x is equal to 0to x-- sorry, x is equal to 1 to x is equal to 2, 1 to 2.The upper function is 2 minus x.And from that, we're going to subtract the lower function,which is x squared over 4 minus 1.And now we just have to evaluate.So let's first simplify this right over here.This is equal to the definite integralfrom 0 to 1 of square root of x minus x squared over 4 plus 1,dx-- I'm going to write it all in one color now--plus the definite integral from 1 to 2 of 2 minus x,minus x squared over 4.Then subtracting a negative is a positive 3-- or a positive 1.We could just add it to this 2.And so this 2 just becomes a 3.I said 2 minus negative 1 is 3, dx.And now we just have to take the antiderivativeand evaluate it at 1 and 0.So the antiderivative of this is-- well,this is x to the 1/2.Increment it by 1.Increment the power by 1, you get x to the 3/2,and then multiply by the reciprocalof the new exponent-- so it's 2/3 x to the 3/2.Minus-- the antiderivative of x squared over 4is x to the third, divided by 3, divided by 4, so divided by 12,plus x.That's the antiderivative of 1.We're going to evaluate it at 1 and 0.And then here the antiderivative isgoing to be 3x minus x squared over 2 minus xto the third over 12.Once again, evaluate it at-- or not once again.Now we're going to evaluate at 2 and 1.So over here, you evaluate all of this stuff at 1.You get 2/3 minus 1/12 plus 1.And then from that, you subtract this evaluated at 0.But this is just all 0, so you get nothing.So this is what the yellow stuff simplified to.And then this purple stuff, or this magenta stuff,or mauve, or whatever color this is, first you evaluate it at 2.You get 6 minus-- let's see, 2 squared over 2 is 2, minus 8over 12.And then from that, you're going to subtractthis evaluated at 1.So it's going to be 3 times 1-- that's 3-- minus 1/2 minus 1over 12.And now what we're essentially left withis adding a bunch of fractions.So let's see if we can do that.It looks like 12 would be the most obviouscommon denominator.So here you have 8/12 minus 1/12 plus 12/12.So this simplifies to-- what's this?This is 19/12, the part that we have in yellow.And then this business, let me do it in this color.So 6 minus 2, this is just going to be 4.So we can write this as 48/12-- that's 4-- minus 8/12.And then we're going to have to subtract a 3, which is 36/12.Then we're going to add to 1/2, which is just plus 6/12,and then we're going to add a 1/12.So this is all going to simplify to-- let's see, 48 minus 8is 40, minus 36 is 4, plus 6 is 10, plus 1 is 11.So this becomes plus 11/12.Let me make sure I did that right.48 minus 8 is 40, minus 36 is 4, 10, 11.So that looks right.And then we're ready to add these two.19 plus 11 is equal to 30/12.Or if we want to simplify this a little bit,we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 6.This is equal to 5/2, or 2 and 1/2.And we're done.We figured out the area of this entire region.It is 2 and 1/2.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-horizontal-area-between-curves/v/area-between-curve-and-y-axis	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So right over here,I have the graph of the function y is equal to 15 over x,or at least I see the part of it for positive values of x.And what I'm curious about in this video isI want to find the area not between this curveand the positive x-axis,I want to find the area between the curve and the y-axis,bounded not by two x-values, but bounded by two y-values,so with the bottom boundof the horizontal line y is equal to eand an upper bound with y is equal to e to the third power.So pause this video, and see if you can work through it.So one way to think about it,this is just like definite integrals we've donewhere we're looking between the curve and the x-axis,but now it looks like things are swapped around.We now care about the y-axis.So let's just rewrite our function here,and let's rewrite it in terms of x.So if y is equal to 15 over x,that means if we multiply both sides by x,xy is equal to 15.And if we divide both sides by y,we get x is equal to 15 over y.These right over here are all going to be equivalent.Now how does this right over help you?Well, think about the area.Think about estimating the areaas a bunch of little rectangles here.So that's one rectangle,and then another rectangle right over there,and then another rectangle right over there.So what's the area of each of those rectangles?So the width here, that is going to be x,but we can express x as a function of y.So that's the width right over there,and we know that that's going to be 15 over y.And then what's the height gonna be?Well, that's going to be a very small change in y.The height is going to be dy.So the area of one of those little rectanglesright over there, say the area of that one right over there,you could view as,let me do it over here, as 15 over y, dy.And then we want to sum all of these little rectanglesfrom y is equal to e,all the way to y is equal to e to the third power.So that's what our definite integral does.We go from y is equal to eto y is equal to e to the third power.So all we did, we're used to seeing things like this,where this would be 15 over x, dx.All we're doing here is, this is 15 over y, dy.So let's evaluate this.So we take the antiderivative of 15 over yand then evaluate at these two points.So this is going to be equal toantiderivative of one over yis going to be the natural log of the absolute value of y.So it's 15 times the natural logof the absolute value of y,and then we're going to evaluate that at our endpoints.So we're going to evaluate it ate to the thirdand at e.So let's first evaluate at e to the third.So that's 15 times the natural log,the absolute time, the natural, (laughs) the natural logof the absolute value of e to the third power minus15times the natural log of the absolute value of e.So what does this simplify to?The natural log of e to the third power,what power do I have to raise e to,to get to e to the third?Well, that's just going to be three.And then the natural log of e,what power do I have to raise e to, to get e?Well, that's just one.So this is 15 times three minus 15.So that is all going to get us to 30,and we are done, 45 minus 15.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-area-horizontal-area-between-curves/v/area-between-two-functions-of-y	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] So I have two curves graphed here.And we're used to seeing things where y is a function of x,but here we have x as a function of y.In fact, we can write this top expressionas being a function of y.And this second one, just to make it different,we could view this as g of y.Once again, it is a function of y.And what we're concerning ourselves with in this video ishow do we find this areain this light blue color between these two curves?And I encourage you to pause the videoand try to work through it.All right, so a huge hint here iswe're going to want to integrate with respect to y,a definite integral where our bounds are in terms of y.So for example, this is,this lower point of intersection right over here,this would be our lower bound in terms of y.Let's call that y one.And then,this up here, this would be our upper y bound.So if we think about where do these two curves intersect,and we look at the y-coordinates of those intersections,well, that gives us two nice bounds for our integral.So we're gonna take our integral from y one to y two,from y oneto y two,y two.We're going to integrate with respect to y, dy.And so what are we going to sum up?Well, when we integrate, we can think abouttaking the sum of infinitely thin rectangles.And in this case, it would infinitely flat rectanglessince we're thinking about dy.So dy would be the height of each of these rectangles.And what would be, in this case, the widthor the length of this rectangle right over here?Well, over this interval, from y one to y two,our blue function, f of y,takes on larger x-values than g of y.So this length right over here, this would be f of y,f of y,this x-value minus this x-value,minus g of y.So this is going to be f of yminus g of y,g of y.Well, we know what f of y and g of y are.Really, the trickiest part is,is figuring out these points of intersection.So let's think about where these two curves intersect.They are both equal to x,so we can set these two y expressions equal to each other.So we know that negative,let me do it in that other color,so we know that negative y squared plus three yplus 11 is going to be equal to this,is going to be equal to y squaredplus yminus one.So let's just subtract all of this from both sidesso that on the right side we have a zeroand on the left side we just have a quadratic.So let's subtract y squared.Let's subtract y.And then subtract negative one, which is just adding one.And over here, we're going to do the same thing,minus y plus one.And what we are left with is going to be a,hopefully, a straightforward quadratic.So let's see, this is going to be negative two y squaredplus two y.Am I doing that right?Yep, plus two y, plus 12is equal to zero.And then this over here I can factor out a negative two,and I get negative two times y squared minus yminus six is equal to zero.This we can factor from inspection.What two numbers, when we add, equal negative one?When we take their product, we get negative six?Well, that would be negative three and two.So this is going to be negative two times y minus threetimes y plus two.That's just straightforward factoring a polynomial,a quadratic.Did I do that right?Yep, that looks right, is equal to zero.So what are the points of intersection?The points of intersection are going to bey is equal to three and y is equal to negative two.So this right over here is y is equal to negative two,and then the upper bound is y is equal to three.So now we just have to evaluate this from negative two,all the way until three.So let's do that.I'm gonna clear this out,so I get a little bit of real estate.So this is equal to the integral fromnegative twoto three ofnegative y squared,plus three y,plus 11,minus all of this stuff.So if we just distribute a negative sign here,it's minus y squared,minus y, plus one,and then we have a dy,dy.This is equal to the definite integral fromnegative two to positive three of,let's see, negative y squared minus y squared,negative two y squared,and then three y minus y is going to be plus two y.And then 11 plus one, plus 12, we saw this just now,when we were trying to solve for y, dy.And so what is that going to be equal to?Well, we just take the antiderivative here.This is going to be, let's see, negative two.Let's increment the exponent, y to the third.Divide by that exponent, reverse power rule,plus two y squared divided by two, which is just y squared,just the reverse power rule,and then plus 12 y.And we're going to evaluate that at threeand at negative two.So if we evaluate that at three, we are going to get,let's see, negative twotimes 27over three,plus nine,plus 36.And then we are going to want to subtract, minusall of this evaluated at negative two.So it's going to be negative two times negative eightover three,plus four,minus 24.So we just have a little bit of mathematics ahead of us.So let's see,this is going to be 27 divided by three is nine.So this is negative 18.Negative 18plus nine is going to be negative nine,plus 36, all of that is going to be equal to,so the stuff in blue is equal to 27.Right, did I do that right?Get negative 18 plus nine, yep, 27.And then all the stuff in red over here,we have, this is going to be negative times a negative,so it's 16 over three, plus four, minus 24.So that is going to be 16over three,and then minus,minus 20,minus 20.But then we have this negative out here, so it's,if we distribute that, we'll get plus 20,minus, we could say instead of 16 over three,we could rewrite that as 5 1/3,minus 5 1/3.And so what is that going to get us?Let me scroll down a little bit, or let me go to the right,so I have a little bit more real estate here.So then that is going to be equal to,get a minor drum roll here, 47minus fiveminus 1/3,which is equal to, let's see, 47 minus five, that's 42,minus 1/3 is, now we get a drum roll,41 2/3.And we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-squares-and-rectangles-cross-sections/v/volume-with-cross-sections-intro	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] You are likely already familiarwith finding the area between curves.And, in fact, if you're not,I encourage you to review that on Khan Academy.For example, we could find this yellow areausing a definite integral.But what we're going to do in this videois do something even more interesting.We're gonna find the volume of shapeswhere the base is defined in some wayby the area between two curves.And, in this video, we're gonna think about a shape,and I'm gonna draw it in three dimensions.So let me draw this over again,but with a little bit of perspective.So,let's make this the y-axis.So that's the y-axis.This is my x-axis.That is my x-axis.This is theline y is equal to sixright over there.Y is equal to six.This dotted line, we could just draw it like this,and so this would be the point x equals two.And then the graph of y is equal to fourtimes the natural log of three minus xwould look something like this,look something like this.And so this region is this region,but it's going to be the baseof a three-dimensional shape where any cross section,if I were to take a cross section right over here,is going to be a square.So whatever this length is, we also go that much high,and so the cross section is a square right over there.The cross section right over here is going to be a square.Whatever the difference between these two functions is,that's also how high we are going to go.This length, which is six at this point,this is also going to be the height.It is going to be a square.It's going to be quite big,might have to scroll down so we can draw the whole thing,roughly at the right proportion.So it looks something like this.This should be a square.It's gonna look something like this.And so the whole shape would look,would look somethinglike this,would look something like that,try to shade that in a little bit so that you canappreciate it a little bit more,but hopefully you get the idea.And some of you might be excited,and some of you might be a little intimidated.Well, hey, I've been dealingwith the two dimensions for so long.What's going on with these three dimensions?But you'll quickly appreciate that you already havethe powers of integration to solve this.And to do that, we just have to break up the shapeinto a bunch of these, you could view them as these littlesquare tiles that have some depth to them.So let's make that into a little tile, this one into it,that also has some depth to it.You could even, I could draw it multiple places.You could view it as a,break it up into these things that have a very small depth,that we could call dx.And we know how to figure out what their volume is.What would be the volume of one of these things?Well, it would be the depth times the area,times the surface areaof this cross section right over here.Let me do that in a different color.So what would be the areathat I am shading in in pink right over here?Well, that area is going to be the base length squared.What's the base length?Well, it's the difference between these two functions.It is going to be six minus,our bottom function is fourtimes the natural log of three minus x,and so that would just give us that length.But if we square it, we get this entire area.We get that entire area, you square it.And then you multiply it times the depth.You multiply it times the depth.Now you have the volume of just this littlesection right over here,and I think you might see where this is going.Now, what if you were to add up all of thesefrom x equals zero to x equals two?Well, then you would have the volume of the entire thing.This is the power of the definite integral.So we could just integratefrom x equals zero to x equals two,from x equals zero to x equals two.If you drew where these intersect our base,you would say all right, this thing right over herewould be this thingright over here, where it's dx.And instead of just multiplying dxtimes the difference between these functions,we're going to square the difference of these functions'cause we're visualizing this three-dimensional shape,the surface area of this three-dimensional shape,as opposed to just the height of this little rectangle.And if you were to evaluate this integral,you would indeed get the volume of this,this kind of pedestal horn-looking thing.This is not an easy definite integral to evaluate by hand,but we can actually use a calculator for that.And so,we canhit mathand then hit choice number nine for definite integral,and then we just have to input everything.We're going from zero tilltwo of,and then we have, let me open parentheses'cause I'm gonna have to square everything.Six minus four times the natural logof x,or actually the natural log of three minus x.And so let me close the parentheses on the natural log part.And then, if I close the parentheses on this whole thing,I want to then square it.And then I'm integrating with respect to x.Enter, I got approximately 26.27.So approximately 26.27, and this is a volume here.So if we thought about units,it would be in our units cubed or cubic units.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-squares-and-rectangles-cross-sections/v/volume-from-cross-sections-without-graph-shown	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] The base of a solid is the region enclosedby the graphs of y is equal to negative x squaredplus six x minus one and y is equal to four.Cross sections of the solid perpendicular to the x-axisare rectangles whose height is x.Express the volume of the solid with a definite integral.So pause this video, and see if you can have a go at that.All right, now what's interesting about thisis they've just given us the equations for the graphs,but we haven't visualized them yet.And we need to visualize them, or at least I liketo visualize them so I can think about this regionthat they're talking about.So maybe a first thing to do is think about,well, where do these two lines intersect?So when do we have the same y-value?Or another way to think about it iswhen does this thing equal four?So if we set them equal to each other,we have negative x squaredplus six x minus one is equal to four.This will give us the x-valueswhere these two lines intersect.And so we will get, if we want to solve for x,we can subtract four from both sides.Negative x squared plus six x minus five is equal to zero.We can multiply both sides by negative one.We will get x squared minus six xplus five is equal to zero.And then this is pretty straightforward to factor.One times five is five,or actually I say negative one times negative five is five.And negative one plus negative five is negative six.So it's going to be x minus onetimes x minus five is equal to zero.And so these intersect when x is equal to oneor x is equal to five.Since we have a negative out frontof the second-degree term right over here,we know it's going to be a downward-opening parabola.And we know that we intersect y equals fourwhen x is equal to one and x equals five.And so the vertex must be right in between them,so the vertex is going to be at x equals three.So let's actually visualize this a little bit.So it's going to look something like this.I'll draw it with some perspective 'cause we're gonna haveto think about a three-dimensional shape.So that's our y-axis.This isourx-axis.And let me draw some y-values.So one,two,three,four,five,six,seven, eight.This is probably sufficient.Now we have y is equal to four,which is going to look something like this.So that isy is equal to four.And then we have y is equal to negative x squaredplus six x minus one, which we know intersectsy equals four at x equals one or x equals five.So let's see, one,two,three,four,five.So x equals one, so we have that point right over there.One comma four, and then we have five comma four.And then we know the vertex is when x is equal to three,so it might look something like this.We could substitute three back in here.So let's see, y will equal to negative nine,three squared,plus 18minus one.And so what is that going to be?That's going to be y is going to be equal to eight.So we have the point three comma eight.So this is five, six, seven, eight, yep, right about there.And so we are dealing with a situation,we're dealing with a situation that lookssomething like this.This is the region in question.So that's going to be the base of our solid.And they say cross sections of the solidperpendicular to the x-axis,so let me draw one of those cross sections.So this is a cross section perpendicular to the x-axis,are rectangles, whose height is x,so this is going to have height x right over here,height x.Now what is this, the width, I guess we could say,of this rectangle?Well, it's going to be the differencebetween these two functions.It's going to be these,this upper function minus this lower function.So it's going to be, that right over there is goingto be negative x squared plus six x minus oneand then minus four,minus the lower function.So that could be simplified as negative x squaredplus six x minus five.And so if we wanna figure out the volumeof this little section right over here,we'd multiply x times this,and then we would multiply thattimes an infinitesimal small,infinitesimally small depth, dx.And then we can just integrate from x equals oneto x equals five.So let's do that.The volume of just this little slice over hereis going to be the base,which is negative x squared plus six x minus five,times the height, times x,times the depth, times dx.And then what we wanna do is we wanna sum up all of these.So you could imagine right over here, you would have,or like right over here,you would have a cross section that looks like this.X is now much larger.The height is x, so now it looks something like this.So I'm just drawing two cross sections,just so you get the idea.So these are the,this is any one cross section for a given x,but now we want to integrate.Our x is going from x equals one to x equals five,x equals one to x equals five.And there you have it, we have expressed the volumeof that solid as a definite integral.And it's worth noting that this is,that this definite integral, if you distribute this x,if you multiply it by all of these terms,it's very solvable.You don't need a,or it's very solvable without a calculator.You're just going to get a polynomial over herethat you have to take the antiderivative ofin order to evaluate the definite integral.

This right over here is the graphof x plus y is equal to one.Let's say the region that's below this graphbut still in the first quadrant, that this is the baseof a three dimensional figure.So this region right over here is the baseof a three dimensional figure.What we know about this three dimensional figure isif we were to take cross sections that are perpendicularto the x axis, so cross sections I guess we could saythat are parallel to the y axis, so let's say we weretaking a cross-section like that,we know that this will be a semi-circle.If we take a slightly different viewof the same three-dimensional,we would see something like this.I've laid the coordinate plane down flatand I'm looking at it from above.This cross-section, if we're looking at it at an angle,and if the figure were transparent,it would be this cross-section right over here.It would be that cross-section right over here,which is a semi-circle.If we were to take this cross section right over here,along the y axis, that would be this cross section.This larger semi-circle.Given what I've just told you, I encourage you to pausethe video and see if you can figure outthe volume of this thing that I've shaded in a little bit.The volume of this thing that I've just started.This three dimensional figurethat we are attempting to visualize.I'm assuming you've had a go at it.One way to think about it is, well let's just thinkabout each of these, let's split up the figureinto a bunch of discs.If you figure out the volume of each of those discs,and sum them up then that would bea pretty good approximationfor the volume of the whole thing.Then, if you took the limit as you get an infinitenumber of discs that are infinitely thin,then you're going to get the exact volume.Let's just take the approximating case first.Let's say that right over here at x,what is going to be the diameter of the disc at x.Well, to think about that we just have to re-expressx plus y is equal to one.That's the same thing as saying that the functionthat F of x or y is equal to F of x is equal to one minus x.The diameter of this circle right over here,let me make it clear, the diameter of this circleis going to be this height, is going to be the differencebetween one minus x and the x axis,or between one minus x and x equals zero.This is just going to be, as a function of x,the diameter's going to be one minus x.Now, if you want to find the surface area for a circle,or if we want to find the area of a circle,we know that area is pi r-squared.For our semi-circle, you're going to divide by two.So what's the radius going to be?Just let me zoom in a little bit.What is the radius of one of these semi-circles going to be?The radius I could draw it like this.My best attempt to draw one of these things.It's gonna look something like this.I'm trying to draw it at an angle.The radius, what's gonna be half the diameter?The diameter is one minus x.The radius is going to be one minus x over two.Right, that distance is one minus x over two.That distance is one minus x over two.That distance is one minus x over two.So, that is one minus x over two is equal to the radius.What would be the area of of this side right over here?Well, if it was a full circle, it would be pi r-squared,but it's a semi-circle so it's pi r-squared over two.Let me write this, so the area is equal to pi r-squaredover two 'cause it's a semi-circle.In terms of x, our area as a function of x right over there,let me write it that way, our area as a function of x,is gonna be pi over two.It's gonna be pi over twotimes one minus x over two squared.It's one minus x over two squared.If I wanted a volume of just this disc right over here,I, then, multiply that area times the depth.I just multiply the area times this depth here.We could call that d x or we could call that delta x.We could call the depth there delta x.Actually, let me be clear, that's the area.The volume of one of those shells is going to be equalto, and I'll just write this in one color,is gonna be pi over two times one minus xover two squared, times the depth.The area times the depth.This is volume of one of these half discs.The volume of the whole thing we can approximate is the sumof these, or we can take the limit is our delta x's getmuch, much, much, much, smaller and we have an infinitenumber of these things, which is essentially,if we're taking that limit,we're gonna take the definite integral.We could take the definite integral,so the volume that we care about, the volume of this figure,is going to be equal to the definite integralfrom x equals zero to x equals one.That's where we intersect the x axis.X equals zero to x equals one of, we're integratingan infinite number of these things that are infinitely thin.It's going to be pi over two times,what's one minus x-squared?Let me just expand it out for fun right over here.That's the same thing as x minus one squared.So it's going to be x squared minus two x plus one,and then two squared is four, over four.Instead of delta x, I'm going to right d x now.I'm gonna write d x because I'm taking the limitas these become infinitely smalland I have an infinite nine.I'm summing an infinite number of them.The volume is just going to be, we just haveto evaluate this definite integral.If you feel so inspired, feel free to pauseand try to evaluate this definite integral.Let's just take some of these constants out.Let's take pi over eight out.Our volume is going to be equal to pi over eight timesthe definite integral from zero to oneof x-squared minus two x plus one d x,which is equal to pi over eight.The antiderivative of this is x to the third over threeminus x-squared plus x.We're going to evaluate that at zero and one.This is going to be equal to pi over eight.When you evaluate it at one,you get one third minus one plus one.It's going to be one third.When you evaluate at zero,you get zero minus zero plus zero.It's going to be minus zero so it's just pi over eight timesone third which is equal to pi over 24 and we are done.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-triangles-and-semicircles-cross-sections/v/volume-triangular-cross-section	khanacademy	video	:01- [Voiceover] Lets see if we can imaginea three-dimensional shapewhose base could be viewed asthis shaded in region betweenthe graphs of Y is equal to F of Xand Y is equal G of X.That's the base of our ...this purple, this I guess mauve or purple coloris the base of it.It's kind of popping out of our screen.What I've drawn here in blue,you could view this kind of the top ridgeof the figure.If you were to take cross sections of the figure,that's what this yellow line is.If you were to take cross sections of this figure,that our vertical, I should sayour perpendicular to the X axis,those cross sections are going to beisosceles right triangles.This cross sectionis going to look like this,if you were going to flatten it out.So over here it's sitting.It's popping out of your page or out of your screen.If you were to actually flatten it out,the cross sections would look like this.It's going to be an isosceles right trianglewith a hypotenuse of the isosceles right trianglesits along the base.Sits along the base.So, it's isosceles. So that's equal to that.It's a right triangle,and then this distancethis distance between that pointand this point is the same as the distancebetween F of X and G of X.F of X and G of X for this X value right over there.Now obviously that changes as we change our X value.To help us visualize this shape here,I've kind of drawn a picture of our coordinate plane.If we've viewed as an angle,if we're kind of above it,you can kind of start to seehow this figure would look.Once again, I've drawn the base.I've drawn the base of it.I've drawn the base of it right over there.Maybe I should to make it clear.Let me get like this.Shade it in kind of parallelto these cross sections.So, I've drawn the base right over there.There's two other sides.There the side that's on ... I've drawn it here.I guess you could view it on its top sideor the left side right over there.Over on this picture that would be this.When we're looking at it from above.Then you have this other side.I guess on this viewthis one you could call kind of the right side.Over here this is kind of the ...when you viewed over here this is the bottom side.The whole reason why I set this up,and we tempting to visualize this figure.I want to see if you can come up with a definiteintegral that describes the volume of this figure.That kind of almost looks like a footballif you cut it in half or a rugby ball.It's skewed a little bit as well.What's an expression a definite integral thatexpresses the volume of this.I encourage you to use the factthat it intersects at the points.These functions intersect at the point zero zeroand (c,d).Can you come up with some expressiona definite in row of terms of zeros,and Cs, and Ds, and Fs, and Gsthat describe the volume of this figure?Assuming you've paused the video,and have had a go at it, let's think about it.If we want to find the volume,one way to think about it iswe could take the volume of,we could approximate the volumeas the volume of these individual triangles.That would be the area of each of these trianglestimes some very small depth.Some very small depth.I'll just shade it in to show the depth.Some very small depth which we could call DX.Once again we could find the volume of each of theseby finding the area,the cross sectional area there,and then multiplying that timesa little DX.A little DX which would give us three,so this is a little DX,which would give us three-dimensional.That's our DX. I could write that a little bit neater.DX to give us a little bit of three-dimensional depth.How could we ... what is the volume ofone of these figures going to look like?Well, if we say, let me just call this height H.We know that H is going to be F of X minus G of X.That's this distance right over here.Let's call that H.We know that H is going to be,maybe I should say H of X.It is going to be a function of X.H of X is going to be F of X.F of X minus G of X. Minus G of X.Given a H, what is going to be the area of this triangle?This is a 45, 45, 90 triangle.This is 90, then this is going to have to be 45 degrees.That's going to have to be 45 degrees.We know that the sides of a 45, 45, 90 triangleor squared of two times the hypotenuse.This is going to be squared of two over twotimes the hypotenuse.Squared two over two time the hypotenuse.You could get that straight from the pythagorean theorem.If the side, let's say it's length A,then this side has length A.You're going to have A squared plus A squaredis equal to the hypotenuse squared,or two A squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.A squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared over two,or that A is equal to H over the squared of two,which is the same thing as a squared of two H over two.I just rationalized the denominator,multiplied by open numerator,and then denominator by squared of two.That's where I got this from.What is the area going to be?The area is just going to be your base timesyour height times one-half.Let me write that down.The areathe area therethe area is just going to be the base,which is squared of two over two times our hypotenuse,times the height which is squared of two over twotime our hypotenuse, times one-half.Times one-half.If we didn't do that one-half,we'd be figuring out the area of this entire square.This is obviously where were concerned withthe triangle.What's this going to be?This is going to be squared of two over twotimes squared of two over two is going to beone-half and then you're going to haveanother one-half.So, it's one-fourth, one-fourth H square.Did I do that right?This is ... yes it's going to be two over four,which is one-half, and then times another one-half.This one-fourth H squared is the area.Now, what's going to be the volumeof each of these triangles?Well the volume of each of these triangles right over here,the volume is just going to be our area times DX.It's just going to be one-fourth H squaredtimes our depth. Times our depth DX.If we just integrated a bunch of these,from our X equals zero all the way to X equals C,we essentially have our volume of the entire figure.So how could we write that?We want to write.We want to essentially to find the volume of the figure.We're kind of in the home stretch here.Actually let me write volume.This is volume of a section.Volume of a cross section.So, what's the volume of the entire thing going to be?The volumevolume of the figureof the figureis going to be the definite integral,the definite integral from X equals zeroto X equals C. X equals zero to C of one-fourth H squared.One-fourth.We know that H is equal to F of X minus G of X.Instead of H, I'm going to writeF of X minus G of X squaredsquared DX.DX and we're done.We just found an expression for,a definite integral expressionI guess you could say,for the volume of this strange figurethat we have defined.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-x-and-y-axes/v/disk-method-around-x-axis	khanacademy	video	:00Over here I've drawn part of the graph of yis equal to x squared.And what we're going to do is use our powersof definite integrals to find volumes instead of just areas.So let's review what we're doing whenwe take just a regular definite integral.So if we take the definite integral between, say,0 and 2 of x squared dx, what does that represent?Well, let's look at our endpoints.So this is x is equal to 0.Let's say that this right over here is x is equal to 2.What we're doing is for each x, we'refinding a little dx around it-- so this right over hereis a little dx.And we're multiplying that dx times our function,times x squared.So what we're doing is we're multiplying this width timesthis height right over here.The height right over here is x squared.And we're getting the area of this little rectangle.And the integral sign is literallythe sum of all of these rectangles for all of the x'sbetween x is equal to 0 and x is equal to 2.But the limit of that as these dx's get smaller and smallerand smaller, get infinitely small,but not being equal to 0.And we have an infinite number of them.That's the whole power of the definite integral.And so you can imagine, as these dx's get smaller and smallerand smaller, these rectangles get narrower and narrowerand narrower, and we have more of them,we are getting a better and better approximationof the area under the curve until, at the limit,we are getting the area under the curve.Now we're going to apply that same idea, notto find the area under this curve,but to find the volume if we wereto rotate this curve around the x-axis.So this is going to stretch our powers of visualization here.So let's think about what happenswhen we rotate this thing around the x-axis.So if we were to rotate it, and I'll look at itand say that we're looking it a little bit from the right.So we get kind of a base that looks something like this.So this is my best attempt to draw it.So you have a base that looks something like that.And then the rest of the function,if we just think about between 0 and 2,it looks like one of those piecesfrom-- I don't know if you ever played the game Sorry--or it looks like a little bit of a weird hat.So it looks like this, and let me shade it in a little bitso it looks something like that.And just so that we're making surewe can visualize this thing that's being rotated.We care about the entire volume of the thing.Let me draw it from a few different angles.So if I drew from the top, it would look something like this.It'll become a little more obviousthat it looks something like a hat.It would point up like this, and it goes down like that.It would look something like that.So in this angle, we're not seeing the bottom of it.And if you were to just orient yourself,the axes, in this case, look like this.So this is the y-axis.And the x-axis goes right inside of this thingand then pops out the other side.And if this thing was transparent,then you could see the back side.It would look something like that.The x-axis, if you could see through it,would pop the base right over there,would go right through the base right over there.And it'd come out on the other side.So this is one orientation for the same thing.You could visualize it from different angles.So let's think about how we can take the volume of it.Well, instead of thinking about the area of eachof these rectangles, what happens if we rotate eachof these rectangles around the x-axis?So let's do it.So let's take each of these.Let's say you have this dx right over here,and you rotate it around the x-axis.So if you were rotate this thing around the x-axis--so I'm trying my best to-- around the x-axis,you rotate it.What do you end up with?Well, you get something that looks kind of like a coin,like a disk, like a quarter of some kind.And let me draw it out here.So that same disk out here would look something like this.And it has a depth of dx.So how can we find the volume of that disk?Let me redraw it out here, too.It's really important to visualize this stuff properly.So this is my x-axis.My disk looks something like this.My best attempt at the x-axis sits it right over there.It comes out of the center.And then this is the surface of my disk.And then this right over here is my depth dx.So that looks pretty good.And then let me just shade it in a little bitto give you a little bit of the depth.So how can we find the volume of this?Well, like any disk or cylinder, you justhave to think about what the area of this faceis and then multiply it times the depth.So what's the area of this base?Well, we know that the area of a circleis equal to pi r squared.So if we know the radius of this face,we can figure out the area of the face.Well, what's the radius?Well, the radius is just the heightof that original rectangle.And for any x, the height over hereis going to be equal to f of x.And in this case, f of x is x squared.So over here, our radius is equal to x squared.So the area of the face for a particular xis going to be equal to pi times f of x squared.In this case, f of x is x squared.Now, what's our volume going to be?Well, our volume is going to be our area times the depth here.It's going to be that times the depth, times dx.So the volume of this thing right over here-- so the volumejust of this coin, I guess you could call it,is going to be equal to.So my volume is going to be equal to my area timesdx, which is equal to pi times x squared squared.So it's equal to pi-- x squared squaredis x to the fourth-- pi x to the fourth dx.Now, this expression right over here,this gave us the volume just of one of those disks.But what we want is the volume of this entire hat,or this entire bugle or cone-looking,or I guess you could say the front-of-a-trumpet-lookingthing.So how could we do that?Well, the exact same technique.What happens if we were to take the sum of all of these things?So let's do that, take the sum of all of these things.And I'll switch to one color-- pi times x to the fourth dx.We're going take the sum of all of these thingsfrom x is equal to 0 to 2.Those are the boundaries that we started off with.I just defined them arbitrarily.We could do this, really, for any two x values--between x is equal to 0 and x equals 2.And we're going to take the sum of the volumes of allof these coins.But the limit-- as the depths get smaller and smallerand smaller and we have more and more and morecoins, at the limit, we're actuallygoing to get the volume of our cone or our bugleor whatever we want to call it.So if we just evaluate this definite integral,we have our volume.So let's see if we can do that.And now this is just taking a standard definite integral.So this is going to be equal to-- and I encourageyou to try it out before I do it.So we can take the pi out.So it's going to be equal to pi times the integralfrom 0 to 2 of x to the fourth dx.I don't like that color.Now, the antiderivative of x to the fourthis x to the fifth over 5.So this is going to be equal to pi times x to the fifth over 5.And we're going to go from 0 to 2.So this is going to be equal to pi times this thingevaluated at 2.Let's see.2 to the third is 8.2 to the fourth is 16.2 to the fifth is-- let me just write it down.2 to the fifth over 5 minus 0 to the fifth over 5.And this is going to be equal to-- 2to the fifth is 32, so it's going to be equal to pi times32/5 minus-- well, this is just 0--minus 0, which is equal to 32 pi over 5.And we're done.We were able to figure out the volumeof this kind of wacky shape.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-x-and-y-axes/v/generalizing-disc-method-around-x-axis	khanacademy	video	":00What we're going to do in this videois generalize what we did in the last video.And, essentially, end up with the formulafor rotating something around the X-axis like this using,what we call, the ""disk method"".And the point is to show you where that formula inside a calculus textbook actually comes from.But it just comes from the same exact principles we did in the last video!It's not advised to memorize the formula; I highly recommend against that because you really need to know what's going on.It's really better to do it in first principles where you findthe volume of each of these disks.But let's just generalize what we saw in the last video.So instead of saying that ""y = x^2"",let's just say that this is the graph, the function that's right over here.Let's just generalize it and call it ""y=f(x)"".And instead of saying x is going from 0 to 2let's say that we're going between a and b, so these are just two endpoints along the X-axis.So how would we find the volume of this?Well, just like the last video, we still take a disk just like this.But what is the height of the disk?The height of the disk is not just x^2 since we've generalized it.So the height is simply going to be whatever the height of the function is at that point.So the height of the disk is going to be f(x)!The area of the space of this disk is going to be πR^2.So our radius is f(x), and we're just going to square it.That's the area, that's the area of this face right over here.What is the volume of the disk?We're just going to multiply that by our depth, which going to be dx.And we want to take the sum of all of these disks from a to b,and we're going to take the sum of them, and we're going to take the limit as the ""dx""s get smaller and smaller.And we have an infinite number of these disks.Thus, we are going to the integral of this from a to b!And this right here is the formula that you will see often in a calculus textbook for using the disk method as you're rotating around the X-axis.So I just wanted to show you that it comes out of the common sense of finding the volume of this disk.The f(x) right over here is just the radius of the disk, so this part over here is really just πR^2;we multiply it [area of the circle] times the depth; then we take the sum from a to b of all of the disks.And essentially since this is integral is the limit of all the disks getting narrower and narrower. And thus, we have an infinite number of these disks."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-x-and-y-axes/v/disc-method-around-y-axis	khanacademy	video	:00Here we have the graph, or part of the graph, of yis equal to x squared again.And I want to find the volume of another solid of revolution.But instead of rotating around the x-axis this time,I want to rotate around the y-axis.And instead of going between 0 and some point,I'm going to go between y is equal to 1 and y is equal to 4.So what I'm going to do is I'm goingto take this graph right over here.I'm going to take this curve.And instead of rotating it around the x-axis, like wedid in the last few videos, I'm goingto rotate it around the y-axis.So I'm going to rotate it around just like that.So what's the shape that we would get?So let me see if we can visualize this.So the base is going to look somethinglike that if we could see through it.And then this up here, the top of it,would look something like that.And we care about the stuff in between.So we care about this part right over here,not the very bottom of it.And let me shade it in a little bit.So it would look something like that.So let me draw it separately, just so we can visualize it.So I'll draw it at different angles.So if I were to draw it with the y-axis kind of coming outthe back, it would look something like this.It would look something like-- it gets a little bit smallerlike that.And then it gets cut off right over here, right over herelike that.So it looks-- I don't know what shape you could call it.But I think hopefully you're conceptualizing this.Let me do it in that same yellow color.The visual-- that's not yellow.The visualization here is probably the hardest part.But as we can see it's not too bad.So it looks something like this.It looks like maybe a truffle, an upside-down truffle.So this right here, let me draw the y-axis justto show how we're oriented.So the y-axis is popping out in this example like that.Then it goes down over here.And then the x-axis is going like this.So I just tilted this over.I tilted it over a little bit to beable to view it at a different angle.This top right over here is this top right over there.So that gives you an idea of what it looks like.But we still haven't thought about how do we actuallyfind the volume of this thing?Well, what we can do, instead of creatingdiscs where the depth is in little dx's, what if we createddiscs where the depth is in dy?So let's think about that a little bit.So let's create-- let's think about constructinga disc at a certain y-value.So let's think about a certain y-value,and we're going to construct a disc right over there thathas the same radius of the shape at that point.So that's our disc.That's our disc right over here.And then it has a depth-- insteadof saying it has a depth of dx, let's say it has a depth of dy.So this depth right over here is dy.So what is the volume of this disc in terms of y?And as you could imagine, we're goingto do this definite integral, and it is a definite integral,with respect to y.So what's the volume of this thing?Well, like we did in the last video,we have to figure out the area of the top of eachof these discs.Or I guess you could say the face of this coin.Well, to find that area it's pi r squared.If we can figure out this radius right over here,we know the area.So what's that radius?So to think about that radius in terms of y,we just have to solve this equation explicitlyin terms of y.So instead of saying it's y is equal to x squared,we can take the principal root of both sides,and we could say that the square root of y is equal to x.And this right over here is only defined for non-negative y's,but that's OK, because we are in the positive x-axis rightover here.So we can also call of this function right over herex is equal to the square root of y.And we're essentially looking at this side of it.We're not looking at this stuff right over here.So we're only looking at this side right over here.We've now expressed this graph, this curve,as x as a function of y.So if we do it that way, what's our radius right over here?Well, our radius right over here is going to be f of y.It's going to be the square root of y.It's going to be the square root of y is our radius.So it's going to be a function of y.I don't want to confuse you if you thought this was f of x,and actually this is f of y.No, it would be a function of y.We could call it g of y.It's going to be the square root of y.So area is equal to pi r squared, whichmeans that the area of this thingis going to be pi times our radius, radius squared.Our radius is square root of y.So this thing is going to be equal to pi--the square root of y squared is just pi times y.Now, if we want the volume, we justhave to multiply the area of this surface times the depth,times dy.So the volume of each of those discsis going to be pi y times dy.This gives you the volume of a disc.Now, if we want the volume of this entire thing,we just have to sum all of these discsfor all of the y-values between y is equal to 1and y is equal to 4.So let's do that.So we just take the definite integral from y is equal to 1and y equals 4.Just as a reminder, definite integralis a very special type of sum.We're summing up all of these things.But we're taking the limit of that sumas these dy's get shorter or get, I guess,squatter and squatter or smaller and smaller,and we have a larger and larger number of these discs.Really, as these become infinitely smalland we have an infinite number of discs,so that our sum doesn't just approximate the volume,it actually is the volume at the limit.So to figure out the volume of this entire thing,we just have to evaluate this definite integralin terms of y.And so how do we do that?What's it going to be equal to?Well, we could take the pi outside.It's going to be pi times the antiderivative of y, whichis just y squared over 2, y squared over 2 evaluatedfrom 1 to 4, which is equal to pi times--well, if you evaluate it at 4, you get 16 over 2.Let me just write it out like this.4 squared over 2 minus 1 squared over 2,which is equal to pi times 16 over 2 is 8, minus 1/2.And so we could view this as 16/2 minus 1/2,which is equal to 15/2.So this is equal to 15/2 times pi.Or another way of thinking of it is 7 and 1/2 times pi.But this is a little bit clearer.So we're done.We found our volume not rotating around the x-axis,but rotating around the y-axis, which is kind of exciting.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/disc-method-rotation-around-horizontal-line	khanacademy	video	:00Here we've graphed the function yis equal to the square root of x.And we're going to create a solid of revolution,but we're not going to do it by rotating thisaround the x or the y-axis.Instead, we're going to rotate itaround another somewhat arbitrary line.And in this case, I will rotate itaround the line y is equal to 1.So let's say that this right over hereis the line y equals 1.So this is what we're going to rotate it around, y equals 1.So the first thing we want to do is visualize what we're doing.And we actually care about the interval.So let's say that the interval is between this pointright over here where the two points intersect.And let's say between that and x is equal to 4.So let's say that this right over here, so this is xequals 4.So it's going to be just right over here.So this is the interval that we're rotating,and we're going to rotate it around y equals 1,not around the x-axis.So what would our figure look like?Well, we're going to rotate it around like this.Going to rotate it around something like this.And so your figure is going to look,I guess you could call it, it will almostlook like a cone head, if you view iton the side, or something like a bullet,but not quite looking like a bullet.But it would be a shape that looks something like that.So hopefully, we can visualize this.We've done this several times already,attempting to visualize these shapes.But let's think about how we could actually figure outthe volume of this solid of revolution.Well, let's just think about it disk by disk.So construct a disk right over here.And we've done this many, many, many times alreadywhere we essentially want the volume of each of these disks.And then we're going to take this for each of these x'sin our interval, and then we're goingto take the sum of the volumes of all the disksto find the volume.We're going to stack them all up,or I guess put them next to each other in this case,and find the volume of our entire figure.So to figure out the volume of each disk,we just have to figure out the area of its face.And I'll do that in purple.We just have to figure out the area of the faceand multiply it by the depth.So what's the area of this face?Well, it's going to be pi times the radius of the face squared.Now, what's the radius of the face here?Well, it's not just square root of x.Square root of x would tell us the distancebetween the x-axis and our function.It's now square root of x minus 1.This length right over here.The square root of x minus 1 for any given x in our interval.So it's going to be equal to square root of-- letme do that same orange color just to make it clearwhere I'm getting it from.It's going to be equal to square root of x minus 1.It's essentially our function minuswhat we are rotating around.That gives us the radius.And so this will give us the area of each of our faces.And then we just multiply that times the depth.The depth, of course, is dx.We've done that multiple times.So times dx.This is the thing that we want to sum up over our interval.And our interval-- let's see, this point right over herewhere the square root of x is equal to 1,that's just going to be x equals 1.This is just x equals 1 over here.And we said that we would do thisall the way until x equals 4.This was kind of our end of our interval.So this is until x is equal to-- let me be careful.This is the x-axis right over here.All the way until x equals 4.So we get confused.This is the x-axis.So we're going from x equals 1 to x equals 4.And we're essentially taking this area, one wayto think about it, between our square root of x and 1,and we're rotating it around 1.So we're using these little disks right over here.So the interval between 1 and 4.And so this is going to give us the volume of our solidof revolution.And so now we just have to evaluatethis definite integral.So let's give a shot at it.So this is going to be equal to the integral from 1 to 4.And we can factor out-- or we could put the pioutside the integral sign.And then we can expand this out.So square root of x squared.Now, what we're going to do is expand this binomial sothe square root of x minus 1 times the square root of xminus 1.Square root of x times square root of x is x.Square root of x times negative 1 is negative square root of x.Negative 1 times square root of xis another negative square root of x.And then negative 1 times negative 1is equal to positive 1.So this part right over here willsimplify to x minus 2 square roots of x.This is minus 2 square roots of x.And then you have plus 1.And then all of that times dx.So this is going to be equal to-- let'sput our pi out there-- the antiderivativeof this business.So that the antiderivative of x is x squared over 2.The antiderivative-- so minus 2 times the antiderivativeof square root of x.Well, square root of x is just x to the 1/2 power,so we increment the power by 1.So it's going to be x to the 3/2 power times 2/3.So times 2/3.Or we could say it's going to be times 2/3x to the 3/2.Let me make it clear.This negative 2 right here is this negative 2.And this expression right over hereis the antiderivative of square root of x.And you could verify this.If you take the derivative of this, 3/2 times 2/3 is 1.Decrement the 3/2, you get x to the 1/2.Now let's take the antiderivative of 1.Well, that's just going to be equal to x.And we're going to evaluate this from 1 to 4.So we're in the home stretch.So this is going to be equal to pi times--well, first let's do it at 4.So you have 4 squared-- I'll write it all out.4 squared over 2 minus-- what's 4 to the 3-- well, let medo this part first.So minus 4/3.I know it's 4 to the 3/2, so 4 to the 1/2 is 2,and then you raise that to the third power, you get 8.So times 8 plus 4.And then you subtract out all of this stuff evaluated at 1.So 1 squared over 2, so that's just going to be minus 1/2.And then we're subtracting this now.Actually, I don't want to skip too many steps.So it's going to be this.This is when we evaluate it at 4.And then we're going to subtract whenwe evaluate this whole thing at 1.So when we evaluate it at 1-- letme do this in this green color.That's not the green color I thought I was going to do.So when you evaluate it at 1, youget 1 squared over 2, which is 1/2.And then you get 1 to the 3/2, which is just 1.So this becomes minus 4/3.And then you have plus 1.And so let's simplify this.And I'll do it all in the same color now.This is going to be equal to pi times-- well,4 squared over 2, that is 16/2, which is equal to 8.And then you have 4 times 8, which is 32, over 3.So minus 32/3, plus 4.And then you have minus 1/2-- we're justdistributing the negative-- plus 4/3, and then you have minus 1.And now we just have to add up a bunch of fractionsto simplify this thing.So what do we get?This is going to be equal to pi times-- let's see,our least common multiple looks like 6.We're going to put everything over a denominator of 6.And so 8 is the same thing as 48/6.32/3 is the same thing as 64/6, so minus 64/6.4 is the same thing as 24/6.1/2 is the same thing as 3/6, so this is negative 3/6,the same thing as negative 1/2.4/3 is the same thing as 8/6.And then negative 1 is the same thing as negative 6/6.A little bit of arithmetic here and let's see what we get.So if we take 48 and we subtract 64 from 48, we get negative 16.Is that right?Yes, we get negative 16.And then if we add 24 to negative 16,you get positive 8.Positive 8 minus 3 is 5.5 plus 8 is 13.13 minus 6 is 7.So this whole numerator simplifies to 7.So we get 7 pi over 6 as our volume.And let me just verify I did that right.So this is going to be negative 16.We get to positive 8, positive 8 plus positive 8 is 16.16 minus 9 is-- yes, it is indeed 7.So we get 7 pi over 6, and we're done.We figured out our volume of this little sidewayscone-looking thing.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/disc-method-rotating-around-vertical-line	khanacademy	video	:00Let's do another example, and this time we'regoing to rotate our function around a vertical line thatis not the y-axis.And if we do that-- so we're goingto rotate y is equal to x squared minus 1--or at least this part of it-- we'regoing to rotate it around the vertical linex is equal to negative 2.And if we do that, we get this gumball shapethat looks something like this.So what I want to do is I want to findthe volume of this using the disc method.So what I want to do is construct some discs.So that's one of the discs right over here.It's going to have some depth, and that depthis going to be dy right over there.And it's going to have some area on top of itthat is a function of any given y that I have.So the volume of a given disc is goingto be the area as a function of ytimes the depth of the disc times dy.And then we just have to integrate it over the intervalthat we care about, and we're doing it all in terms of y.And in this case, we're going to integratefrom y is equal to-- well, this isgoing to hit-- this y-intercept right over hereis y is equal to negative 1.And let's go all the way to y is equal to,let's say y is equal to 3 right over here.So from y equal negative 1 to y equals 3.And that's going to give us the volumeof our upside-down gumdrop-type-looking thing.So the key here, so that we can startevaluating the double integral, is to just figure outwhat the area of each of these discs are as a function of y.And we know that area as a function of yis just going to be pi times radius as a function of ysquared.So the real key is, what is the radius as a function of yfor any one of these y's?So what is the radius as a function of y?So let's think about that a little bit.What is this curve?Well, let's write it as a function of y.If you add 1 to both sides-- and I'm going to swap sides,so you'll get x squared is equal to y plus 1.I just added 1 to both sides and then swapped sides.And you get x is equal to the principal rootof the square root of y plus 1.So this we can write as x-- or we can even write it as f of yif we want-- f of y is equal to the square root of y plus 1.Or we could say x is equal to a function of y, whichis the square root of y plus 1.So what's the distance here at any point?Well, this distance-- let me make it very clear.So it's going to be our total distancein the horizontal direction.So this first part as we're-- and I'm going to do itin a different color so we can see.So this part right over here is justgoing to be the value of the function.It's going to give you an x value.But then you have to add another 2 to go all the way over here.So your entire radius as a function of yis going to be equal to the square root of y plus 1.This essentially will give you one of these x values whenyou're sitting on this curve, this x as a function of y,it'll give you one of these x values.And then from that, you add another 2, so plus 2.Another way of thinking about it, you get an x value here,and from that x value you subtract out xis equal to negative 2.And when you subtract x is equal to negative 2,you're adding 2 here.But hopefully, this makes intuitive sense.This is the x value-- let me do this in a bettercolor-- this right over here, this distance right over here,is the x value you get when you justevaluate the function of y.But then if you wanted the full radius,you have to go another 2 to go to the centerof our axis of rotation.Once again, if you just take a given y right over there,you evaluate the y, you get an x value.That x value will just give you this distance.If you want the full distance, you have to subtract negative 2from that x value, which is essentiallythe same thing as adding 2 to get our full radius.So our radius as a function of y is this thing right over here.So substituting back into this, wecan now write our definite integral for our volume.The volume is going to be equal to the definite integralfrom negative 1 to 3 of pi times our radius squared dy.So I can write the pi out here-- we'vedone this multiple times-- times radius squared--so it's going to be square root of y plus 1 plus 2 squared--that's our radius-- times dy.So we've set up the definite integral.And now we just have to evaluate this thing.And I'll save that for the next video.And I encourage you to try this out on your own.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-disc-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/calculating-integral-disc-method-around-vertical-line	khanacademy	video	:00In the last video, we had set up the definite integralto evaluate the volume of this upside-down gumdroptruffle-looking thing.So now in this video, we can actuallyevaluate the definite integral.So what we need to do is really justexpand out this expression, this square root of y plus 1 plus 2.So let's do that.So this is going to be equal to pi times the definite integralfrom y is equal to negative 1 to y is equal to 3.If you expand this out, you get square root of yplus 1 squared, which is just going to be y plus 1.And then you're going to have 2 times the product of bothof these terms.2 times 2 times square root of y plus 1is going to be plus 4 times the square root of y plus 1.And then you have 2 squared, so plus 4.So you have this whole thing times dy.We can simplify a little bit.You have a 1 plus a 4.We can add the 1 to the 4 and get a 5.And now we're ready to take the antiderivative.So this is going to be equal to pi times-- let'stake the antiderivative of all of this business-- pi times--and I'll color code it.The antiderivative of y is just y squared over 2.The antiderivative of 4 times the square rootof y plus 1-- you just really haveto think of it as 4 times y plus 1 to the 1/2 power.We could use u substitution explicitly,but you probably are pretty practiced in thisand can do this in your head.You have y plus 1 raised to the 1/2 power.Derivative of y plus 1 is just 1,which is essentially out here.So if you did u substitution, youwould say u is equal to y plus 1.But this antiderivative is going to be equal to-- well,if you increment this exponent, youget 3/2 multiplied by the reciprocal 2/3.2/3 times 4 is 8/3.So it's plus 8/3 times y plus 1 to the 3/2.And you can verify.If you take the derivative here youwill get this expression right over here.3/2 times 8/3 is 4.Decremented, you have y plus 1 to the 1/2 power.And then finally, you have-- let's see.What color have I not used yet?Finally, you have this 5.The antiderivative of 5 is just 5y.And we are going to evaluate it at 3 and at negative 1,y equals 3 and y equals negative 1.So this is going to be equal to pi.So let's evaluate all this business at 3.So 3 squared over 2 is 9/2.3 plus 1 is 4 to the 3/2.Well, that's-- so let's see.If square root of 4 is 2 to the third power is 8, 8 times 8/3is 64/3, so plus 64/3.You have 5 times 3.Well, that's going to be 15-- plus 15.And from that, we're going to subtractall this business evaluated at negative 1.So you have negative 1 squared over 2.Well, that's just 1/2.Negative 1 plus 1 is 0 to the 3/2 power.That's going to be 0 times 8/3.This is all going to be 0, so we don't have to even write it.And then finally, you have negative 1 times 5.Well, that's just going to be negative 5.And we are in the home stretch.We really just have to do a little bit of arithmetic,add some hairy fractions right over here.So let's do it.So this whole thing is going to simplify to pi times--and it looks like-- let's see.Our least common multiple of all of these denominatorsis going to be 6.So let's put everything over a denominator of 6.So 9/2 is the same thing as 27/6.64/3 is the same thing as 128/6.15 is the same thing as 90/6.1/2 is the same thing as 3/6.So you would distribute the negative sign.So this is negative 3/6.And negative times negative is positive.5 is the same thing as 30/6, so plus 30/6.And so this is going to give us-- our denominatoris going to be over 6.We're going to multiply something times pi.We have this pi over here.And then we just have to figure out what the numerator is.So let's see if I can do this in my head.So 27 plus 128 is going to be-- let me see.That's going to be 140, 155?Is that right?155?Let's see, if we get to 48 plus another 7-- yeah, 155.Plus 90 gets us to 245.Is that right?Yeah.Plus 90 gets us to 245.Minus 3, you subtract 3 from that, you get to 242.And then you add 30 to that, you get to 272.So we're left with 272 pi/6.But then we can-- let's see.272 and 6 are both divisible by 2.So this is equal to-- let's see.272 divided by 2 is going to be 136 pi over--and if you divide this denominator right over hereby 2-- over 3.Is that right?Yeah.136 pi/3.And 136 is not divisible by 3.So we have it as simplified as we can.This right over here is the volumeof our little upside-down gumdrop-looking thing.

do some more volumes of solids of revolutions.So let's say that I have the graphy is equal to square root of x.So let's do it, so it looks something like this.So that right over there is y is equal to the square root of x.And let's say I also have the graph of y equals x.So let's say y equals x looks something like this.It looks just like that.y equals x.And what I care about now is the solidI get if I were to rotate the area between these two thingsaround to the x-axis.So let's try to visualize it.So the outside is going to be kind of a truffle shape,it's going to look like a truffle shape.And then we hollow out a cone inside of it.So I'll make my best attempt to draw this shape.So it's going to look something like-- so the outside isgoing to look something like this.It's going to look something like that.And we care about the interval.We care about the interval between the pointsthat they intersect.So between this point and this point here.So the outside is going to look something like this.So this is the base of the truffle.That is the base of the truffle, it'sgoing to have this kind of truffle shape on the outside.But I guess maybe we're on some type of a diet,we don't want to eat to the entire truffle.So we carve out a cone on the inside.So the inside of it is essentiallyhollow except for this kind of shell part.So we carve out a cone in the center.So we rotate it around to the x-axis.Truffle on the outside, carved out a cone on the inside.So what's going to be the volume of that thing?So it's essentially, if we take a slice of our figure,it's going to be, this is going to be the wall.And we're essentially going to takethe volume of this entire wall that we'rerotating around the x-axis.So how do we do that?Well, it might dawn on you that if wefound the volume of the truffle if it was notcarved out, and then subtract from that the volumeof the cone, we would essentiallyfind out the volume of the space in between the outsideof the truffle and the cone part of the truffle.So how would we do that?Well, so to find the volume of the outer shape.So let me draw it over here.So actually let me just draw it over here.If we think about the volume of the outer shape,once again, we can use the disk method.So at any given point in time our radius for one of our disksis going to be equal to the function.Let's rotate that disk around.Actually let me do it in a different color,it's hard to see that disk because it'sin the same magenta.So this is a radius, and let's rotate it around.So I'm rotating the disk around.This is our face of the disk, that's our face of the disk.It's going to have a depth of dx.We've seen this multiple times.It's going to have a depth of dx.So the volume of this disk is goingto be our depth, dx, times the area of the face.The area of the face is going to be pi times the radius squared.The radius is going to be equal to the valueof the outer function, in this case the square root of x.So it's going to be pi times our radius squared,which is pi times the square root of x squared.And so if we want to find the volumeof the entire outer thimble, or truffle,or whatever we want to call it.Before we even carve out the center,we just take a sum of a bunch of these, a bunch of these disksthat we've created.So that's one disk, we would have another disk over here.Another disk over here.For each x we have another disk.And as we go, as x's get larger and larger,the disks have a larger and larger radius.So we're going to sum up all of those disks.And we're going to take the limit as each of those disksget infinitely thin, and we have an infinite number of them.But we have to figure out our boundaries of integration.So what are our boundaries of integration?What are the two points right over here where they intersect?Well we could just set these two thingsto be equal to each other.If you just said x is equal to square root of x,when does x equal the square root of x?I mean you can square both sides of this.You could say when does x squared equal x?You could, well we could keep it there.You could kind of solve this, there'smultiple ways you could do it.But you could solve this kind of just thinking about it.If x is equal to 0, x squared is equal to x.And you see that on the graph right over here. xis equal to 0.And also 1 squared is equal to 1.1 is equal to the square root of 1.You could have done other things.You could say OK, x squared minus x is equal to 0.You could factor out an x.You get x times x minus 1 is equal to 0.And so either one of these could be equal to 0,so x is equal to 0 or x minus 1 is equal to 0.And then you get x equals 0 or x is equal to 1.Which gives us our boundaries of integration.So this goes from x equals 0 to x equals 1.And so for the outside of our shapewe can now figure out the volume.But we're not done.We also need to figure out the volumeof the inside of our shape that we're going to take out.So we're going to subtract out that volume.So we're going to subtract out of volume.Our x values, once again, are going between 0 and 1.And so let's think about those disks.So let's think about, let's construct a diskon the inside, right over here.So if I construct a disk on the inside.So now I'm carving out the cone part of it.What is the area of the face of one of those disks?Well it's going to be pi times the radius squared.In this case, the radius is goingto be equal to the value of this inner function, whichis just x.And so this is just y is equal to x.And then we're going to multiply it times the depth,times the depth of each of these disks.And each of these disks are going to have a depth of dx.If you imagine a quarter that has an infinitely-thin depthright over here.So it's going to be dx.And so the volume our, kind of our truffle with a cone carvedout, is going to be this integralminus this integral right over here.And we could evaluate it just like that.Or we could even say, OK we could factor outa pi out of both of them.There are actually, there's multiple waysthat we could write it.But let's just evaluate it like this,and then I'll generalize it in the next video.So this is going to be equal to the definite integral from 0to 1.You take the pi outside.Square root of x squared is goingto be x dx minus the integral, we can factor the pi out.From 0 to 1 of x squared dx.And we could say this is going to beequal to pi times the antiderivative of x, whichis just x squared over 2 evaluated from 0 to 1,minus pi, times the antiderivative of x squared,which is x to the third over 3 evaluated from 0 to 1.This expression is equal to-- and I'mgoing to arbitrarily switch colorsjust because the green's getting monotonous-- pi times 1 squaredover 2 minus 0 squared over 2.I could write squared.1 squared over 2 minus 0 squared over 2, minus pi times 1to the third over 3 minus 0 to the third over 3.And so we get, this is equal to-- letme do it in that same blue color--so this is this simplified.This is just 0 right over here.This is 1 squared over 2, which is just 1/2.So it's just pi over 2, 1/2 times pi minus-- well thisis just 0, this is 1/3, minus pi over 3.And then to simplify this, it's justreally subtracting fractions.So we can find a common denominator.Common denominator is 6.This is going to be 3 pi over 6.This is 3 pi over 6 minus 2 pi over 6.pi over 3 is 2 pi over 6, pi over 2 is 3 pi over 6.And we end up with, we end up with 3 of somethingminus 2 of something, you end up with 1 of something.We end up with 1 pi over 6.And we are done.We were able to find the volume of that wacky kindof gutted-out truffle.

generalize what we did in the last video.So if this is my y-axis and this is-- that's not that straight.This right over here is my x-axis.And let's say I have two functions.So I'm just going to say it in general terms.So let's say I have a function right over here.So let's say it looks something like this.So that's one function.So this is y is equal to f of x.And then I have another function that y is equal to g of x.So let's say it looks something like this.So the blue one right over here is y is equal to g of x.And like we did in the last video,I want to think about the volume of the solid of revolutionwe will get if we essentially rotatethe area between these two, and if wewere to rotate it around the x-axis.So we're saying in very general terms.This could be anything, But.In the way we've draw it now, it would literallybe that same truffle shape.It would be a very similar truffle shape,where on the outside it looks like a truffle.On the outside, it looks something like a truffle,and on the inside, we have carved out a cone.Obviously, this visualization is very specific to the wayI've drawn these functions, but whatwe want to do is generalize at least the mathematics of it.So how do we find a volume?Well, we could think of disks.But instead of thinking of disks,we're going to think about washers now,which is essentially the exact same thing wedid in the last video mathematically,but it's a slightly different way of conceptualizing it.So imagine taking a little chunk between these two functions,just like that.What is going to be the width of this chunk?Well, it's going to be equal to dx.And let's rotate that whole thing around the x-axis.So if we rotate this thing around the x-axis,we end up with a washer.That's why we're going to call this the washer method.And it's really just kind of the disk method,where you're gutting out the inside of a disk.So that's the inside of our washer.And then this is the outside of our washer.Outside of our washer looks something like that.Hopefully, that makes sense.And so the surface of our washer looks something like that.I know I could have drawn this a little bit better,but hopefully it serves the purposeso that we understand it.So the surface of our washer looks something like that.And it has depth of dx.So let me see how well I can draw this.So depth dx.That's the side of this washer.So a washer, you can imagine, is kind of a gutted out coin.So how do we find the volume?Well once again, if we know the surface,if we know the area of the face of this washer,we can just multiply that times the depth.So it's going to be the area of the face of the washer.So the area of the face of the washer--well, it could be the area if it wasn't gutted out.And what would that area be?Well, it would be pi times the overall,the outside radius squared.It would be pi times the outside radius squared.Well, what's the outside radius?The radius that goes to the outside of the washer?Well, that's f of x.So it's going to be f of x is the radius.And we're just going to square that.So this expression right over herewould give us the area of the entire faceif it wasn't a washer, if it was a coin.But now we have to subtract out the inside.So what's the area of the inside?This part right over here?Well, we're going to subtract it out.It's going to be pi times the radius of the inside squared.Well, what's the radius of the inside squared?Well, the inside, in this case, is g of x.It's going to be pi times g of x squared.That's the inner function, at least over the intervalthat we care about.So the area of this washer, we could just leave it like this,or we could factor out a pi.We could say the area is equal to-- if we factor outa pi-- pi times f of x squared minus g of x squared.I don't really have to write a parentheses there.So we could write f of x squared minus g of x squared.And then if we want the volume-- put that in the same yellow.If we want the volume of this thing,we just multiply it times the depth of each of those washers.So the volume of each of these washersare going to be pi times f of x squared minus g of x squared.The outer function squared over our interval,minus our inner function squared over the interval,and then times our depth.That'd be the volume of each of these washers.And that's going to be defined at a given x in our interval,but for each x at these interval,we can define a new washer.So there could be a washer out here, and a washer out here.And so we're going to take the sum of all those washers,and take the limit as we have smaller and smaller depths.And we have an infinite number of infinitely thin washers.So we're going take the integral over our interval from wherethese two things intersect, the interval that we care about.It doesn't have to be where they intersect, but in this case,that's what we'll do.So let's say x equals a to x equals b.Although this could have been a, that could have been b.But this is our interval we're saying in general terms,from a to b.And this will give our volume.This right over here is the volume of each washer.And then we're summing up all of the washersand taking the limit, as we have an infinite number of them.So let's see if we apply this to the example in the last videowhether we get the exact same answer.Well, in the last video, y equalsg of x was equal to x, and y is equal to fof x was equal to the square root of x.So let's evaluate that given what we justwere able to derive.So our volume-- do it up here.The volume is going to be the integral-- whatare the two intersection points?Well, over here, once again, we couldhave defined the interval someplace else,like between there and there.And we would have gotten a different shape.But the points that we care about the way we visualizeit is between x is equal to 0 and x is equal to 1.That's where these two things intersect.We saw that in the last video.Of pi times-- what's f of x squared? f of x squared,square root of x squared is just x, minus g of x squared.g of x is x, that squared is x squared.And then we multiply times dx.So this is going to be equal to-- we can factor out the pi.0 to 1, x minus x squared dx, which is equal to pi times--let's see, the antiderivative of x is x squared over 2.The antiderivative of x squared is x squared over 3-- sorry, xto the third over 3.And we're going to evaluate this from 0 to 1.So this is going to be equal to-- I'm running outof my real estate a little bit.Let me scroll over to the right a little bit.So this is going to be equal to pi times-- well,when you evaluate this whole thing at 1,you get-- let's see, you get 1/2 minus 1/3.And then you subtract it, evaluate it at 0,but that's just going to be 0.0 squared over 2 minus 0, 0 to the third power.That's just all going to be 0.So when you subtract out 0, you'rejust left with this expression right over here.What's 1/2 minus 1/3?Well, that's 1/6.This is 1/6.And so we're left with this is equal to pi over 6,which is the exact same thing that we got in the last video.And that's because we did the exact same thingthat we did in the last video.We just conceptualized it a little bit differently.We generalized it in terms of f of x and g of x.And we essentially conceptualized it as a washer,as opposed to doing the disk method for an outer shapeand an inner shape like we did in the last video.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-washer-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/washer-method-rotating-around-non-axis	khanacademy	video	":00Now let's do a really interesting problem.So I have y equals x, and y is equal to xsquared minus 2x right over here.And we're going to rotate the regionin between these two functions.So that's this region right over here.And we're not going to rotate it just around the x-axis,we're going to rotate it around the horizontal line y equals 4.So we're going to rotate it around this.And if we do that, we'll get a shape that looks like this.I drew it ahead of time, just so I could draw it nicely.And as you can see, it looks like some type of a vasewith a hole at the bottom.And so what we're going to do is attempt to do this using,I guess you'd call it the washer method whichis a variant of the disk method.So let's construct a washer.So let's look at a given x.So let's say an x right over here.So let's say that we're at an x right over there.And what we're going to do is we'regoing to rotate this region.We're going to give it some depth, dx.So that is dx.We're going to rotate this around the line yis equal to 4.So if you were to visualize it over here, you have some depth.And when you rotate it around, the inner radiusis going to look like the inner radius of our washer.It's going to look something like that.And then the outer radius of our washeris going to contour around x squared minus 2x.So it's going to look something--my best attempt to draw it-- it'sgoing to look something like that.And of course, our washer is going to have some depth.So let me draw the depth.So it's going to have some depth, dx.So this is my best attempt at drawing some of that the depth.So this is the depth of our washer.And then just to make the face of the washer a little bitclearer, let me do it in this green color.So the face of the washer is goingto be all of this business.All of this business is going to be the face of our washer.So if we can figure out the volume of oneof these washers for a given x, then we justhave to sum up all of the washers for allof the x's in our interval.So let's see if we can set up the integral,and maybe in the next video we'lljust forge ahead and actually evaluate the integral.So let's think about the volume of the washer.To think about the volume of the washer,we really just have to think about the areaof the face of the washer.So area of ""face""-- put face in quotes--is going to be equal to what?Well, it would be the area of the washer--if it wasn't a washer, if it was just a coin--and then subtract out the area of the partthat you're cutting out.So the area of the washer if it didn'thave a hole in the middle would justbe pi times the outer radius squared.It would be pi times this radius squared,that we could call the outer radius.And since it's a washer, we need to subtract outthe area of this inner circle.So minus pi times inner radius squared.So we really just have to figure outwhat the outer and inner radius, or radii I should say, are.So let's think about it.So our outer radius is going to be equal to what?Well, we can visualize it over here.This is our outer radius, which is alsogoing to be equal to that right over there.So that's the distance between y equals4 and the function that's defining our outside.So this is essentially, this height right over here,is going to be equal to 4 minus x squared minus 2x.I'm just finding the distance or the height between these twofunctions.So the outer radius is going to be 4 minus this,minus x squared minus 2x, which is just 4minus x squared plus 2x.Now, what is the inner radius?What is that going to be?Well, that's just going to be this distance between yequals 4 and y equals x.So it's just going to be 4 minus x.So if we wanted to find the area of the face of oneof these washers for a given x, it's going to be--and we can factor out this pi-- it'sgoing to be pi times the outer radius squared,which is all of this business squared.So it's going to be 4 minus x squared plus 2x squaredminus pi times the inner radius--although we factored out the pi-- sominus the inner radius squared.So minus 4 minus x squared.So this will give us the area of the surfaceor the face of one of these washers.If we want the volume of one of those watchers,we then just have to multiply times the depth, dx.And then if we want to actually find the volume of this entirefigure, then we just have to sum up all of these washersfor each of our x's.So let's do that.So we're going to sum up the washers for eachof our x's and take the limit as they approach zero,but we have to make sure we got our interval right.So what are these-- we care about the entire regionbetween the points where they intersect.So let's make sure we get our interval.So to figure out our interval, we justsay when does y equal x intersect y equalx squared minus 2x?Let me do this in a different color.We just have to think about when doesx equal x squared minus 2x.When are our two functions equal to each other?Which is equivalent to-- if we justsubtract x from both sides, we getwhen does x squared minus 3x equal 0.We can factor out an x on the right hand side.So this is going to be when does x times x minus 3 equal zero.Well, if the product is equal to 0, at least one of theseneed to be equal to 0.So x could be equal to 0, or x minus 3 is equal to 0.So x is equal to 0 or x is equal to 3.So this is x is 0, and this right over hereis x is equal to 3.So that gives us our interval.We're going to go from x equals 0to x equals 3 to get our volume.In the next video, we'll actuallyevaluate this integral."
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-washer-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/part-2-of-washer-for-not-axis-rotation	khanacademy	video	:00Where we left off in the last video,we'd actually set up our definite integralto figure out the volume of this figure.So now we just have to evaluate it.And really the hardest part is goingto be simplifying that and that right over there.So let's get to it.So what is this thing squared?Well, looks like we're going to haveto do a little bit of polynomial multiplication here.So I'll go into that same color I had.So we're going to have 4 minus x squared plus 2x times 4 minus--actually, let me write that in the order of the terms,or the degree of the terms.It's negative x squared plus 2x plus 4-- Ijust switched the order of these things-- times negative xsquared plus 2x plus 4.So we're just going to multiply these two things.I shouldn't even write a multiplication symbol,it looks too much like an x.So 4 times 4 is 16.4 times 2x is 8x.4 times negative x squared is negative 4x squared.2x times 4 is 8x.2x times 2x is 4x squared.And then 2x times negative x squaredis negative 2x to the third power.And now we just have to multiply negative x times all this.So negative-- or negative x squared.Negative x squared times 4 is negative 4x squared.Negative x squared times 2x is negative 2x to the third power.And then negative x squared timesnegative x squared is positive x to the fourth.So it's going to be positive x to the fourth.And now we just have to add up all of these terms.And we get, let's see, we get x to the fourth--add these two-- minus 4x to the third.And then this cancels with this, but we stillhave that, so minus 4x squared.You add these two right over here, you get plus 16x.And then you have plus 16.So that's this expanded out.And now if we want to-- 4 minus x times 4 minus x.So if we just have 4 minus x times 4 minus x,we could actually do it this way as well.But that's just going to be 4 times 4, whichis 16, plus 4 times negative x, which is negative 4x,negative x times 4, another negative 4x,and then negative x times negative x is equal toplus x squared.So if we were to swap the order, weget x squared minus 8x plus 16.But we're going to subtract this.So if you have the negative sign out there,we're going to subtract this business.So let's just do it right over heresince we already have it set up.So we have this minus this.We're going to subtract this, or wecould add the negative of it.So we'll put negative x squared plus 8x minus 16.So I'm just going to add the negative of this.And we get-- and I'll do this in a new color--let's see, we get x to the fourth minus 4xto the third power minus 5x squared plus 24x,and then these cancel out.So that's what we are left with.And so that's the inside of our integral.So we're going to take the integral of this thing,just so I don't have to keep rewriting this thing,from 0 until, if I remember correctly, 3.Yup, from 0 to 3, of this, dx.And then we had a pi out front here.So I'll just take that out of the integral.So times pi.Well, now we just to take the antiderivative.And this is going to be equal to pi times antiderivativeof x to the fourth is x to the fifth over 5.Antiderivative of 4x to the thirdis actually x to the fourth.So this is going to be minus x to the fourth--you can verify that.Derivative is 4x, and then you decrementthe exponent, 4x to the third.So that works out.And then the antiderivative of this is negative 5/3 xto the third.Just incremented the exponent and divided by that.And then you have plus 24x squared over 2, or 12x squared.And we're going to evaluate that.I like to match colors for my opening and closingparentheses.We're going to evaluate that-- actually,let me do it as brackets.We're going to evaluate that from 0 to 3.So this is going to be equal to pi times-- let'sevaluate all this business at 3.So we're going to get 3 to the fifth power.So let's see, 3 to the third is equal to 27.3 to the fourth is equal to 81.3 to the fifth is going to be equal to-- this times 3 is 243.So it's going to be 243-- it's goingto be some hairy math-- 243 over 5 minus-- well, 3 to the fourthis 81.Minus 81.Minus, let's see, we're going to have 3 to the third times--let's see, so it's going to be minus 5 over 3times 3 to the third power.So times 27.Well, 27 divided by 3 is just 9.9 times 5 is 45.So let's just simplify that.So this is going to be equal to 45.Did I do that right?Yeah.It's essentially going to be like 3 squared times 5,because you're dividing by 3 here.So it's going to have 45.And then finally, 3 squared is 9.9 times 12 is 108.So plus 108.These problems that involve hairy arithmeticare always the most stressful for me,but I'll try not to get too stressed.And then we're going to subtract out this whole thing evaluatedat 0, but lucky for us, that's pretty simple.This evaluated is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.So we're going to subtract out 0,which simplifies things a good bit.So now we just have to do some hairy fraction arithmetic.So let's do it.So what I'm going to do first is simplify all of this part.And then I'm going to worry about putting itover a denominator of 5.So let's see what we have.We have negative 81 minus 45.So these two right over here become negative 126.And then negative 126 plus 108.Well, that's just going to be the same thing as negative 26plus 8, which is going to be negative 18.So this whole thing simplifies to negative 18.Did I do that right?So this is negative 126.And then negative 126-- yes.It will be negative 18.So now we just have to write negative 18 over 5.Negative 18 over 5 is the same thing as negative-- let's see,5 times 10 is 50, plus 40.So that's going to be negative 90 over 5.So this whole thing has simplifiedto-- is equal to pi times 243 over 5 minus 90over 5, which is equal to pi-- guys,I deserve a drum roll now.This was some hairy mathematics.So 243 minus 90 is going to be 153 over 5.Or we can write this as 153 pi over 5.And after all that math, you sometimesforget what we were doing in the first place.We were figuring out this right over hereis the volume of this figure thathad this little inside of it bored out.
https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-applications-of-integrals/cs1-volume-washer-method-revolving-around-other-axes/v/washer-or-ring-method-for-vertical-line-rotation	khanacademy	video	:00What we're going to do in this video istake the region between the two curves,y is equal to square root of x on top and yis equal to x squared on the bottomand rotate it around a vertical line that is not the y-axis.So we're going to rotate it around the vertical line xis equal to 2.We're going to rotate it right around like that.And if we rotate it like that, wewill get this shape, so this strange-looking shape.It's hollowed out in the middle.You can kind of use the y equals x squared part kind of hollowsout the middle.And it's really the stuff in betweenthat forms the wall of this rotated shape.So let's think about how we can figure out the volume.And we're going to do it using the disk method, sometimescalled the ring method-- actually,it's going to be more of the washer method--to do this one right over here.So we're rotating around a vertical line.We want to use our disk or ring or washer method.And so it'll be really helpful to havea bunch of rings stacked up in the y direction.So we're probably going to want to integrate with respect to y.Let me make it clear what I'm talking about.Each of our rings are going to look something like this.So let me do my best attempt to draw.So that's the inner radius of the ring definedby y is equal to x squared.And then the outside radius of the ringmight look something like this.My best attempt to draw it reasonably.The outside radius of the ring might look something like that.And the depth of the ring would be a little dy just like that.So let me draw the depth.So let me see, right over here.You could kind of view it as the height of the ring,because we are thinking in a vertical direction.And that would be a ring for a giveny for, say, this y right over here.It's essentially the ring generatedif you were to take this rectangle of height dyand rotate it around the line x equals 2.And we're going to construct a ringlike that for each of the y's in our interval.So you could imagine stacking up a whole set of rings justlike this and then taking the sum of the volumes of allof those rings and the limit of that sideas you have an infinite number of rings with-- or closeto infinite-- or really, infinitenumber of rings with infinitesmally small heightor depth or dy.So let's figure out how we would do this.Well, we know that all we have to dois figure out what the volume of one of these ringsare for given y as a function of yand then integrate along all of them, sum them all up.So let's figure out what the volume of one of these ringsare.And to do it, we're going to expressthese functions as functions of y.So our purple function, y is equal to square root of x,if we square both sides, we would get y squaredis equal to x.And let me swap the sides so it makes it clear that now xis a function of y.x is equal to y squared.That's our top function the way we'vedrawn a kind of outer shell for our figure.And then y is equal to x squared.If you take the principal root of both sides of that and itall works out because we're operating in the first quadranthere.That's the part of it that we care about.So you're going to get x is equal to the square root of y.That is our yellow function right over there.Now, how do we figure out the areaof the surface of one of these rings or one of these washers?Well, the area-- let me do this in orangebecause I drew that ring in orange.So the area of the surface right over herein orange as a function of y is goingto be equal to the area of the circleif I just consider the outer radius,and then I subtract out the area of the circle constructedby the inner radius, just kind of subtract it out.So the outer-circle radius, so it'sgoing to be pi times outer radius squared minus pi-- letme write it this way-- outer-- well,I'll just write it-- outer radius--this is going to be as a function of y-- outer radiussquared minus pi times inner radius squared.And we want this all to be a function of y.So the outer radius as a function of yis going to be what?Well, it might be easier to visualize-- actually,I'll try it both places.So it's this entire distance right over here,essentially, the distance between the vertical line,the horizontal distance between our vertical line,and our outer function.So if you think about it in terms of x,It's going to be 2 minus whateverthe x value is right over here.So the x value right over here is going to be y squared.Remember, we want this is a function of y.So our outer radius, this whole distance,is going to be 2 minus the x value here as a function of y.That x value is y squared.So the outer radius is 2 minus x-- sorry.2 minus y squared.We want it as a function of y.And then our inner radius is going to be equal to what?Well, that's going to be the difference,the horizontal distance, between this vertical lineand our inner function, our inner boundary.So it's going to be the horizontal distance between twoand whatever x value this is.But this x value as a function of y is just square root of y.So it's going to be 2 minus square root of y.And so now, we can come up with an expression for area.It's going to be-- and I'll just factor out-- actually,I'll leave the pi there.So it's going to be pi-- right over here--it's going to be pi times outer radius squared.Well, the outer radius is 2 minus ysquared-- and let me just-- well, I'll just write it.2 minus y squared-- and we're goingto square that-- squared, minus pi times the inner radiussquared.Well, we already figured that out.The inner radius is 2 minus square root of y.And we're going to square that one, too.So this gives us the area of one of our ringsas a function of y, the top of the ring, whereI shaded in orange.And now, if we want the volume of one of those rings,we have to multiply it by its depth or its height the waywe've drawn it right over here.And its height-- we've done this multiple times already rightover here-- is an infinitesimal change in y.So we're going to multiply all that business times dy.This is the volume of one of our rings.And then we want to sum up all of the rings over our interval.So we're going to sum up all of the rings over the interval.And when you take the integral sign,it's a sum where you're taking the limit as youhave an infinite number of rings that become infinitesimallysmall in height or depth, depending on how you view it.And what's our interval?So we've looked at this multiple times.These two graphs-- you could do it by inspection.You could try to solve it in some way,but it's pretty obvious that they intersect at--remember we care about our y interval.They intersect at y is equal to 0 and y is equal to 1.And there you have it.We've set up our integral for the volumeof this shape right over here.I'll leave you there, and in this next video,we will just evaluate this integral.

Thing is, though, there’s some subtlely to this topic, and some potential for paradoxes if you’re not careful, so the secondary goal is that you have some appreciation for what those paradoxes are and how to avoid them. You see, it’s common for people to say that the derivative measures “instantaneous rate of change”, but if you think about it, that phrase is actually an oxymoron: Change is something that happens between separate points in time, and when you blind yourself to all but a single instant, there is no more room for change. You’ll see what I mean as we get into it, and when you appreciate that a phrase like “instantaneous rate of change” is nonsensical, it makes you appreciate how clever the fathers of calculus were in capturing the idea this phrase is meant to evoke with a perfectly sensible piece of math: The derivative. As our central example, imagine a car that starts at some point A, speeds up, then slows to a stop at some point B 100 meters away, all over the course of 10 seconds. This is the setup I want you to keep in mind while I lay out what exactly a derivative is. We could graph this motion, letting a vertical axis represent the distance traveled, and a horizontal axis represent time. At each time t, represented with a point on the horizontal axis, the height of the graph tells us how far the car has traveled after that amount of time. It’s common to name a distance function like this s(t). I’d use the letter d for distance, except that it already has another full time job in calculus. Initially this curve is quite shallow, since the car is slow at the start. During the first second, the distance traveled by the car hardly changes at all. For the next few seconds, as the car speeds up, the distance traveled in a given second gets larger, corresponding to a steeper slope in the graph. And as it slows towards the end, the curve shallows out again. If we were to plot the car’s velocity in meters per second as a function of time, it might look like this bump. At time t=0, the velocity is 0. Up to the middle of the journey, the car builds up to some maximum velocity, covering a relatively large distance in each second. Then it slows back down to a speed of 0 meters per second. These two curves are highly related to each other; if you change the specific distance vs. time function, you’ll have some different velocity vs. time function. We want to understand the specifics of this relationship. Exactly how does velocity depend on this distance vs. time function. It’s worth taking a moment to think critically about what velocity actually means here. Intuitively, we all know what velocity at a given moment means, it’s whatever the car’s speedometer shows in that moment. And intuitively, it might make sense that velocity should be higher at times when the distance function is steeper; when the car traverses more distance per unit time. But the funny thing is, velocity at a single moment makes no sense. If I show you a picture of a car, a snapshot in an instant, and ask you how fast it’s going, you’d have no way of telling me. What you need are two points in time to compare, perhaps comparing the distance traveled after 4 seconds to the distance traveled after 5 second. That way, you can take the change in distance over the change in time. Right? That’s what velocity is, the distance traveled over a given amount of time. So how is it that we’re looking at a function for velocity that only takes in a single value for t, a single snapshot in time. It’s weird, isn’t it? We want to associate each individual point in time with a velocity, but computing velocity requires comparing two points in time. If that feels strange and paradoxical, good! You’re grappling with the same conflict that the fathers of calculus did, and if you want a deep understanding of rates of change, not just for a moving car, but for all sorts of scenarios in science, you’ll need a resolution to this apparent paradox. First let’s talk about the real world, then we’ll go into a purely mathematical one. Think about what an actual car’s speedometer might be doing. At some point, say 3 seconds into the journey, the speedometer might measure how far the car goes in a very small amount of time, perhaps the distance traveled between 3 seconds and 3.01 seconds. Then it would compute the speed in meters per second as that tiny distance, in meters, divided by that tiny time, 0.01 seconds. That is, a physical car can sidestep the paradox by not actually computing speed at a single point in time, and instead computing speed during very small amounts of time. Let’s call that difference in time “dt”, which you might think of as 0.01 seconds, and call the resulting difference in distance traveled “ds”. So the velocity at that point in time is ds over dt, the tiny change in distance over the tiny change in time. Graphically, imagine zooming in on the point of the distance vs. time graph above t=3. That dt is a small step to the right, since time is on the horizontal axis, and that ds is the resulting change in the height of the graph, since the vertical axis represents distance traveled. So ds/dt is the rise-over-run slope between two very close points on the graph. Of course, there’s nothing special about the value t=3, we could apply this to any other point in time, so we consider this expression ds/dt to be a function of t, something where I can give you some time t, and you can give back to me the value of this ratio at that time; the velocity as a function of time. So for example, when I had the computer draw this bump curve here representing the velocity function, the one you can think of as the slope of this distance vs. time function at each point, here’s what I had computer do: First, I chose some small value for dt, like 0.01. Then, I had the computer look at many times t between 0 and 10, and compute the distance function s at (t + dt), minus the value of this function at t. That is, the difference in the distance traveled between the given time t, and the time 0.01 seconds after that. Then divide that difference by the change in time dt, and this gives the velocity in meters per second around each point in time. With this formula, you can give the computer any curve representing the distance function s(t), and it can figure out the curve representing the velocity v(t). So now would be a good time to pause, reflect, make sure this idea of relating distance to velocity by looking at tiny changes in time dt makes sense, because now we’re going to tackle the paradox of the derivative head-on. This idea of ds/dt, a tiny change in the value of the function s divided by a tiny change in the input t, is almost what the derivative is. Even though out car’s speedometer will look at an actual change in time like 0.01 seconds to compute speed, and even though my program here for finding a velocity function given a position function also uses a concrete value of dt, in pure math, the derivative is not this ratio ds/dt for any specific choice of dt. It is whatever value that ratio approaches as the choice for dt approaches 0 Visually, asking what this ratio approaches has really a nice meaning: For any specific choice of dt, this ratio ds/dt is the slope of a line passing through two points on the graph, right? Well, as dt approaches 0, and those two points approach each other, the slope of that line approaches the slope of a line tangent to the graph at whatever point t we’re looking at. So the true, honest to goodness derivative, is not the rise-over-run slope between two nearby points on the graph; it’s equal to the slope of a line tangent to the graph at a single point. Notice what I’m not saying: I’m not saying that the derivative is whatever happens when dt is infinitely small, nor am I saying that you plug in 0 for dt. This dt is always a finitely small, nonzero value, it’s just approaching 0 is all. So even though change in an instant makes no sense, this idea of letting dt approach 0 is a really clever backdoor way to talk reasonably about the rate of change at a single point in time. Isn’t that neat? It’s flirting with the paradox of change in an instant without ever needing to touch it. And it comes with such a nice visual intuition as the slope of a tangent line at a single point on this graph. Since change in an instant still makes no sense, I think it’s healthiest for you to think of this slope not as some “instantaneous rate of change”, but as the best constant approximation for rate of change around a point. It’s worth saying a few words on notation here. Throughout this video I’ve been using “dt” to refer to a tiny change in t with some actual size, and “ds” to refer to the resulting tiny change in s, which again has an actual size. This is because that’s how I want you to think about them. But the convention in calculus is that whenever you’re using the letter “d” like this, you’re announcing that the intention is to eventually see what happens as dt approaches 0. For example, the honest-to-goodness derivative of the function s(t) is written as ds/dt, even though the derivative is not a fraction, per se, but whatever that fraction approaches for smaller and smaller nudges in t. A specific example should help here. You might think that asking about what this ratio approaches for smaller and smaller values of dt would make it much more difficult to compute, but strangely it actually makes things easier. Let’s say a given distance vs. time function was exactly t3. So after 1 second, the car has traveled 13=1 meters, after 2 seconds, it’s traveled 23=8 meters, and so on. What I’m about to do might seem somewhat complicated, but once the dust settles it really is simpler, and it’s the kind of thing you only ever have to do once in calculus. Let’s say you want the velocity, ds/dt, at a specific time, like t=2. And for now, think of dt having an actual size; we’ll let it go to 0 in just a bit. The tiny change in distance between 2 seconds and 2+dt seconds is s(2+dt)-s(2), and we divide by dt. Since s(t) = t3, that numerator is (2+dt)3 - 23. Now this, we can work out algebraically. And again bear with me, there’s a reason I’m showing you the details. Expanding the top gives 23 + 3*22dt + 3*2*(dt)2 + (dt)3 - 23. There are several terms here, and I want you to remember that it looks like a mess, but it simplifies. Those 23 terms cancel out. Everything remaining has a dt, so we can divide that out. So the ratio ds/dt has boiled down to 3*22 + two different terms that each have a dt in them. So as dt approaches 0, representing the idea of looking at smaller and smaller changes in time, we can ignore those! By eliminating the need to think of a specific dt, we’ve eliminated much of the complication in this expression! So what we’re left with is a nice clean 3*22. This means the slope of a line tangent to the point at t=2 on the graph of t3 is exactly 3*22, or 12. Of course, there was nothing special about choosing t=2; more generally we’d say the derivative of t3, as a function of t, is 3*t2. That’s beautiful. This derivative is a crazy complicated idea: We’ve got tiny changes in distance over tiny changes in time, but instead of looking at any specific tiny change in time we start talking about what this thing approaches. I mean, it’s a lot to think about. Yet we’ve come out with such a simple expression: 3t2. In practice, you would not go through all that algebra each time. Knowing that the derivative t3 is 3t2 is one of those things all calculus students learn to do immediately without rederiving each time. And in the next video, I’ll show ways to think about this and many other derivative formulas in nice geometric ways. The point I want to make by showing you the guts here is that when you consider the change in distance of a change in time for any specific value of dt, you’d have a whole mess of algebra riding along. But by considering what this ratio approaches as dt approaches 0, it lets you ignore much of that mess, and actually simplifies the problem. Another reason I wanted to show you a concrete derivative like this is that it gives a good example for the kind of paradox that come about when you believe in the illusion of an instantaneous rate of change. Think about this car traveling according to this t3 distance function, and consider its motion at moment t=0. Now ask yourself whether or not the car is moving at that time. On the one hand, we can compute its speed at that point using the derivative of this function, 3t2, which is 0 at time t=0. Visually, this means the tangent line to the graph at that point is perfectly flat, so the car’s quote unquote “instantaneous velocity” is 0, which suggests it’s not moving. But on the other hand, if it doesn’t start moving at time 0, when does it start moving? Really, pause and ponder this for a moment, is that car moving at t=0? Do you see the paradox? The issue is that the question makes no sense, it references the idea of of change in a moment, which doesn’t exist. And that’s just not what the derivative measures. What it means for the derivative of the distance function to be 0 at this point is that the best constant approximation for the car’s velocity around that point is 0 meters per second. For example, between t=0 and t=0.1 seconds, the car does move... it moves 0.001 meters. That’s very small, and importantly it’s very small compared to the change in time, an average speed of only 0.01 meters per second. What it means for the derivative of this motion to be 0 is that for smaller and smaller nudges in time, this ratio of change in distance over change in time approaches 0, though in this case it never actually hits it. But that’s not to say the car is static. Approximating its movement with a constant velocity of 0, after all, just an approximation. So if you ever hear someone refer to the derivative as an “instantaneous rate of change”, a phrase which is intrinsically oxymoronic, think of it as a conceptual shorthand for “the best constant approximation for the rate of change” In the following videos I’ll talk more about the derivative; what does it look like in different contexts, how do you actually compute it, what’s it useful for, things like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ	3Blue1Brown	video	Now that we've seen what a derivative means, and what it has to do with rates of change. Our next step is to learn how to actually compute these guys, as in if I give you some kind of function with an explicit formula you'd want to be able to find what the formula for its derivative is. Maybe it's obvious, but I think it's worth stating explicitly why this is an important thing to be able to do. Why much of a calculus students time ends up going towards grappling with derivatives of abstract functions rather than thinking about concrete rate of change problems, Is because a lot of real-world phenomena. The sort of things that we want to use calculus to analyze are modeled using polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential's and other pure functions like that. So if you build up some fluency with the ideas of rates of change for those kinds of pure abstract functions. It gives you a language to more readily talk about the rates at which things change in concrete situations that you might be using calculus to model. But it is way too easy for this process to feel like just memorizing a list of rules. And if that happens, if you get that feeling it's all so easy to lose sight of the fact that derivatives are fundamentally about just looking at tiny changes to some quantity, and how that relates to a resulting tiny change in another quantity. So in this video and in the next one, my aim is to show you how you can think about a few of these rules intuitively and geometrically. And I really want to encourage you to never forget that tiny nudges are at the heart of derivatives. let's start with a simple function like f(x) = x^2, what if I asked you it's derivative. That is if you were to look at some value x like x = 2 and compare it to a value slightly bigger, just dx bigger. What's the corresponding change in the value of the function df, and in particular what's df divided by dx - The rate at which this function is changing per unit change in x as a first step for intuition. We know that you can think of this ratio df/dx as the slope of a tangent line to the graph of x^2, and from that you can see that the slope generally increases as x increases. At 0 the tangent line is flat so the slope is 0 at x = 1. That's something a bit steeper at x = 2, it's steeper still but looking at graphs isn't generally the best way to understand the precise formula for a derivative, for that it's best to take a more literal look at what x^2 actually means. And in this case let's go ahead and picture a square whose side length is x if you increase x by some tiny nudge, some little dx. What's the resulting change in the area of that square, that slight change, in area is what df means in this context. It's the tiny increase to the value of f(x) = x^2 caused by increasing x by that tiny nudge dx. Now you can see that there's three new bits of area in this diagram, two thin rectangles and a miniscule square. The two thin rectangles each have side lengths of x and dx so they account for two times x * dx units of new area. For example let's say x was 3 and dx was 0.01. Then that new area from these two thin rectangles would be 2 * 3 * 0.01 which is 0.06, about 6 times the size of dx. That little square there has an area of dx^2, but you should think of that as being really tiny, negligibly tiny. For example, if dx was 0.01, that would be only 0.0001. And keep in mind, I'm drawing DX with a fair bit of width here just so we can actually see it, but always remember - in principle dx should be thought of as a truly tiny amount and for those truly tiny amounts. A good rule of thumb is that you can ignore anything that includes a dx raised to a power greater than 1. That is a tiny change squared is a negligible change what this leaves us with is that df is just some multiple of dx, and that multiple 2x which you could also write as df/dx is the derivative of x^2. For example, if you were starting at x = 3, then as you slightly increase x the rate of change in the area per unit change in length added dx^2/dx would be 2 * 3 or 6. And if instead you were starting at x = 5, the rate of change would be ten units of area per unit change in x. Let's go ahead and try a different simple function f(x) = x^3. This is going to be the geometric view of the stuff that I went through algebraically in the last video. What's nice here is that we can think of x^3 as the volume of an actual cube, whose side lengths are x. And when you increase x by a tiny nudge, a tiny dx the resulting increase in volume is what I have here in yellow. That represents all the volume in a cube with side lengths x plus dx. That's not already in the original cube, the one with side length x. It's nice to think of this new volume as broken up into multiple components, but almost all of it comes from these three square faces, or set a little more precisely as dx approaches zero. Precisely as dx approaches zero, those three squares comprise a portion closer and closer to 100% of that new yellow volume. Each of those thin squares has a volume of x^2 * dx, the area of the face times that little thickness dx. So in total this gives us 3x^2 dx of volume change. And to be sure there are other slivers of volume here, along the edges, and that tiny one in the corner. But all of that volume is going to be proportional to dx^2 or dx^3 so we can safely ignore them. Again this is ultimately because they're going to be divided by dx, and if there's still any dx remaining then those terms aren't going to survive the process of letting dx approach 0. What this means is that the derivative of x^3, the rate at which x^3 changes per unit change of x is 3x^2. What that means in terms of graphical intuition is that the slope of the graph of x^3 at every single point x is exactly 3x^2. And reasoning about that slope, it should make sense that this derivative is high on the left, and then zero at the origin, and then high again as you move to the right. But just thinking in terms of the graph would never have landed us on the precise quantity 3x^2. For that we had to take a much more direct look at what x^3 actually means now in practice. You wouldn't necessarily think of the square every time you're taking the derivative of x^2. Nor would you necessarily think of this cube whenever you're taking the derivative of x^3, both of them fall under a pretty recognizable pattern for polynomial terms the derivative of x^4 turns out to be 4x^3. The derivative of x^5 is 5x^4. The derivative of x to the n for any power n is nx^(n-1). This right here is what's known in the business as the power rule. In practice we all quickly just get jaded and think about this symbolically as the exponent hopping down in front leaving behind one less than itself. Rarely pausing to think about the geometric delights that underlie these derivatives. That's the kind of thing that happens when these tend to fall in the middle of much longer computations. But rather than tracking it all off to symbolic patterns let's just take a moment and think about why this works. For powers beyond just 2 and 3 when you nudge that input x, increasing it slightly to x + dx, working out the exact value of that nudged output would involve multiplying together these n separate x + dx terms. The full expansion would be really complicated but part of the point of derivatives is that most of that complication can be ignored. The first term in your expansion is x^n, this is analogous to the area of the original square or the volume of the original cube from our previous examples. For the next terms in the expansion, you can choose mostly x's with a single dx since there are n radicals from which you could have chosen that single dx. This gives us n separate terms all of which include n-1 x's times a dx giving a value of x^(n-1) times dx. This is analogous to how the majority of the new area in the square came from those two bars each with area x * dx, or how the bulk of the new volume in the cube came from those three thin squares. Each of which had a volume of x^2 times dx. There will be many other terms of this expansion but all of them are just going to be some multiple of dx^2 so we can safely ignore them. And what that means is that all but a negligible portion of the increase in the output comes from n copies of this x to the (n-1) * dx - that's what it means. For the derivative of x^n to be n * x^(n-1) and even though, like I said in practice, you'll find yourself performing this derivative quickly and symbolically imagining the exponent, hopping down to the front. Every now and then it's nice to just step back and remember why these rules work. Not just because it's pretty, and not just because it helps remind us that math actually makes sense and isn't just a pile of formulas to memorize. But because it flexes that very important muscle of thinking about derivatives in terms of tiny nudges. As another example think of the function f(x) = 1/x. Now, on the one hand you could just blindly try applying the power rule since 1/x is the same as writing x^(-1). That would involve letting the negative 1 hop down in front leaving behind 1 less than itself which is -2. But let's have some fun and see if we can reason about this geometrically rather than just plugging it through some formula. The value 1/x is asking what number multiplied by x equals 1, so here's how I'd like to visualize it - imagine a little rectangular puddle of water sitting in two dimensions whose area is 1, and let's say that its width is x. Which means that the height has to be 1/x since the total area of it is 1, so if x was stretched out to 2 then that height is forced down to 1/2 and if you increased x up to 3 then the other side has to be squished down to 1/3 this is a nice way to think about the graph of 1 x. By the way, if you think of this with x of the puddle as being in the xy plane then that corresponding output 1/x, the height of the graph above that point is whatever the height of your puddle has to be to maintain an area of 1. So with this visual in mind for the derivative, imagine nudging up that value of x by some tiny amount, some tiny dx. How must the height of this rectangle change so that the area of the puddle remains constant at 1 - That is increasing the width by dx, add some new area to the right here so the puddle has to decrease in height by some d(1/x) so that the area lost off of that top cancels out the area gained. You should think of that d(1/x) as being a negative amount. By the way since it's decreasing the height of the rectangle and you know what I'm going to leave the last few steps here for you for you to pause and ponder and work out an ultimate expression and once you reason out what D of 1 over X / DX should be I want you to compare it to what you would have gotten if you had just blindly applied the power rule purely symbolically to X to the negative one and while I'm encouraging a deposit ponder here's another fun challenge if you're feeling up to it see if you can reason through what the derivative of the square root of x should be to finish things off I want to tackle one more type of function trigonometric functions and in particular let's focus on the sine function so for this section I'm going to assume that you're already familiar with how to think about trig functions using the unit circle the circle with the radius one centered at the origin for a given value of theta like say zero point eight you imagine yourself walking around the circle starting from the rightmost point until you've traversed that distance of zero point eight in arc length this is the same thing as saying that the angle right here is exactly theta radians since the circle has a radius of one then what sine of theta means is the height of that point above the x-axis and as your theta value increases and you walk around the circle your height Bob's up and down between negative one and one so when you graph sine of theta versus theta you get this wave pattern the quintessential wave pattern and just from looking at this graph we can start to get a feel for the shape of the derivative of the sine the slope at zero is something positive since sine of theta is increasing there and as we move to the right and sine of theta approaches its peak that slope goes down to zero then the slope is negative for a little while while the sine is decreasing before coming back up to zero as the sine graph levels out and as you continue thinking this through and drawing it out if you're familiar with the graph of trig functions you might guess that this derivative graph should be exactly cosine of theta since all the peaks and valleys line up perfectly with where the peaks and valleys for the cosine function should be and spoiler alert the derivative is in fact the cosine of theta but aren't you a little curious about why it's precisely cosine of theta I mean you could have all sorts of functions with peaks and valleys at the same points that have roughly the same shape but who knows maybe the derivative of sine could have turned out to be some entirely new type of function that just happens to have a similar shape well just like the previous examples a more exact understanding of the derivative requires looking at what the function actually represents rather than looking at the graph of the function so think back to that walk around the unit circle having traversed an arc with length theta and thinking about sine of theta as the height of that point now zoom in to that point on the circle and consider a slight nudge of D theta along their circumference a tiny step in your walk around the unit circle how much does that tiny step change the sign of theta how much does this increase D theta of arc length increase the height above the x-axis well zoomed in close enough the circle basically looks like a straight line in this neighborhood so let's go ahead and think of this right triangle where the hypotenuse of that right triangle represents the nudge D theta along the circumference and that left side here represents the change in height the resulting D sine of theta now this tiny triangle is actually similar to this larger triangle here with the defining angle theta and whose hypotenuse is the radius of the circle with length one specifically this little angle right here is precisely equal to theta radians now think about what the derivative of sine is supposed to mean it's the ratio between that D sine of theta the tiny change to the height divided by D theta the tiny change to the input of the function and from the picture we can see that that's the ratio between the length of the side adjacent to the angle theta divided by the hypotenuse well let's see adjacent divided by hypotenuse that's exactly what the cosine of theta means that's the definition of the cosine so this gives us two different really nice ways of thinking about how the derivative of sine is cosine one of them is looking at the graph and getting a loose feel for the shape of things based on thinking about the slope of the sine graph at every single point and the other is a more precise line of reasoning looking at the unit circle itself for those of you that like to pause and ponder see if you can try a similar line of reasoning to find what the derivative of the cosine of theta should be in the next video I'll talk about how you can take derivatives of functions who combine simple functions like these ones either as sums or products or function compositions things like that and similar to this video the goal is going to be to understand each one geometrically in a way that makes it intuitively reasonable and somewhat more memorable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA	3Blue1Brown	video	In the last videos I talked about the derivatives of simple functions, things like powers of x, sin(x), and exponentials, the goal being to have a clear picture or intuition to hold in your mind that explains where these formulas come from. Most functions you use to model the world involve mixing, combining and tweaking these these simple functions in some way; so our goal now is to understand how to take derivatives of more complicated combinations; where again, I want you to have a clear picture in mind for each rule. This really boils down into three basic ways to combine functions together: Adding them, multiplying them, and putting one inside the other; also known as composing them. Sure, you could say subtracting them, but that’s really just multiplying the second by -1, then adding. Likewise, dividing functions is really just the same as plugging one into the function 1/x, then multiplying. Most functions you come across just involve layering on these three types of combinations, with no bound on how monstrous things can become. But as long as you know how derivatives play with those three types of combinations, you can always just take it step by step and peal through the layers. So, the question is, if you know the derivatives of two functions, what is the derivative of their sum, of their product, and of the function compositions between them? The sum rule is the easiest, if somewhat tounge-twisting to say out loud: The derivative of a sum of two functions is the sum of their derivatives. But it’s worth warming up with this example by really thinking through what it means to take a derivative of a sum of two functions, since the derivative patterns for products and function composition won’t be so straight forward, and will require this kind of deeper thinking. The function f(x) = sin(x) + x2 is a function where, for every input, you add together the values of sin(x) and x2 at that point. For example, at x = 0.5, the height of the sine graph is given by this bar, the height of the x2 parabola is given by this bar, and their sum is the length you get by stacking them together. For the derivative, you ask what happens as you nudge the input slightly, maybe increasing it to 0.5+dx. The difference in the value of f between these two values is what we call df. Well, pictured like this, I think you’ll agree that the total change in height is whatever the change to the sine graph is, what we might call d(sin(x)), plus whatever the change to x2 is, d(x2). We know the derivative of sine is cosine, and what that means is that this little change d(sin(x)) would be about cos(x)dx. It’s proportional to the size of dx, with a proportionality constant equal to cosine of whatever input we started at. Similarly, because the derivative of x2 is 2x, the change in the height of the x2 graph is about 2x*dx. So, df/dx, the ratio of the tiny change to the sum function to the tiny change in x that caused it, is indeed cos(x)+2x, the sum of the derivatives of its parts. But like I said, things are a bit different for products. Let’s think through why, in terms of tiny nudges. In this case, I don’t think graphs are our best bet for visualizing things. Pretty commonly in math, all levels of math really, if you’re dealing with a product of two things, it helps to try to understand it as some form of area. In this case, you might try to configure some mental setup of a box whose side-lengths are sin(x) and x2. What would that mean? Well, since these are functions, you might think of these sides as adjustable; dependent on the value of x, which you might think of as a number that you can freely adjust. So, just getting the feel for this, focus on that top side, whose changes as the function sin(x). As you change the value of x up from 0, it increases in up to a length of 1 as sin(x) moves towards its peak. After that, it starts decreasing as sin(x) comes down from 1. And likewise, that height changes as x2. So f(x), defined as this product, is the area of this box. For the derivative, think about how a tiny change to x by dx influences this area; that resulting change in area is df. That nudge to x causes the width to change by some small d(sin(x)), and the height to change by some d(x2). This gives us three little snippets of new area: A thin rectangle on the bottom, whose area is its width, sin(x), times its thin height, d(x2); there’s a thin rectangle on the right, whose area is its height, x2, times its thin width, d(sin(x)). And there’s also bit in the corner. But we can ignore it, since its area will ultimately be proportional to dx2, which becomes negligible as dx goes to 0. This is very similar to what I showed last video, with the x2 diagram. Just like then, keep in mind that I’m using somewhat beefy changes to draw things, so we can see them, but in principle think of dx as very very small, meaning d(x2) and d(sin(x)) are also very very small. Applying what we know about the derivative of sine and x2, that tiny change d(x2) is 2x*dx, and that tiny change d(sin(x)) is cos(x)dx. Dividing out by that dx, the derivative df/dx is sin(x) by the derivative of x2, plus x2 by the derivative of sine. This line of reasoning works for any two functions. A common mnemonic for the product rule is to say in your head “left d right, right d left”. In this example, sin(x)*x2, “left d right” means you take the left function, in this case sin(x), times the derivative of the right, x2, which gives 2x. Then you add “right d left”: the right function, x2, times the derivative of the left, cos(x). Out of context, this feels like kind of a strange rule, but when you think of this adjustable box you can actually see how those terms represent slivers of area. “Left d right” is the area of this bottom rectangle, and “right d left” is the area of this rectangle on the right. By the way, I should mention that if you multiply by a constant, say 2*sin(x), things end up much simpler. The derivative is just that same constant times the derivative of the function, in this case 2*cos(x). I’ll leave it to you to pause and ponder to verify that this makes sense. Aside from addition and multiplication, the other common way to combine functions that comes up all the time is function composition. For example, let’s say we take the function x2, and shove it on inside sin(x) to get a new function, sin(x2). What’s the derivative of this new function? Here I’ll choose yet another way to visualize things, just to emphasize that in creative math, we have lots of options. I’ll put up three number lines. The top one will hold the value of x, the second one will represent the value of x2, and that third line will hold the value of sin(x2). That is, the function x2 gets you from line 1 to line 2, and the function sine gets you from line 2 to line 3. As I shift that value of x, maybe up to the value 3, then value on the second shifts to whatever x2 is, in this case 9. And that bottom value, being the sin(x2), will go over to whatever the sin(9) is. So for the derivative, let’s again think of nudging that x-value by some little dx, and I always think it’s helpful to think of x starting as some actual number, maybe 1.5. The resulting nudge to this second value, the change to x2 caused by such a dx, is what we might call d(x2). You can expand this as 2x*dx, which for our specific input that length would be 2*(1.5)*dx, but it helps to keep it written as d(x2) for now. In fact let me go one step further and give a new name to x2, maybe h, so this nudge d(x2) is just dh. Now think of that third value, which is pegged at sin(h). It’s change d(sin(h)); the tiny change caused by the nudge dh. By the way, the fact that it’s moving left while the dh bump is to the right just means that this change d(sin(h)) is some negative number. Because we know the derivative of sine, we can expand d(sin(h)) as cos(h)*dh; that’s what it means for the derivative of sine to be cosine. Unfolding things, replacing h with x2 again, that bottom nudge is cos(x2)d(x2). And we could unfold further, noting that d(x2) is 2x*dx. And it’s always good to remind yourself of what this all actually means. In this case where we started at x = 1.5 up top, this means that the size of that nudge on the third line is about cos(1.52)*2(1.5)*(the size of dx); proportional to the size of dx, where the derivative here gives us that proportionality constant. Notice what we have here, we have the derivative of the outside function, still taking in the unaltered inside function, and we multiply it by the derivative of the inside function. Again, there’s nothing special about sin(x) and x2. If you have two functions g(x) and h(x), the derivative of their composition function g(h(x)) is the derivative of g, evaluated at h(x), times the derivative of h. This is what we call the “chain rule”. Notice, for the derivative of g, I’m writing it as dg/dh instead of dg/dx. On the symbolic level, this serves as a reminder that you still plug in the inner function to this derivative. But it’s also an important reflection of what this derivative of the outer function actually represents. Remember, in our three-lines setup, when we took the derivative of sine on the bottom, we expanded the size of the nudge d(sin) as cos(h)*dh. This was because we didn’t immediately know how the size of that bottom nudge depended on x, that’s kind of the whole thing we’re trying to figure out, but we could take the derivative with respect to the intermediate variable h. That is, figure out how to express the size of that nudge as multiple of dh. Then it unfolded by figuring out what dh was. So in this chain rule expression, we’re saying look at the ratio between a tiny change in g, the final output, and a tiny change in h that caused it, h being the value that we’re plugging into g. Then multiply that by the tiny change in h divided by the tiny change in x that caused it. The dh’s cancel to give the ratio between a tiny change in the final output, and the tiny change to the input that, through a certain chain of events, brought it about. That cancellation of dh is more than just a notational trick, it’s a genuine reflection of the tiny nudges that underpin calculus. So those are the three basic tools in your belt to handle derivatives of functions that combine many smaller things: The sum rule, the product rule and the chain rule. I should say, there’s a big difference between knowing what the chain rule and product rules are, and being fluent with applying them in even the most hairy of situations. I said this at the start of the series, but it’s worth repeating: Watching videos, any videos, about these mechanics of calculus will never substitute for practicing them yourself, and building the muscles to do these computations yourself. I wish I could offer to do that for you, but I’m afraid the ball is in your court, my friend, to seek out practice. What I can offer, and what I hope I have offered, is to show you where these rules come from, to show that they’re not just something to be memorized and hammered away; but instead are natural patterns that you too could have discovered by just patiently thinking through what a derivative actually means.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIpDrF7Es	3Blue1Brown	video	What's so special about Euler's number e? I've introduced a few derivative formulas but a really important one that Ieft out was exponentials. So here, I want to talk about the derivatives of functions like Two to the x, seven to the x, and also to show why e to the x is arguably the most important of the exponentials. First of all, to get an intuition, let's just focus on the function two to the x. And let's think of that input as a time, "t," maybe in days, and the output, 2 to the t, as a population size perhaps of a particularly fertile band of pi creatures which doubles every single day. And actually, instead of population size, which grows in discrete little jumps with each new baby pi creature, maybe let's think of 2 to the t as the total mass of the population. I think that better reflects the continuity of this function, don't you? So, for example, at time t=0, the total mass is 2 to the 0 equals 1, for the mass of one creature. At t=1 day, the population has grown to 2 to the 1 = 2 creature masses. At day t=2, it's t squared, or 4, and in general, it just keeps doubling every day. For the derivative, we want dm/dt, the rate at which this population mass is growing, thought of as a tiny change in the mass divided by a tiny change in time. And let's start by thinking of the rate of change over a full day, say, between day 3 and day 4. Well, in this case it grows from 8 to 16, so that's 8 new creature masses added over the course of one day. And notice, that rate of growth equals the population size at the start of the day. Between day 4 and day 5, it grows from 16 to 32. So that's a rate of 16 new creature masses per day. Which, again, equals the population size at the start of the day. And in general, this rate of growth over a full day equals the population size at the start of that day. So it might be tempting to say that this means the derivative of 2 to the t equals itself. That the rate of change of this function at a given time t, is equal to, well, the value of that function. And this is definitely in the right direction, but it's not quite correct. What we're doing here is making comparisons over a full day, considering the difference between 2 to the t plus 1, and 2 to the t. but for the derivative, we need to ask what happens for smaller and smaller changes. What's the growth over the course of a tenth of a day? A hundredth of a day? One one-billionth of a day? This is why I had us think of the function as representing population mass since it makes sense to ask about a tiny change in mass over a tiny fraction of a day but it doesn't make as much sense to ask about the tiny change in a discrete population size per second. More abstractly, for a tiny change in time, dt, we want to understand the difference between 2 to the t plus dt and 2 to the t, all divided by dt. A change in the function per unit time, but now we're looking very narrowly around a given point in time, rather than over the course of a full day. And here's the thing: I would love if there was some very clear geometric picture that made everything that's about to follow just pop out, some diagram where you could point to one value, and say, "See! *that* part. That is the derivative of 2 to the t." And if you know of one, please let me know. And while the goal here as with the rest of the series is to maintain a playful spirit of discover, the type of play that follows will have more to do with finding numerical patterns, rather than visual ones. So start by just taking a very close look at this term 2 to the t, plus dt A core property of exponentials is that you can break this up as 2 to the t times 2 to the dt. That really is the most important property of exponents. If you add two values in that exponent, you can break up the output as a product of some kind. This is what lets you relate additive ideas things like tiny steps in time, to multiplicative ideas, things like rates and ratios. I mean, just look at what happens here. After that move, we can factor out the term 2 to the t. which is now just multiplied by 2 to the dt minus 1, all divided by dt. And remember, the derivative of 2 to the t is whatever this whole expression approaches as dt approaches 0. And at first glance that might seem like an unimportant manipulation, but a tremendously important fact is that this term on the right, where all of the dt stuff lives, is completely separate from the t term itself. It doesn't depend on the actual time where we started. You can go off to a calculator and plug in very small values for dt here, for example, maybe typing in 2 to the 0.001 minus 1, divided by 0.001 What you'll find is that for smaller and smaller choices of dt, this value approaches a very specific number, around 0.6931. Don't worry if that number seems mysterious, The central point is that this is some kind of constant. Unlike derivatives of other functions, all of the stuff that depends on dt is separate from the value of t itself. So the derivative of 2 to the t is just itself, but multiplied by some constant And that should kind of make sense, because earlier, it felt like the derivative for 2 to the t should be itself, at least when we were looking at changes over the course of a full day. And evidently, the rate of change for this function over much smaller time scales is not quite equal to itself, but it's proportional to itself, with this very peculiar proportionality constant of 0.6931 And there's not too much special about the number 2 here, if instead we had dealt with the function 3 to the t, the exponential property would also have led us to the conclusion that the derivative of 3 to the t is proportional to itself. But this time it would have had a proportionality constant 1.0986. And for other bases to your exponent you can have fun trying to see what the various proportionality constants are, maying seeing if you can find a pattern in them. For example, if you plug in 8 to the power of a very tiny number minus 1, and divide by that same tiny number, what you'd find is that the relevant proportionality constant is around 2.079, and maybe, just maybe you would notice that this number happens to be exactly three times the constant associated with the base for 2, so these numbers certainly aren't random, there is some kind of pattern, but what is it? What does 2 have to do with the number 0.6931? And what does 8 have to do with the number 2.079? Well, a second question that is ultimately going to explain these mystery constants is whether there's some base where that proportionality constant is one (1), where the derivative of "a"to the power t is not just proportional to itself, but actually equal to itself. And there is! It's the special constant "e," around 2.71828. In fact, it's not just that the number e happens to show up here, this is, in a sense, what defines the number e. If you ask, "why does e, of all numbers, have this property?" It's a little like asking "why does pi, of all numbers happen to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter?" This is, at its heart, what defines this value. All exponential functions are proportional to their own derivative, but e along is the special number so that that proportionality constant is one, meaning e to the t actually equals its own derivative. One way to think of that is that if you look at the graph of e to the t, it has the peculiar property that the slope of a tangent line to any point on this graph equals the height of that point above the horizontal axis. The existence of a function like this answers the question of the mystery constants and it's because it gives a different way to think about functions that are proportional to their own derivative. The key is to use the chain rule. For example, what is the derivative of e to the 3t? Well, you take the derivative of the outermost function, which due to this special nature of e is just itself and then multipliy it by the derivative of that inner function, 3t which is the constant, 3. Or, rather than just applying a rule blindly, you could take this moment to practice the intuition for the chain rule that I talked through last video, thinking about how a slight nudge to t changes the value of 3t and how that intermediate change nudges the final value of e to the 3t. Either way, the point is, e to the power of some constant times t is equal to that same constant times itself. And from here, the question of those mystery constants really just comes down to a certain algebraic manipulation. The number 2 can also be written as e to the natural log of 2. There's nothing fancy here, this is just the definition of the natural log, it asks the question, "e to what equals 2?" So, the function 2 to the t is the same as the function e to the power of the natural log of 2 times t. And from what we just saw, combining the facts that e to the t is its own derivative with the chain rule, the derivative of this function is proportional to itself, with a proportionality constant equal to the natural log of 2. And indeed, if you go plug in the natural log of two to a calculator, you'll find that it's 0.6931, the mystery constant that we ran into earlier. And the same goes for all of the other bases. The mystery proportionality constant that pops up when taking derivatives is just the natural log of the base, the answer to the question, "e to the what equals that base?" In fact, throughout applications of calculus, you rarely see exponentials written as some base to a power t, instead you almost always write the exponential as e to the power of some constant times t. It's all equivalent. I mean any function like 2 to the t or 3 to the t can also be written as e to some constant time t. At the risk of staying over-focused on the symbols here, Ireally want to emphasize that there are many many ways to write down any particular exponential function, and when you see something written as e to some constant time t, that's a choice that we make to write it that way, and the number e is not fundamental to that function itself. What is special about writing exponentials in terms of e like this, is that it gives that constant in the exponent a nice, readable meaning. Here, let me show you what I mean. All sorts of natural phenomena involve some rate of change that's proportional to the thing that's changing. For example, the rate of growth of a population actually does tend to be proportional to the size of the population itself, assuming there isn't some limited resource slowing things down. And if you put a cup of hot water in a cool room, the rate at which the water cools is proportional to the difference in temperature between the room and the water. Or, said a little differently the rate at which that difference changes is proportional to itself. If you invest your money, the rate at which it grows is proportional to the amount of money there at any time. In all of these cases, where some variable's rate of change is proportional to itself the function describing that variable over time is going to look like some kind of exponential. And even though there are lots of ways to write any exponential function, it's very natural to choose to express these functions as e to the power of some constant times t since that constant carries a very natural meaning. It's the same as the proportionality constant between the size of the changing variable and the rate of change. And, as always, I want to thank those who have made this series possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4	3Blue1Brown	video	Let me share with you something I found particularly weird when I was a student first learning calculus. Let’s say you have a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin of the xy-coordinate plane, which is defined using the equation x^2 + y^2 = 5^2. That is, all points on this circle are a distance 5 from the origin, as encapsulated by the pythagorean theorem with the sum of the squares of the legs of this triangle equalling the square of the hypotenuse, 52. And suppose you want to find the slope of a tangent line to this circle, maybe at the point (x, y) = (3, 4). Now, if you’re savvy with geometry, you might already know that this tangent line is perpendicular to the radius line touching that point. But let’s say you don’t already know that, or that you want a technique that generalizes to curves other than circles. As with other problems about slope of tangent lines, they key thought here is to zoom in close enough that the curve basically looks just like its own tangent line, then ask about a tiny step along that curve. The y-component of that little step is what you might call dy, and the x-component is a little dx, so the slope we’re looking for is the rise over run dy/dx. But unlike other tangent-slope problems in calculus, this curve is not the graph of a function, so we cannot take a simple derivative, asking about the size of a tiny nudge to the output of a function caused by some tiny nudge to the input. x is not an input and y is not an output in this case, they’re both just interdependent values related by some equation. This is called an “implicit curve”; it’s just the set of all points (x, y) that satisfy some property written in terms of the two variables x and y. The procedure for finding dy/dx here is what I found very weird as a calculus student, you take the derivative of both sides of this equation like this: For the derivative of x2 you write 2x*dx, similarly y2 becomes 2y*dy, and the derivative of the constant 52 on the right is 0. You can see why this feels strange, right? What does it mean to take a derivative of an expression with multiple variables? And why are we tacking on the little dy and dx in this way? But if you just blindly move forward with what you get here, you can rearrange to find an expression for dy/dx, which in this case comes out to -x/y. So at a point with coordinates (x, y) = (3, 4), that slope would be -¾, evidently. This strange process is called “implicit differentiation”. Don’t worry, I have an explanation for how you can interpret taking a derivative of an expression with two variables like this. But first, I want to set aside this particular problem, and show how this is related to a different type of calculus problem: Related rates. Imagine a 5 meter long ladder up against a wall, where the top of the ladder starts of 4 meters above the ground, which, by the pythagorean theorem, means the bottom is 3 meters away from the wall. And say it’s slipping down the wall in such a way that the top of the ladder is dropping at 1 meter per second. The question is, in that initial moment, what is the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall. It’s interesting, right? That distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall is 100% determined by the distance between the top of the ladder and the floor, so we should have enough information to figure out how the rates of change for each value depend on each other, but it might not be entirely clear at first how to relate the two. First thing’s first, it’s always nice to give names to the quantities we care about. So label the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground y(t), written as a function of time because it’s changing. Likewise, label the distance between the bottom of the ladder and the wall x(t). They key equation here that relates these terms is the pythagorean theorem: x(t)2 + y(t)2 = 52. What makes this equation powerful is that it’s true at all points in time. One way to solve this would be to isolate x(t), figure out what what y(t) must be based this 1 meter/second drop rate, then take a derivative of the resulting function; dx/dt, the rate at which x is changing with respect to time. And that’s fine; it involves a couple layers of using the chain rule, and it will definitely work for you. But I want to show a different way to think about the same thing. This left-hand side of the equation is a function of time, right? It just so happens to equal a constant, meaning this value evidently doesn’t change while time passes, but it’s still written as an expression dependent on time which we can manipulate like any other function with t as an input. In particular, we can take a derivative of the left hand side, which is a way of saying “If I let a little bit of time pass, dt, which causes y to slightly decrease, and x to slightly increase, how much does this expression change”. On the one hand, we know that derivative should be 0, since this expression equals a constant, and constants don’t care about your tiny nudge to time, they remain unchanged. But on the other hand, what do you get by computing the derivative of this left-hand-side? The derivative of x(t)2 is 2*x(t)*(the derivative of x). That’s the chain rule I talked about last video. 2x*dx represents the size of a change to x2 caused by a change to x, and we’re dividing by dt. Likewise, the rate at which y(t)2 is changing is 2*y(t)*(the derivative of y). Evidently, this whole expression must be zero, which is equivalent to saying x2+y2 doesn’t change while the ladder moves. And at the very start, t=0, the height y(t) is 4 meters, the distance x(t) is 3 meters, and since the top of the ladder is dropping at a rate of 1 meter per second, that derivative dy/dt is -1 meters/second. Now this gives us enough information to isolate the derivative dx/dt, which, when you work it out, is (4/3) meters per second. Now compare this to the problem of finding the slope of tangent line to the circle. In both cases, we had the equation x2 + y2 = 52, and in both cases we ended up taking the derivative of each side of this expression. But for the ladder problem, these expressions were functions of time, so taking the derivative has a clear meaning: it’s the rate at which this expression changes as time change. But what makes the circle situation strange is that rather than saying a small amount of time dt has passed, which causes x and y to change, the derivative has the tiny nudges dx and dy both just floating free, not tied to some other common variable like time. Let me show you how you can think about this: Give this expression x2 + y2 a name, maybe S. S is essentially a function of two variables, it takes every point (x, y) on the plane and associates it with a number. For points on this circle, that number is 25. If you step off that circle away from the center, that value would be bigger. For other points (x, y) closer to the origin, that value is smaller. What it means to take a derivative of this expression, a derivative of S, is to consider a tiny change to both these variables, some tiny change dx to x, and some tiny change dy to y –and not necessarily one that keeps you on this circle, by the way, it’s just some tiny step in any direction on the xy-plane– and ask how much the value of S changes. That difference in the value of S, from the original point to the nudged point, is what I’m writing as “dS”. For example, in this picture we’re starting at a point where x is 3 and y is 4, and let’s just say that step dx is... -0.02, and that dy is -0.01. Then the decrease to S, the amount the x2+y2 changes over that step, will be around 2(3)(-0.02) + 2(4)(-0.01). That’s what this derivative expression 2x*dx + 2y*dy means, it tells you how much the value x2+y2 changes, as determined by the point (x, y) where you started, and the tiny step (dx, dy) that you take. As with all things derivative, this is only an approximation, but it gets more and more true for smaller and smaller choices of dx and dy. The key point is that when you restrict yourself to steps along this circle, you’re essentially saying you want to ensure that this value S doesn’t change; it starts at a value of 25, and you want to keep it at a value of 25; that is, dS should be 0. So setting this expression 2x*dx + 2y*dy equal to 0 is the condition under which a tiny step stays on the circle. Again, this is only an approximation. Speaking more precisely, that condition keeps you on a tangent line of the circle, not the circle itself, but for tiny enough steps those are essentially the same thing. Of course, there’s nothing special about the expression x2+y2 = 52 here. You could have some other expression involving x’s and y’s, representing some other curve, and taking the derivative of both sides like this would give you a way to relate dx to dy for tiny steps along that curve. It’s always nice to think through more examples, so consider the expression sin(x)*y2 = x, which corresponds to many U-shaped curves on the plane. Those curves represent all the points (x, y) of the plane where the value of sin(x)*y2 equals the value of x. Now imagine taking some tiny step with components (dx, dy), and not necessarily one that keeps you on the curve. Taking the derivative of each side of this equation will tell us how much the value of that side changes during this step. On the left side, the product rule that we found in the last video tells us that this should be “left d-right plus right d-left”: sin(x)*(the change to y2), which is 2y*dy, plus y2*(the change to sin(x)), which is cos(x)*dx. The right side is simply x, so the size of a change to the value is exactly dx, right? Setting these two sides equal to each other is a way of saying “whatever your tiny step with coordinates (dx, dy) is, if it’s going to keep us on this curve, the values of both the left-hand side and the right-hand side must change by the same amount.” That’s the only way this top equation can remain true. From there, depending on what problem you’re solving, you could manipulate further with algebra, where perhaps the most common goal is to find dy divided by dx. As one more example, let me show how you can use this technique to help find new derivative formulas. I’ve mentioned in a footnote video that the derivative of ex is itself, but what about the derivative of its inverse function the natural log of x? The graph of ln(x) can be thought of as an implicit curve; all the points on the xy plane where y = ln(x), it just happens to be the case that the x’s and y’s of this equation aren’t as intermingled as they were in other examples. The slope of this graph, dy/dx, should be the derivative of ln(x), right? Well, to find that, first rearrange this equation y = ln(x) to be ey = x. This is exactly what the natural log of x means; it’s saying e to the what equals x. Since we know the derivative of ey, we can take the derivative of both sides, effectively asking how a tiny step with components (dx, dy) changes the value of each side. To ensure the step stays on the curve, the change to the left side of the equation, which is ey*dy, must equals the change to the right side, which is dx. Rearranging, this means dy/dx, the slope of our graph, equals 1/ey. And when we’re on this curve, ey is by definition the same as x, so evidently the slope is 1/x. An expression for the slope of the graph of function in terms of x like this is the derivative of that function, so evidently the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. By the way, all of this is a little peek into multivariable calculus, where you consider functions with multiple inputs, and how they change as you tweak those inputs. The key, as always, is to have a clear image in your head of what tiny nudges are at play, and how exactly they depend on each other. Next up, I’ll talk about about what exactly a limit is, and how it’s used to formalize the idea of a derivative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA	3Blue1Brown	video	The last several videos have been about the idea of a derivative, and before moving on to integrals, I want to take some time to talk about limits. To be honest, the idea of a limit is not really anything new. If you know what the word “approach” means you pretty much already know what a limit is, you could say the rest is a matter of assigning fancy notation to the intuitive idea of one value getting closer to another. But there are actually a few reasons to devote a full video to this topic. For one thing it’s worth showing is how the way I’ve been describing derivatives so far lines up with the the formal definition of a derivative as it’s typically presented in most courses and textbooks. I want to give you some confidence that thinking of terms like dx and df as concrete non-zero nudges is not just some trick for building intuition; it’s actually backed up by the formal definition of a derivative in all its rigor. I also want to shed a little light on what exactly mathematicians mean by “approach”, in terms of something called the "epsilon delta" definition of limits. Then we’ll finish off with a clever trick for computing limits called L’Hopital’s rule. So first thing’s first, let’s take a look at the formal definition of the derivative. As a reminder, when you have some function f(x), to think about the derivative at a particular input, maybe x=2, you start by imagining nudging that input by some tiny dx, and looking at the resulting change to the output, df. The ratio df/dx, which can nicely be thought of as the rise-over-run slope between the starting point on the graph and the nudged point, is almost the derivative. The actual derivative is whatever this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0. Just to spell out what is meant here, that nudge to the output “df” is is the difference between f(starting-input + dx) and f(starting-input); the change to the output caused by the nudge dx. To express that you want to find what this ratio approaches as dx approaches 0, you write “l-i-m”, for limit, with “dx arrow 0” below it. Now, you’ll almost never see terms with a lowercase d, like dx, inside a limit like this. Instead the standard is to use a different variable, like delta-x, or commonly “h” for some reason. The way I like to think of it is that terms with this lowercase d in the typical derivative expression have built into them the idea of a limit, the idea that dx is supposed to eventually approach 0. So in a sense this lefthand side “df/dx”, the ratio we’ve been thinking about for the past few videos, is just shorthand for what the righthand side spells out in more detail, writing out exactly what we mean by df, and writing out the limiting process explicitly. And that righthand side is the formal definition of a derivative, as you’d commonly see it in any calculus textbook Now, if you’ll pardon me for a small rant here, I want to emphasize that nothing about this righthand side references the paradoxical idea of an “infinitely small” change. The point of limits is to avoid that. This value h is the exact same thing as the “dx” I’ve been referencing throughout the series. It’s a nudge to the input of f with some nonzero, finitely small size, like 0.001, it’s just that we’re analyzing what happens for arbitrarily small choices of h. In fact, the only reason people introduce a new variable name into this formal definition, rather than just using dx, is to be super-extra clear that these changes to the input are ordinary numbers that have nothing to do with the infinitesimal. You see, there are others who like to interpret dx as an “infinitely small change”, whatever that would mean, or to just say that dx and df are nothing more than symbols that shouldn’t be taken too seriously. But by now in the series, you know that I’m not really a fan of either of those views, I think you can and should interpret dx as a concrete, finitely small nudge, just so long as you remember to ask what happens as it approaches 0. For one thing, and I hope the past few videos have helped convince you of this, that helps to build a stronger intuition for where the rules of calculus actually come from. But it’s not just some trick for building intuitions. Everything I’ve been saying about derivatives with this concrete-finitely-small-nudge philosophy is just a translation of the formal definition of derivatives. Long story short, the big fuss about limits is that they let us avoid talking about infinitely small changes by instead asking what happens as the size of some change to our variable approaches 0. And that brings us to goal #2: Understanding exactly it means for one value to approach another. For example, consider the function [(2+h)3 - 23]/h. This happens to be the expression that pops out if you unravel the definition for the derivative of x3 at x=2, but let’s just think of it as any ol’ function with an input h. Its graph is this nice continuous looking parabola. But actually, if you think about what’s going at h=0, plugging that in you’d get 0/0, which is not defined. Just ask siri. So really, this graph has a hole at that point. You have to exaggerate to draw that hole, often with a little empty circle like this, but keep in mind the function is perfectly well-defined for inputs as close to 0 as you want. And wouldn’t you agree that as h approaches 0, the corresponding output, the height of this graph, approaches 12? And it doesn’t matter which side you come at it from. That the limit of this ratio as h goes to 0 equals 12. But imagine you’re a mathematician inventing calculus, and someone skeptically asks “well what exactly do you mean by approach?” That would be an annoying question. I mean, come on, we all know what it means for one value to get closer to another. But let me show you a way to answer completely unambiguously. For a given range of inputs within some distance of 0, excluding the forbidden point 0, look at the corresponding outputs, all possible heights of the graph above that range. As that range of input values closes in more and more tightly around 0, the range of output values closes in more and more closely around 12. The size of that range of outputs can be made as small as you want. As a counterexample, consider a function that looks like this, which is also not defined at 0, but kind of jumps at that point. As you approach h = 0 from the right, the function approaches 2, but as you come at 0 from the left, it approaches 1. Since there’s not a clear, unambiguous value that this function approaches as h approaches 0, the limit is simply not defined at that point. When you look at any range of inputs around 0, and the corresponding range of outputs, as you shrink that input range the corresponding outputs don’t narrow in on any specific value. Instead those outputs straddle a range that never even shrinks smaller than 1, no matter how small your input range. This perspective of shrinking an input range around the limiting point, and seeing whether or not you’re restricted in how much that shrinks the output range, leads to something called the “epsilon delta” definition of limits. You could argue this needlessly heavy-duty for an introduction to calculus. Like I said, if you know what the word “approach” means, you know what a limit means, so there’s nothing new on the conceptual level here. But this is an interesting glimpse into the field of real analysis, and it gives you a taste for how mathematicians made the intuitive ideas of calculus fully airtight and rigorous. You’ve already seen the main idea: when a limit exists, you can make this output range as small as you want; but when the limit doesn’t exist, that output range can’t get smaller than some value, no matter how much you shrink the input range around the limiting input. Phrasing that same idea a little more precisely, maybe in the context of this example where the limiting value was 12, think of any distance away from 12, where for some reason it’s common to use the greek letter “epsilon” to denote that distance. And the intent here is that that distance be something as small as you want. What it means for the limit to exist is that you can always find a range of inputs around our limiting input, some distance delta away from 0, so that any input within a distance delta of 0 corresponds to an output with a distance epsilon of 12. They key point is that this is true for any epsilon, no matter how small. In contrast, when a limit doesn’t exist, as in this example, you can find a sufficiently small epsilon, like 0.4, so that no matter how small you make your range around 0, no matter how tiny delta is, the corresponding range of outputs is just always too big. There is no limiting output value that they get arbitrarily close to. So far this is all pretty theory heavy; limits being used to formally define the derivative, then epsilons and deltas being used to rigorously define limits themselves. So let’s finish things off here with a trick for actually computing limits. For example, let’s say for some reason you were studying the function sin(pi*x)/(x2-1). Maybe this models some kind of dampened oscillation. When you plot a bunch of points to graph it, it looks pretty continuous, but there’s a problematic value, x=1. When you plug that in, sin(pi) is 0, and the denominator is also 0, so the function is actually not defined there, and the graph should really have a hole there. This also happens at -1, but let’s just focus our attention on one of these holes for now. The graph certainly does seem to approach some distinct value at that point, wouldn’t you say? So you might ask, how do you figure out what output this approaches as x approaches 1, since you can’t just plug in 1? Well, one way to approximate it would be to plug in a number very close to 1, like 1.00001. Doing that, you’d get a number around -1.57. But is there a way to know exactly what it is? Some systematic process to take an expression like this one, which looks like 0/0 at some input, and ask what its limit is as x approaches that input? Well, after limits so helpfully let us write the definition for a derivative, derivatives can come back to return the favor and help us evaluate limits. Let me show you what I mean. Here’s the graph of sin(pi*x), and here’s the graph of x2-1. That’s kind of a lot on screen, but just focus on what’s happening at x=1. The point here is that sin(pi*x) and x2-1 are both 0 at that point, so they cross the x-axis. In the same spirit as plugging in a specific value near 1, like 1.00001, let’s zoom in on that point and consider what happens a tiny nudge dx away. The value of sin(pi*x) is bumped down, and the value of that nudge, which was caused by the nudge dx to the input, is what we might call d(sin(pi*x)). From our knowledge of derivatives, using the chain rule, that should be around cos(pi*x)*pi*dx. Since the starting value was x=1, we plug in x=1 to this expression. In other words, the size of the change to this sin(pi*x) graph is roughly proportional to dx, with proportionality constant cos(pi)*pi. Since cos(pi) is exactly -1, we can write that as -pi*dx. Similarly, the value this x2-1 graph has changed by some d(x2-1). And taking the derivative, the size of that nudge should be 2*x*dx. Again, since we started at x=1, that means the size of this change is about 2*1*dx. So for values of x which are some tiny value dx away from 1, the ratio sin(pi*x)/(x2-1) is approximately (-pi*dx) / (2*dx). The dx’s cancel, so that value is -pi/2. Since these approximations get more and more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dx, this ratio -pi/2 actually tells us the precise limiting value as x approaches 1. Remember, what that means is that the limiting height on our original graph is evidently exactly -pi/2. What happened there is a little subtle, so let me show it again, but this time a little more generally. Instead of these two specific functions, which both equal 0 at x=1, think of any two functions f(x) and g(x), which are both 0 at some common value x = a. And these have to be functions where you’re able to take a derivative of them at x = a, meaning they each basically look like a line when you zoom in close enough to that value. Even though you can’t compute f divided by g at the trouble point, since both equal zero, you can ask abou this ratio for values of x very close to a, the limit as x approach a. And it’s helpful to think of those nearby inputs as a tiny nudge dx away from a. The value of f at that nudged point is approximately its derivative, df/dx evaluated at a, times dx. Likewise the the value of g at that nudged point is approximately the derivative of g, evaluated at a, times dx. So near this trouble point, the ratio between the outputs of f and g is actually about the same as the derivative of f at a, times dx, divided by the derivative of g at a, times dx. These dx’s cancel, so the ratio of f and g near a is about the same as the ratio between their derivatives. Since those approximations get more accurate for smaller nudges, this ratio of derivatives gives the precise value for the limit. This is a really handy trick for computing a lot of limits. If you come across an expression that seems to equal 0/0 when you plug in some input, just take the derivative of the top and bottom expressions, and plug in that trouble input. This clever trick is called “L'Hôpital's rule”. Interestingly, it was actually discovered by Johann Bernoulli, but L’Hopital was a wealthy dude who essentially paid Bernoulli for the rights to some of his mathematical discoveries. In a very literal way, it pays to understand these tiny nudges. You might remember that the definition of a derivative for any given function comes down to computing the limit of a fraction that looks like 0/0, so you might think L’Hopital’s rule gives a handy way to discover new derivative formulas. But that would be cheating, since presumably you don’t yet know what the derivative on the numerator here is. When it comes to discovering derivative formulas, something we’ve been doing a fair amount this series, there is no systematic plug-and-chug method. But that’s a good thing. When creativity is required to solve problems like these, it’s a good sign you’re doing something real; something that might give you a powerful tool to solve future problems. Up next, I’ll talk about what an integral is, as well as the fundamental theorem of calculus, which is another example of where limits are used to help give a clear meaning to a fairly delicate idea that flirts with infinity. As you know, most support for this channel comes through Patreon, and the primary perk for patrons is early access to future series like this, where the next one will be on Probability. But for those of you who want a more tangible way to flag that you’re part of the community, there is also a small 3blue1brown store, links on the screen and in the description. I’m still debating whether or to make a preliminary batch of plushie pi creatures, it kind of depends on how many viewers seem interested in the store in general, but let me know in comments what kind of other things you’d like to see there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0	3Blue1Brown	video	This guy, Grothendieck, is somewhat of a mathematical idol to me. And I just love this quote, don’t you? Too often in math we just dive into showing that a certain fact is true with long series of formulas before stepping back and making sure that it feels reasonable, and preferably obvious, at least on an intuitive level. In this video I want to talk about integrals, and the thing that I want to become “almost obvious” is that they are an inverse of derivatives. Here, we’ll focus just on one example, which is kind of dual to the example of a moving car that I talked about in chapter 2 of the series, introducing derivatives. Then in the next video, we’ll see how the idea generalizes into some other contexts. Imagine you’re sitting in a car, and you can’t see out the window; all you see is the speedometer. At some point, the car starts moving, speeds up, then slows back down to a stop, all over 8 seconds. The question is, is there a nice way to figure out how far you’ve traveled during that time, based only on your view of the speedometer? Or better yet, find a distance function s(t) that tells you how far you’ve traveled after any given amount of time, t, between 0 and 8 seconds. Let’s say you take note of the velocity at each second, and make a plot over time like this... And maybe you find that a nice function to model your velocity over time, in meters per second, is v(t) = t(8-t). You might remember, in chapter 2 of this series, we were looking at the opposite situation, where you know a distance function, s(t), and you want to figure out a velocity function from that. I showed how the derivative of your distance vs. time function gives you a velocity vs. time function, so in our current situation, where all we know is the velocity function, it should make sense that finding a distance vs. time function s(t) comes down to asking what function has a derivative t(8-t). This is often described as finding the anti-derivative of a function. And indeed, that’s what we’ll end up doing, and you could even pause and try that right now. But first, I want to spend the bulk of this video showing how this question is related to finding an area bounded by velocity graph, because that helps to build an intuition for a whole class of what are called “integral problems” in math and science. This question would be much simpler if the car was moving with a constant velocity, right? In that case, you could just multiply the velocity, in meters per second, by the amount of time passed, in seconds, and that gives you the number of meters traveled. Notice that you can visualize that distance as an area, and if visualizing distance as an area seems weird, I’m right there with you. It’s just that on this plot, where the horizontal direction has units of seconds and the vertical direction has units of meters/second, units of area very naturally correspond to meters. But what makes our situation hard is that the velocity not constant, it’s incessantly changing at every instant. It would even be a lot easier if it only ever changed at a handful of points, maybe staying static for the first second, then suddenly discontinuously jumping to a constant 7 meters per second for the next second, and so on, with discontinuous jumps to portions of constant velocity. That might make it very uncomfortable for the driver, in fact, it’s physically impossible, but it would make your calculations a lot more straightforward. You could compute the distance traveled on each interval by multiplying the constant velocity on that interval by the change in time. Then just add them all up. So what we’ll do is just approximate our velocity function as if it was constant on a bunch of different intervals. Then, as is common in calculus, we’ll see how refining that approximation leads us to something precise. Here, let’s make this more concrete with some numbers. Chop up the time axis between 0 and 8 into many small intervals, each with some little width dt, like 0.25 seconds. Consider one of these intervals, like the one between t=1, and 1.25. In reality the car speeds up from 7 m/s to about 8.4 m/s during that time, which you can find by plugging in t = 1 and 1.25 to the equation for velocity. We want to approximate the car’s motion as if its velocity was constant on this interval. Again, the reason for doing that is that we don’t really know how to handle anything other than a constant velocity situations. You could choose this constant to be anything between 7 and 8.4, it doesn’t really matter. All that matters is that that our sequence of approximations, whatever they are, gets better and better as dt gets smaller and smaller. That treating this car’s journey as a bunch of discontinuous jumps in speed between small portions of constant velocity becomes a less wrong reflection of reality as we decrease the time between those jumps. So for convenience, let’s just approximate the speed on each interval with whatever the true car’s velocity is at the start of the interval; the height of the graph above the left side, which in this case is 7. So on this example interval, according to our approximation, the car moves (7 m/s)*(0.25 s). That’s 1.75 meters, nicely visualized as the area of this thin rectangle. This is a little under the real distance traveled, but not by much. And the same goes for every other interval: The approximated distance is v(t)*dt, it’s just that you plug in a different value of t for each one, giving a different height for each rectangle. I’m going to write out an expression for the sum of the areas of all these rectangles in kind of a funny way. Take this symbol, which looks like a stretched “S” for sum, then put a 0 at its bottom and an 8 at its top to indicate that we’re ranging over time steps between 0 and 8 seconds. And as I said the amount we’re adding up at each time step is v(t)*dt. Two things are implicit in this notation: First, the value dt plays two roles: not only is it a factor in each quantity we’re adding up, it also indicates the spacing between each sampled time step. So when you make dt smaller, even though it decreases the area of each rectangle here, it increases the total number of rectangles whose areas we’re adding up. And second, the reason we don’t use the usual sigma notation to indicate a sum is that this expression is technically not any particular sum for any particular choice of dt; it’s whatever that sum approaches as dt approaches 0. As you can see, what that approaches is the area bounded by this curve and the horizontal axis. Remember, smaller choices of dt indicate closer approximations for our original question, how far does the car go, right? So this limiting value for the sum, the area under this curve, gives the precise answer to the question, in full unapproximated precision. Now tell me that’s not surprising. We have this pretty complicated idea of approximations that can involve adding up a huge number of very tiny things, and yet the value those approximates approach can be described so simply, as the area under a curve. This expression is called an “integral” of v(t), since it brings all of its values together, it integrates them. Now you could say, “How does this help!?. You’ve just reframed one hard question, finding how far the car has traveled, into another equally hard problem, finding the area between this graph and the horizontal axis?” And...you’d be right! If the velocity/distance duo was all we cared about, most of this video with all this area under a curve nonsense would be a waste of time. We could just skip straight ahead to figuring out an antiderivative. But finding the area between a function’s graph and the horizontal axis is somewhat of a common language for many disparate problems that can be broken down and approximated as the sum of a large number of small things. You’ll see more next video, but for now I’ll just say in the abstract that understanding how interpret and compute the area under a graph is a very general problem-solving tool. In fact, the first video of this series already covered the basics of how this works, but now that we have more of a background with derivatives, we can actually take the idea to its completion. For our velocity example, think of this right endpoint as a variable, capital T. So we’re thinking of this integral of the velocity function between 0 and T, the area under this curve between those two inputs, as a function, where that upper bound is the variable. That area represents the distance the car has traveled after T seconds, right? So this is really a distance vs. time function s(T). Now ask yourself: What is the derivative of that function? On the one hand, a tiny change in distance over a tiny change in time is velocity; that’s what velocity means. But there’s another way to see it purely in terms of this graph and this area, which generalizes better to other integral problems. A slight nudge of dT to the input causes that area to increase, some little ds represented by the area of this sliver. The height of that sliver is the height of the graph at that point, v(T), and its width is dT. And for small enough dT, we can basically consider that sliver to be a rectangle. So the area of that sliver, ds, is approximately equal to v(T)*dT. Because this approximation gets better and better for smaller dT, the derivative of the area function ds/dT at this point equals v(T), the value of the velocity function at whatever time we started on. And that’s super general, the derivative of any function giving the area under a graph like this is equal to the function for the graph itself. So if our velocity function here is t*(8-t), what should s be? What function of t has a derivative t*(8-t). This is where we actually have to roll up our sleeves and do some math. It’s easier to see if we expand this out as 8t - t2. Take each part here one at a time: What function has a derivative 8t? Well, we know that the derivative of t2 is 2t, so if we just scale that up by 4, we see that the derivative of 4t2 is 8t. And for that second part, what kind of function might have -t2 as its derivative? Using the power rule again, we know that the derivative of a cubic term, t3, gives a squared term, 3t2, so if we scale that down by a third, the derivative of (⅓)t3 is exactly t2, and making that negative we see that -(⅓)t3 has a derivative of -t2. Therefore, the antiderivative of 8t - t2 is 4t2 - (⅓)t3. But there’s a slight issue here: we could add any constant to this function, and its derivative would still be 8t - t2. The derivative of a constant is always 0. And if we graph s(t), you can think of this in the sense that moving a graph of a distance function up and down does nothing to affect its slope above each input. So there are actually infinitely many different possible antiderivative functions, all of which look like 4t2 - (⅓)t3 + C for some constant C. But there is one piece of information we haven’t used yet that let’s us zero in on which antiderivative to use: The lower bound on the integral. This integral must be zero when we drag that right endpoint all the way to the left endpoint, right? The distance traveled by the car between 0 seconds and 0 seconds is...zero. So as we found, this area as a function of capital T is an antiderivative for the stuff inside, and to choose what constant to add, subtract off the value of that antiderivative function at the lower bound. If you think about it for a moment, that ensures that the integral from the lower bound to itself will indeed be 0. As it so happens, when you evaluate the function we have here at t=0, you get zero, so in this specific case you don’t actually need to subtract off anything. For example, the total distance traveled during the 8 seconds is this expression evaluated at T=8, which is 85.33, minus 0. But a more typical example would be something like this integral between 1 and 7. That’s the area pictured here, and it represents the distance traveled between 1 second and 7 seconds. What you’d do is evaluate the antiderivative we found at the top bound, 7, and subtract off its value at the bottom bound, 1. Notice, it doesn’t matter what antiderivative we choose here; if for some reason it had a constant added to it, like 5, that constant would cancel out. More generally, anytime you want to integrate some function –and remember you think of as adding up the values f(x)*dx for inputs in a certain range then asking what that sum approaches as dx approaches 0– the first step is to find an antiderivative, some other function, “capital F(x)”, whose derivative is the thing inside the integral. Then the integral equals this antiderivative evaluated at the top bound, minus its value at the bottom bound. This fact is called the “fundamental theorem of calculus”. Here’s what’s crazy about this fact: The integral, the limiting value for the sum of all these thin rectangles, takes into account every single input on the continuum from the lower bound to the upper bound, that’s why we use the word “integrate”; it brings them together. And yet, to actually compute it using the antiderivative, you look at only two inputs: the top and the bottom. It almost feels like cheating! Finding the antiderivative implicitly accounts for all the information needed to add up all the values between the lower bound and upper bound. There’s kind of a lot packed into this whole concept, so let’s recap everything that just happened, shall we? We wanted to figure out how far a car goes just by looking at the speedometer, and what makes that hard is that the velocity was always changing. If you approximate it to be constant on multiple different intervals, you can figure out how far the car goes on each interval just with multiplication, then add them all up. Adding up those products can be visualized as the sum of the areas of many thin rectangles like this. Better and better approximations of the original problem correspond to collections of rectangles whose aggregate area is closer and closer to being the area under this curve between the start time and end time, so that area under the curve is the precise distance traveled for the true, nowhere-constant velocity function. If you think of this area as function, with a variable right end point, you can deduce that the derivative of that area function must equal the height of the graph at each point. That’s the key! So to find a function giving this area, you ask what function has v(t) as its derivative. There are actually infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function, since you can always just add some constant without affecting the derivative, so you account for that by subtracting off the value of whatever antiderivative function you choose at the bottom bound. By the way, one important thing to bring up before leaving is the idea of negative area. What if our velocity function was negative at some point? Meaning the car is going backwards. It’s still true that the tiny distance traveled ds on a little time interval is about equal to the velocity times the tiny change in time, it’s just that that the number you’d plug in for velocity would be negative, so that tiny change in distance is negative. In terms of our thin rectangles, if the rectangle goes below the horizontal axis like this, its area represents a bit of distance traveled backwards, so if what you want is to find the distance between the car’s start point and end point, you’d want to subtract it. And this is generally true of integrals: Whenever a graph dips below the horizontal axis, that area underneath is counted as negative. What you’ll commonly hear is that integrals measure the “signed” area between a graph and the horizontal axis. Next up I’ll bring up more contexts where this idea of an integral and the area under curves comes up, along with some other intuitions for the fundamental theorem of calculus. Perhaps you remember, chapter 2 of this series, introducing the derivative was sponsored by the Art of Problem Solving. So I think there’s something elegant to the fact that this video, which is kind of a dual to that one, was also supported in part by the Art of Problem Solving. I really can’t imagine a better sponsor for the channel, because it’s a company whose books and courses I recommend to people anyway. They were highly influential to me, when I was a student developing a love for creative math, so if you’re a parent looking to foster your own child’s love for the subject, or if you’re a student who wants to see what math has to offer beyond rote school work, I cannot recommend the Art of Problem Solving enough. Whether that’s their newest development to build the right intuitions in elementary schools kids, called Beast academy, or their courses on higher level topics and contest preparation. Going to AoPS.com/3blue1brown, or clicking the link on the screen, lets them know you came from this channel, which may encourage them to support future projects like this one. I consider these videos a success not when they teach people a particular bit of math, which can only ever be a drop in the ocean, but when they encourage people to go explore the expanse of math for themselves. And the Art of Problem Solving is among the few great places to actually do that.

This is a useful thing to know in its own right, but what’s really neat is that it gives a completely different perspective for why integrals and derivatives are inverses of one and other. Take a look at the graph of sin(x) between 0 and pi, which is half its period. What is the average height of this graph on that interval? It’s not a useless question. All sorts of cyclic phenomena in the world are modeled with sine waves: For example, the number of hours the sun is up per day as a function of which-day-of-the-year-it-is follows a sine wave pattern. So if you wanted to predict, say, the average effectiveness of solar panels in summer months vs. winter months, you’d want to be able to answer a question like this: What’s the average value of that sine function over half its period. Whereas a case like that will have all sorts of constants mucking up the function, we’ll just focus on a pure unencumbered sin(x) function, but the substance of the approach would be the same in any application. It’s kind of a weird thing to think about, isn’t it, the average of a continuous variable. Usually, with averages, we think of a finite number of values, where you add all them up and divide that sum by how many values there are. But there are infinitely many values of sin(x) between 0 and pi, and its not like we can add all those numbers and divide by infinity. This sensation actually comes up a lot in math, and is worth remembering, where you have this vague sense that you want to add together infinitely many values associated with a continuum like this, even though that doesn’t really make sense. Almost always, when you get this sense, the key will be to use an integral somehow. And to think through exactly how, a good first step is usually to approximate your situation with some kind of finite sum. In this case, imagine sampling a finite number of points, evenly spaced in this range. Since it’s a finite sample, you can find the average by adding up all the heights, sin(x), at each one, and divide that sum by the number of points you sampled, right? And presumably, if the idea of an average height among all infinitely many points is going to make any sense at all, the more points we sample, which would involve adding up more heights, the closer the average of that sample should be to the actual average of the continuous variable, don’t you think? This should feel at least somewhat related to taking an integral of sin(x) between 0 and pi, even if it might not be clear at first exactly how the two ideas will match up. For that integral, you also think of a sample of inputs on this continuum, but instead of adding the height sin(x) at each one, and dividing by how many there are, you add up sin(x)*dx where dx is the spacing between the samples; that is, you’re adding little areas, not heights. Technically, the integral is not quite this sum, it’s whatever that sum approaches as dx approaches 0. But it’s helpful to reason with respect to one of these finite iterations, where you’re adding the areas of some specific number of rectangles. So what you want to do is reframe this expression for the average, this sum of the heights divided by the number of sampled points, in terms of dx, the spacing between samples. If I tell you that the spacing between these points is 0.1, for example, and you know that they range from 0 to pi, can you tell me how many there are? Well, you can take that length of the interval, pi, and divide it by the length of the space between each sample. If it doesn’t go in evenly, you’d round down to the nearest integer, but as an approximation this is fine. So if we write the spacing between samples as dx, the number of samples is pi/dx. So replacing the denominator with pi/dx here, you can rearrange, putting the dx up top and distributing. But, think about what it means to distribute that dx up top; it means the terms you’re adding all look like sin(x)*dx for the various inputs x that you’re sampling, so that numerator looks exactly like an integral expression. And for larger and larger samples of points, the average approaches the actual integral of sin(x) between 0 and pi, all divided by the length of that range, pi. In other words, the average height of this graph is this area divided by its width. On an intuitive level, and just thinking in terms of units, that feels pretty reasonable, doesn’t it? Area divided by with gives you average height. So let’s actually compute this expression. As we saw, last video, to compute an integral you need to find an antiderivative of the function inside the integral; some function whose derivative is sin(x) And, if you’re comfortable with trig derivatives, you know the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so if you negate that, -cos(x) is the antiderivative of sin(x). To gut check yourself on that, look at this graph of -cos(x). At 0, the slope is 0, then it increases to some maximum slope at pi/2, then it goes back down to 0 at pi, and in general its slope does indeed seem to match the height of the sine graph. To evaluate the integral of sin(x) between 0 and pi, take that antiderivative at the upper bound, and subtract its value at the lower bound. More visually, that’s the difference in the height of this -cos(x) graph above pi, and its height at 0, and as you can see, that change in height is exactly 2. That’s kind of interesting, isn’t it? That the area under this sine graph turns out to be exactly 2. So the answer to our average height problem, this integral divided by the width of the region, evidently turns out to be 2/pi, which is around 0.64. I promised at the start that this question of finding the average value of a function offers an alternate perspective on on why integrals and derivatives are inverses of one and other; why the area under one graph is related to the slope of another. Notice how finding this average value 2/pi came down to looking at the change in the antiderivative -cos(x) over the input range, divided by the length of that input range. Another way to think about that fraction is as the rise-over-run slope between the point of the antiderivative graph below zero, and the point of that graph above pi. Now think about why it might make sense that this slope represents the average value of sin(x) on that region. By definition, sin(x) is the derivative of this antiderivative graph; it gives the slope of -cos(x) at every input. So another way to think about the average value sin(x) is as the average slope over all tangent lines here between 0 and pi. And from that view, doesn’t it make a lot of sense that the average slope of a graph over all its point in a certain range should equal the total slope between the start and end point? To digest this idea, it helps to see what it looks like for a general function. For any function f(x), if you want to find its average value on some interval, say between a and b, what you do is take the integral of f on that interval, divided by the width of the interval. You can think of this as taking the area under the graph divided by the width. Or more accurately, it’s the signed area of that graph, since area below the x-axis is counted as negative. And take a moment to remember the connection between this idea of a continuous average and the usual finite notion of an average, where you add up many numbers and divide by how many there are. When you take some sample of points spaced out by dx, the number of samples is about the length of the interval divided by dx. So if you add up the value of f(x) at each sample and divide by the total number of samples, it’s the same as adding up the products f(x)*dx and dividing by the width of the entire interval. The only difference between that and the integral expression is that the integral asks what happens as dx approaches 0, but that just corresponds with samples of more and more points that approximate the true average increasingly well. Like any integral, evaluating this comes down to finding an antiderivative of f(x), commonly denoted capital F(x). In particular, what we want is the change to this antiderivative between a and b, F(b) - F(a), which you can think of as the change in the height of this new graph between the two bounds. I’ve conveniently chosen an antiderivative which passes through 0 at the lower bound here, but keep in mind that you could freely shift this up and down, adding whatever constant you want to it, and it would still be a valid antiderivative. So the solution to the average problem is the change in the height of this new graph divided by the change to its x value between a and b. In other words, it’s the slope of the antiderivative graph between these endpoints. And again, that should make a lot of sense, because little f(x) gives the slope of a tangent line to this graph at each point, after all it is by definition the derivative of capital F. So, why are antiderivative the key to solving integrals? Well, my favorite intuition is still the one I showed last video, but a second perspective is that when you reframe the question of finding the average of a continuous value as finding the average slope of bunch of tangent lines, it lets you see the answer just by the comparing endpoints, rather than having to actually tally up all points in between. In the last video, I described a sensation that should bring integrals to your mind. Namely, if you feel like the problem you’re solving could be approximated by breaking it up somehow, and adding up a large number of small things. Here I want you to come away recognizing a second sensation that should bring integrals to your mind. If there’s some idea that you understand in a finite context, and which involves adding up multiple values, like taking the average of a bunch of numbers, and if you want to generalize that idea to apply to an infinite continuous range of values, try seeing if you can phrase things in terms of an integral. It’s a feeling that comes up enough that’s it’s definitely worth remembering. My thanks, as always, to those making these videos possible.

And, if you’re already comfortable with second derivatives, third derivatives and such, great! Feel free to skip right ahead to the main event now, you won’t hurt my feelings. But somehow I’ve managed not to bring up higher order derivatives at all so far this series, so for the sake of completeness, I thought I’d give this little footnote to very briefly go over them. I’ll focus mainly on the second derivative, showing what it looks like in the context of graphs and motion, and leave you to think about the analogies for higher orders. Given some function f(x), the derivative can be interpreted as the slope of its graph above some input, right? A steep slope means a high value for the derivative, a downward slope means a negative derivative. The second derivative, whose notation I’ll explain in a moment, is the derivative of the derivative, meaning it tells you how that slope is changing. The way to see this at a glance is to think of how the graph of f(x) curves. At points where it curves upward, the slope is increasing, so the second derivative is positive. At points where it curves downward, the slope is decreasing, so the second derivative is negative. For example, a graph like this has a very positive second derivative at the input 4, since the slope is rapidly increasing around that point, whereas a graph like this still has a positive second derivative at that same point, but it’s smaller, since the slope is increasing only slowly. At points where there’s not really any curvature, the second derivative is zero. As far as notation goes, you could try writing it like this, indicating some small change to the derivative function divided by some small change to x, where as always the use of that letter d suggests that you really want to consider what this ratio approach as dx, both dx’s in this case, approach 0. That’s pretty awkward and clunky, so the standard is to abbreviate it as d2f/dx2. It’s not terribly important for getting an intuition of the second derivative, but perhaps it’s worth showing how you can read this notation. Think of starting at some input to your function, and taking two small steps to the right, each with a size dx. I’m choosing rather big steps here so that we’ll better see what’s going on, but in principle think of them as rather tiny. The first step causes some change to the function, which I’ll call df1, and the second step causes some similar, but possibly slightly different change, which I’ll call df2. The difference between these; the change in how the function changes, is what we’ll call d(df). You should think of this as really small, typically proportional to the size of (dx)2. So if your choice for dx was 0.01, you’d expect this d(df) to be proportional to 0.001. And the second derivative is the size of this change to the change, divide by the size of (dx)2. Or, more precisely, it’s whatever that ratio approaches as dx approaches 0. Even though it’s not like the letter d is a variable being multiplied by f, for the sake of more compact notation you write this as d2f/dx2, and you don’t bother with any parentheses on the bottom. Maybe the most visceral understanding of the second derivative is that it represents acceleration. Given some movement along a line, suppose you have some function that records distance traveled vs. time, and maybe its graph looks something like this, steadily increasing over time. Then its derivative tells you velocity at each point in time, right? For the example, the graph might look like this bump, increasing to some maximum, then decreasing back to 0. So its second derivative tells you the rate of change for velocity, the acceleration at each point in time. In the example, the second derivative is positive for the first half of the journey, which indicates indicates speeding up. That’s sensation of being pushed back into your car seat with a constant force. Or rather, having the car seat push you with a constant force. A negative second derivative indicates slowing down, negative acceleration. The third derivative, and this is not a joke, is called jerk. So if the jerk is not zero, it means the strength of the acceleration itself is changing. One of the most useful things about higher order derivatives is how they help in approximating functions, which is the topic of the next chapter on Taylor series, so I’ll see you there.
