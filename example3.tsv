limit, which is a super important idea.It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon.But despite being so super important,it's actually a really, really, really, really, really, reallysimple idea.So let me draw a function here, actually,let me define a function here, a kind of a simple function.So let's define f of x, let's say that f of xis going to be x minus 1 over x minus 1.And you might say, hey, Sal look,I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator.If I have something divided by itself,that would just be equal to 1.Can't I just simplify this to f of x equals 1?And I would say, well, you're almost true,the difference between f of x equals 1and this thing right over here, is that this thing can neverequal-- this thing is undefined when x is equal to 1.Because if you set, let me define it.Let me write it over here, if you have f of,sorry not f of 0, if you have f of 1, what happens.In the numerator, we get 1 minus 1,which is, let me just write it down, in the numerator,you get 0.And in the denominator, you get 1 minus 1, which is also 0.And so anything divided by 0, including 0 divided by 0,this is undefined.So you can make the simplification.You can say that this is you the same thing as f of x is equalto 1, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot beequal to 1.Now this and this are equivalent,both of these are going to be equal to 1for all other X's other than one, but at x equals 1,it becomes undefined.This is undefined and this one's undefined.So how would I graph this function.So let me graph it.So that, is my y is equal to f of x axis,y is equal to f of x axis, and then this over hereis my x-axis.And then let's say this is the point x is equal to 1.This over here would be x is equal to negative 1.This is y is equal to 1, right up there I could do negative 1.but that matter much relative to this function right over here.And let me graph it.So it's essentially for any x other than 1 fof x is going to be equal to 1.So it's going to be, look like this.It's going to look like this, except at 1.At 1 f of x is undefined.So I'm going to put a little bit of a gap rightover here, the circle to signify that this function is notdefined.We don't know what this function equals at 1.We never defined it.This definition of the function doesn't tell uswhat to do with 1.It's literally undefined, literally undefinedwhen x is equal to 1.So this is the function right over here.And so once again, if someone were to ask you what is f of 1,you go, and let's say that even though this was a functiondefinition, you'd go, OK x is equal to 1,oh wait there's a gap in my function over here.It is undefined.So let me write it again.It's kind of redundant, but I'll rewrite it f of 1 is undefined.But what if I were to ask you, whatis the function approaching as x equals 1.And now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit.So as x gets closer and closer to 1.So as we get closer and closer x isto 1, what is the function approaching.Well, this entire time, the function,what's a getting closer and closer to.On the left hand side, no matter how closeyou get to 1, as long as you're not at 1,you're actually at f of x is equal to 1.Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing.So you could say, and we'll get more and morefamiliar with this idea as we do more examples,that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit,as x approaches 1 of f of x is equal to, as we get closer,we can get unbelievably, we can get infinitely close to 1,as long as we're not at 1.And our function is going to be equal to 1,it's getting closer and closer and closer to 1.It's actually at 1 the entire time.So in this case, we could say the limitas x approaches 1 of f of x is 1.So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying,look what is a function approachingas x gets closer and closer to 1.Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve,just so that you have the general idea.So let's say that I have the functionf of x, let me just for the sake of variety,let me call it g of x.Let's say that we have g of x is equal to,I could define it this way, we could define it as x squared,when x does not equal, I don't know when x does not equal 2.And let's say that when x equals 2 it is equal to 1.So once again, a kind of an interestingfunction that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous,it has a discontinuity.Let me graph it.So this is my y equals f of x axis,this is my x-axis right over here.Let me draw x equals 2, x, let's say this is x equals 1,this is x equals 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2.And then let me draw, so everywhere except x equals 2,it's equal to x squared.So let me draw it like this.So it's going to be a parabola, looks something like this,let me draw a better version of the parabola.So it'll look something like this.Not the most beautifully drawn parabolain the history of drawing parabolas,but I think it'll give you the idea.I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully.It should be symmetric, let me redraw itbecause that's kind of ugly.And that's looking better.OK, all right, there you go.All right, now, this would be the graph of just x squared.But this can't be.It's not x squared when x is equal to 2.So once again, when x is equal to 2,we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here.So I'll draw a gap right over there, because when x equals 2the function is equal to 1.When x is equal to 2, so let's say that,and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that.So this, on the graph of f of x is equal to x squared,this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1,this would be 3.So when x is equal to 2, our function is equal to 1.So this is a bit of a bizarre function,but we can define it this way.You can define a function however you like to define it.And so notice, it's just like the graph of fof x is equal to x squared, except when you get to 2,it has this gap, because you don'tuse the f of x is equal to x squared when x is equal to 2.You use f of x-- or I should say gof x-- you use g of x is equal to 1.Have I been saying f of x?I apologize for that.You use g of x is equal to 1.So then then at 2, just at 2, just exactly at 2,it drops down to 1.And then it keeps going along the functiong of x is equal to, or I should say, along the functionx squared.So my question to you.So there's a couple of things, if Iwere to just evaluate the function g of 2.Well, you'd look at this definition,OK, when x equals 2, I use this situation right over here.And it tells me, it's going to be equal to 1.Let me ask a more interesting question.Or perhaps a more interesting question.What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g of x.Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking somethingpretty, pretty, pretty simple.It's saying as x gets closer and closer to 2, as you get closerand closer, and this isn't a rigorous definition,we'll do that in future videos.As x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g of x approaching?So if you get to 1.9, and then 1.999, and then 1.999999,and then 1.9999999, what is g of x approaching.Or if you were to go from the positive direction.If you were to say 2.1, what's g of 2.1,what's g of 2.01, what's g of 2.001, what is that approachingas we get closer and closer to it.And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph.As g gets closer and closer to 2,and if we were to follow along the graph,we see that we are approaching 4.Even though that's not where the function is,the function drops down to 1.The limit of g of x as x approaches 2 is equal to 4.And you could even do this numerically using a calculator,and let me do that, because I think that will be interesting.So let me get the calculator out,let me get my trusty TI-85 out.So here is my calculator, and you could numericallysay, OK, what's it going to approachas you approach x equals 2.So let's try 1.94, for x is equal to 1.9,you would use this top clause right over here.So you'd have 1.9 squared.And so you get 3.61, well what if you get even closer to 2,so 1.99, and once again, let me square that.Well now I'm at 3.96.What if I do 1.999, and I square that?I'm going to have 3.996.Notice I'm going closer, and closer,and closer to our point.And if I did, if I got really close,1.9999999999 squared, what am I going to get to.It's not actually going to be exactly 4,this calculator just rounded things up,but going to get to a number really, really, really, really,really, really, really, really, really close to 4.And we can do something from the positive direction too.And it actually has to be the same numberwhen we approach from the below what we're trying to approach,and above what we're trying to approach.So if we try to 2.1 squared, we get 4.4.If we do 2.let me go a couple of steps ahead,2.01, so this is much closer to 2 now, squared.Now we are getting much closer to 4.So the closer we get to 2, the closerit seems like we're getting to 4.So once again, that's a numeric wayof saying that the limit, as x approaches 2from either direction of g of x, even though right at 2,the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous.The limit as we're approaching 2,we're getting closer, and closer, and closer to 4.

xright over here and we want to figure outthree different limits and like alwayspause this video and see if you can figure it outon your own before we do it together.Alright now first let's think about what's the limitof f of x it's x approaches six.So as x, I'm gonna do this in a color you can see,as x approaches six from both sideswell as we approach six from the left hand side,from values less than six,it looks like our f of x is approaching oneand as we approach x equals six from the right hand sideit looks like our f of x is once again approaching oneand in order for this limit to exist,we need to be approaching the same valuefrom both the left and the right hand sideand so here at least graphically,so you never are sure with a graph but this isa pretty good estimate, it looks like we are approaching oneright over there, in a darker color.Now let's do this next one.The limit of f of x is x approaches fourso as we approach four from the left hand sidewhat is going on?Well as we approach four from the left hand sideit looks like our function, the value of our functionit looks like it is approaching three.Remember you can have a limit exist at an x valuewhere the function itself is not defined,the function , if you said after four, it's not definedbut it looks like when we approach it from the leftwhen we approach x equals four from the leftit looks like f is approaching threeand then we approach four from the right,once again, it looks like our function is approaching threeso here I would say, at least from what we can tellfrom the graph it looks like the limitof f of x is x approaches four is three,even though the function itself is not defined yet.Now let's think about the limit as x approaches two.So this is interesting the function is defined theref of two is two, let's see when we approachfrom the left hand side it looks like our functionis approaching the value of twobut when we approach from the right hand side,when we approach x equals two from the right hand side,our function is getting closer and closer to fiveit's not quite getting to five but as we go fromyou know 2.1 2.01 2.001 it looks like our functionthe value of our function's getting closer and closerto five and since we are approaching two different valuesfrom the left hand side and the right hand sideas x approached two from the left hand sideand the right hand side we would say that this limitdoes not exist so does not exist.Which is interesting.In this first case the function is defined at sixand the limit is equal to the value of the functionat x equals six, here the function was not definedat x equals four, but the limit does existhere the function is defined at f equals, x equals twobut the limit does not exist as we approach x equals twolet's do another function just to get more casesof looking at graphical limits.So here we have the graph of Y is equal to g of xand once again pause this video and have a go at itand see if you can figure out these limits graphically.So first we have the limit as x approaches fiveg of x so as we approach five from the left hand sideit looks like we are approaching this valuelet me just draw a straight Line that takes usso it looks like we're approaching this valueand as we approach five from the right hand sideit also looks like we are approaching that same value.And so this value, just eye balling it off of herelooks like it's about .4 so I'll say this limitdefinitely exists just when looking at a graphit's not that preciseso I would say it's approximately 0.4it might be 0.41 it might be 0.41456789we don't know exactly just looking at this graphbut it looks like a value roughly around there.Now let's think about the limit of g of xas x approaches seven so let's do the same exercise.What happens as we approach from the leftfrom values less than seven 6.9, 6.99, 6.999well it looks like the value of our functionis approaching two, it doesn't matterthat the actual function is defined g of seven is fivebut as we approach from the left,as x goes 6.9, 6.99 and so on,it looks like our value of our functionis approaching two, and as we approach x equals sevenfrom the right hand side it seems like the same thingis happening it seems like we are approaching twoand so I would say that this is going to be equal to twoand so once again, the function is defined thereand the limit exists there but the g of sevenis different than the value if the limit of g of xas x approaches seven.Now let's do one more.What's the limit as x approaches one.Well we'll do the same thing,from the left hand side, it looks like we're goingunbounded as x goes .9, 0.99, 0.999 and 0.9999it looks like we're just going unbounded towards infinityand as we approach from the right hand sideit looks like the same thing is happeningwe're going unbounded to infinity.So formally, sometimes informally people will sayoh it's approaching infinity or something like thatbut if we wanna be formal about what a limit meansin this context because it is unboundedwe would say that it does not exist.Does not exist.

Graphs are a great tool for understanding this difference.A function is graphed and animated. The x-axis goes from 0 to 3. The graph is a curve that starts at (0, 0.5), moves downward through an open circle at about (2, 0.25). A cursor moves a point on the curve toward the open circle from the left and the right. Values get close to 0.25. At the open circle, the coordinate displays as (2, undefined).

A function is graphed. The x-axis goes from negative 3 to 3. The graph is a U-shaped curve that starts at about (negative 2.5, 4), moves downward to an open circle at (0, 1), moves upward, and ends at about (2.5, 4).
This is the graph of y = x / sin(x). Notice that there's a hole at x = 0 because the function is undefined there.1

value of our function approaching--as we approach x equals 2 from values less than x equals 2.So as you imagine, as we approach x equals 2--So x equals 1, x equals 1.5, x equals 1.9, x equals 1.999,x equals 1.99999999.What is f of x approaching?And we see that f of x seems to be approachingthis value right over here.It seems to be approaching 5.And so the way we would denote that isthe limit of f of x, as x approaches 2--and we're going to specify the direction-- as x approaches 2from the negative direction-- we putthe negative as a superscript after the 2to denote the direction that we're approaching.This is not a negative 2.We're approaching 2 from the negative direction.We're approaching 2 from values less than 2.We're getting closer and closer to 2, but from below-- 1.9,1.99, 1.99999 .As x gets closer and closer from those values,what is f of x approaching?And we see here that it is approaching 5.But what if we were asked the natural other question-- Whatis the limit of f of x as x approaches 2from values greater than 2?So this is a little superscript positive right over here.So now we're going to approach x equals 2,but we're going to approach it from this direction--x equals 3, x equals 2.5, x equals 2.1, x equals 2.01,x equals 2.0001.And we're going to get closer and closer to 2,but we're coming from values that are larger than 2.So here, when x equals 3, f of x is here.When x equals 2.5, f of x is here.When x equals 2.01, f of x looks like it's right over here.So in this situation, we're getting closer and closerto f of x equaling 1.It never does quite equal that.It actually then just has a jump discontinuity.This seems to be the limiting value when we approach whenwe approach 2 from values greater than 2.So this right over here is equal to 1.And so when we think about limits in general,the only way that a limit at 2 will actually existis if both of these one-sided limitsare actually the same thing.In this situation, they aren't.As we approach 2 from values below 2,the function seems to be approaching 5.And as we approach 2 from values above 2,the function seems to be approaching 1.So in this case, the limit-- let me write this down--the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the negative direction, does notequal the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the positive direction.And since this is the case-- that they're not equal--the limit does not exist.The limit as x approaches 2 in generalof f of x-- so the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2,does not exist.In order for it to have existed, these two thingswould have had to have been equal to each other.For example, if someone were to say,what is the limit of f of x as x approaches 4?Well, then we could think about the two one-sided limits--the one-sided limit from below and the one-sided limitfrom above.So we could say, well, let's see.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 4 from below-- solet me draw that.So what we care about-- x equals 4.As x equals 4 from below--So when x equals 3, we're here where f of 3is negative 2. f of 3.5 seems to be right over here.f of 3.9 seems to be right over here. f of 3.999--we're getting closer and closer to our function equalingnegative 5.So the limit as we approach 4 from below--this one-sided limit from the left,we could say-- this is going to be equal to negative 5.And if we were to ask ourselves the limit of fof x, as x approaches 4 from the right,from values larger than 4, well, same exercise.f of 5 gets us here.f of 4.5 seems right around here.f of 4.1 seems right about here. f of 4.01seems right around here.And even f of 4 is actually defined,but we're getting closer and closer to it.And we see, once again, we are approaching 5.Even if f of 4 was not defined on either side,we would be approaching negative 5.So this is also approaching negative 5.And since the limit from the left-hand sideis equal to the limit from the right-hand side,we can say-- so these two things are equal.And because these two things are equal,we know that the limit of f of x, as x approaches 4,is equal to 5.Let's look at a few more examples.So let's ask ourselves the limit of f of x-- now,this is our new f of x depicted here-- as x approaches 8.And let's approach 8 from the left.As x approaches 8 from values less than 8.So what's this going to be equal to?And I encourage you to pause the video to try to figure it outyourself.So x is getting closer and closer to 8.So if x is 7, f of 7 is here.If x is 7.5, f of 7.5 is here.So it looks like our value of f of xis getting closer and closer and closer to 3.So it looks like the limit of f of x, as x approaches 8from the negative side, is equal to 3.What about from the positive side?What about the limit of f of x as xapproaches 8 from the positive directionor from the right side?Well, here we see as x is 9, this is our f of x.As x is 8.5, this is our f of 8.5.It seems like we're approaching f of x equaling 1.So notice, these two limits are different.So the non-one-sided limit, or the two-sided limit,does not exist at f of x or as we approach 8.So let me write that down.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 8--because these two things are not the same value--this does not exist.Let's do one more example.And here they're actually asking us a question.The function f is graphed below.What appears to be the value of the one-sided limit, the limitof f of x-- this is f of x-- as x approaches negative 2from the negative direction?So this is the negative 2 from the negative direction.So we care what happens as x approaches negative 2.We see f of x is actually undefined right over there.But let's see what happens as we approachfrom the negative direction, or as we approachfrom values less than negative 2,or as we approach from the left.As we approach from the left, f of negative 4is right over here.So this is f of negative 4.f of negative 3 is right over here.f of negative 2.5 seems to be right over here.We seem to be getting closer and closerto f of x being equal to 4, at least visually.So I would say that it looks-- at least,graphically-- the limit of f of x, as x approaches 2from the negative direction, is equal to 4.Now, if we also asked ourselves the limitof f of x, as x approaches negative 2from the positive direction, we would get a similar result.Now, we're going to approach from whenx is 0, f of x seems to be right over here.When x is 1, f of x is right over here.When x is negative 1, f of x is there.When x is negative 1.9, f of x seems to be right over here.So once again, we seem to be getting closer and closer to 4.Because the left-handed limit and the right-handed limitare the same value.Because both one-sided limits are approaching the same thing,we can say that the limit of f of x, as x approachesnegative 2-- and this is from both directions.Since from both directions, we get the same limiting value,we can say that the limit exists there.And it is equal to 4.

0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-estimating-limits-from-graphs/v/determining-which-limit-statements-are-true	khanacademy	video	:00So we have a function, f of x, graphed right over here.And then we have a bunch of statementsabout the limit of f of x, as x approaches different values.And what I want to do is figure out which of these statementsare true and which of these are false.So let's look at this first statement.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,is equal to 0.So is this true or false?So let's look at it.So we're talking about as x approaches 1from the positive direction, so for values greater than 1.So as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,what is f of x?Well, when x is, let's say 1 and 1/2, f of x is up here,as x gets closer and closer to 1, f of x stays right at 1.So as x approaches 1 from the positive direction,it looks like the limit of f of x as x approaches 1from the positive direction isn't 0.It looks like it is 1.So this is not true.This would be true if instead of sayingfrom the positive direction, we saidfrom the negative direction.From the negative direction, the value of the functionreally does look like it is approaching 0.For approaching 1 from the negative direction, whenx is right over here, this is f of x.When x is right over here, this is f of x.When x is right over here, this is f of x.And we see that the value of f of xseems to get closer and closer to 0.So this would only be true if theywere approaching from the negative direction.Next question.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 0 from the negative direction,is the same as limit of f of x as x approaches 0from the positive direction.Is this statement true?Well, let's look.Our function, f of x, as we approach 0from the negative direction-- I'musing a new color-- as we approach 0from the negative direction, so right over here,this is our value of f of x.Then as we get closer, this is our value of f of x.As we get even closer, this is our value of f of x.So it seems from the negative directionlike it is approaching positive 1.From the positive direction, when x is greater than 0,let's try it out.So if, say, x is 1/2, this is our f of x.If x is, let's say, 1/4, this is our f of x.If x is just barely larger than 0, this is our f of x.So it also seems to be approachingf of x is equal to 1.So this looks true.They both seem to be approaching the limit of 1.The limit here is 1.So this is absolutely true.Now let's look at this statement.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 0from the negative direction, is equal to 1.Well, we've already thought about that.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 0from the negative direction, we seethat we're getting closer and closer to 1.As x gets closer and closer to 0, f of xgets closer and closer to 1.So this is also true.Limit of f of x, as x approaches 0 exists.Well, it definitely exists.We've already established that it's equal to 1.So that's true.Now the limit of f of x as x approaches 1 exists,is that true?Well, we already saw that when we were approaching 1from the positive direction, the limitseems to be approaching 1.We get when x is 1 and 1/2, f of x is 1.When x is a little bit more than 1, it's 1.So it seems like we're getting closer and closer to 1.So let me write that down.The limit of f of x, as x approaches 1from the positive direction, is equal to 1.And now what's the limit of f of x as x approaches 1from the negative direction?Well, here, this is our f of x.Here, this is our f of x.It seems like our f of x is getting closer and closer to 0,when we approach 1 from values less than 1.So over here it equals 0.So if the limit from the right-hand sideis a different value than the limit from the left-hand side,then the limit does not exist.So this is not true.Now finally, the limit of f of x, as x approaches 1.5,is equal to 1.So right over here.So everything we've been dealing with so far,we've always looked at points of discontinuity,or points where maybe the function isn't quite defined.But here, this is kind of a plain vanilla point.When x is equal to 1.5, that's maybe right over here,this is f of 1.5.That right over there is the point,well, this is the value f of 1.5.We could say f of, we could see that f of 1.5 is equal to 1,that this right here is the point 1.5 comma 1.And if we approach it from the left-hand side,from values less than it, it's 1, the limit seems to be 1.When we approach from the right-hand side,the limit seems to be 1.So this is a pretty straightforward thing.The graph is continuous right there, and so really,if we just substitute at that point,or we just look at the graph, the limitis the value of the function there.You don't have to have a function be undefined in orderto find a limit there.So it is, indeed, the case that the limitof f of x, as x approaches 1.5, is equal to 1.

It's a little higher.Is it 3.5, 4.99? Is it 3.66?4.999; so very close to five.We're only a thousandth away, we're at 3.68.But then at five all of a suddenit looks like we're kind of jumping to 6.37.And once again, I'm making an inference here.I don't, these are just sample pointsof this function, we don't know exactlywhat the function is.But then if we approach five from values greater than five.At six we're at 3.97; at 5.1 we're at 3.84.5.01; 3.7; 5.001;we're at 3.68.So a thousandth below five and a thousandth above fivewe're at 3.68, but then at fiveall of sudden we're at 6.37.So my most reasonable estimatewould be, well it look like we're approaching 3.68.When we're approaching from values less than five.And we're approaching 3.68 from valuesas we approach five from values greater than five.It doesn't matter that the value of five is 6.37.The limit would be 3.68 ora reasonable estimate for the limit would be 3.68.And this is probably the most tempting distractor herebecause if you were to just substitute five;what is g of five?It tells us 6.37, but the limit does nothave to be what the actual function equals at that point.Let me draw what this might look like.So an example of this, so if this is five right over here,At the point five the value of my functionis 6.37, so let's say that this right over hereis 6.37, so that's the valueof my function right over there.So 6.37, but as we approach five,so that's four, actually let me spread out a little bit.This obviously is not drawing to scale.But as we approach five, so if this, that's 6.37;then at four, 3.37 is about hereand it looks like it's approaching 3.68.So 3.68, actually let me draw that.So 3.68 is gonna be roughly that.3.68 is gonna be roughly that.So the graph, the graph might look something like this.We can infer it looks like it's doing something like this.Where it's approaching 3.68 from values less than fiveand values greater than five, but right at five,our value is 6.37.I don't know for sure if this is what the graph look likeonce again, we're just getting some sample points.But this would be a reasonable inference.And so you can see, our limit.We are approaching 3.68, even though the valueof the function is something different.

definedover the real numbers.This table gives select values of F.We have our table here.For these X values, it gives the corresponding F of X.What is a reasonable estimate for the limit of F of Xas X approaches one from the left?So pause this videoand see if you can figure it out on your own.Alright, now let's work through this together.So the first thing that is really important to realizeis when you see this X approaches oneand you see this little negative superscript here,this does not mean approaching negative one,so this does not mean negative one.Sometimes your brain just sees a oneand that little negative sign there,and you're like oh, this must be a weird wayof writing negative one,or you don't even think about it,but it's not saying that.It's saying, this is saying,let me put a little arrow here,this is the limit of F of Xas X approaches one from the left,from the left.So from the left, how do we know that?Well that's what that little negative tells us.It tells us we're approaching onefrom values less than one.If we were approaching one from the right,from values greater than one,that would be a positive sign right over there.So let's think about it.We want the limit as X approaches one from the left,and lucky for us on this table,we have some values of X approaching one from the left.0.9, which is already pretty close to one,then we get even closer to one from the left.Notice, these are all less than one,but they're getting closer and closer to one.And so what we really wanna look atis what does F of X approachas X is getting closer and closer to one,from the left, from the left.And a key realization here is,if we're thinking about general limits,not just from one direction,then we might wanna look atfrom the left and from the right,but they're asking us only from the left,so we should only be looking at these valuesright over here.In fact, we shouldn't even let the value of F of Xat X equal one confuse us.Sometimes and oftentimes,the limit is approaching a different valuethan the value of the function at that point.So let's look at this.At 0.9, F of X is 2.5.When we get even closer to one from the left,we go to 2.1.When we get even closer to one from the left,we're getting even closer to two.So a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches onefrom the left of F of X,it looks like F of X right over hereis approaching two.We don't know for sure,that's why they're saying, what is a reasonable estimate.It might be approaching 2.01or it might be approaching 1.999.On Khan Academy these will often bemultiple choice questions,so you have to pick the most reasonable one,it would not be fair if they gave a 1.999 as a choiceand 2.01,but if you were saying,hey, maybe this was approaching a whole number,then two could be a reasonable estimate right over here.Although it doesn't have to be two,it could be 2.01258,it might be what it is actually approaching.So let's try another example here.Here it does look like there's a reasonable estimatefor the limit as we approach this value from the left.So now, it says the function Fis defined over the real numbers.This table gives select values of F,similar to the last question.What is a reasonable estimate for the limitas X approaches negative two from the left?So this is confusing.You see these two negative signs.This first negative sign tells uswe're approaching negative two.We wanna say, what happens we're approaching negative two,and we're gonna approach once again from the left.So lucky for us, they have values of Xthat are approaching negative two from the left,so this is X approaches negative two from the left,so that is happening right over here.So that's these values.So notice, this is negative 2.05,then we get even closer, negative 2.01,then we get even closer, negative 2.002,and these are from the leftbecause these are values less than negative two,but they're getting closer and closer to negative two.And so let's see,when we're a little bit further, F of X is negative 20,we get a little bit closer, it's negative 100,we get even a little bit closer, it goes to negative 500.So it would be reasonable, and we don't know for sure,this is just giving us a few sample pointsfor this function,but if we follow this trend,as we get closer and closer to negative two,without getting there,it looks like this is getting unbounded.It looks like it's becoming infinitely negative.And so technically, it looks like this is,I would write this is unbounded,and so if this was a multiple choice question,technically you would say the limitas X approaches negative two from the left does not exist,does not exist.If someone asked the other question,if they said, what is the limitas X approaches negative twofrom the right of F of X,well then you would say,alright, well here are values approaching negative twofrom the right,so this is X approaching negative two from the right,right over here.And remember, when you're looking at a limit,sometimes it might be distractingto look at the actual value of the function at that point,so we wanna think about what is the valueof the function approaching,as your X is approaching that value,as X is approaching, in this case, negative two,from the right.So as we're getting closer and closerto negative two from values larger than negative two,it looks like F of X is getting closer and closerto negative four,which is F of negative two,but that actually seems like a reasonable estimate.Once again, we don't know absolutely for sure,just by sampling some points,but this would be a reasonable estimate.And in general, if you are approaching different valuesfrom the left than from the right,then you would say, a that point,the limit of your function does not exist,and we have seen that in other videos.

0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-formal-definition-of-limits-epsilon-delta/v/building-the-idea-of-epsilon-delta-definition	khanacademy	video	:00Let's try to come up with a mathematically rigorousdefinition for what this statement means.The statement that the limit of fof x as x approaches c is equal to L. So let'ssay that this means that you can get f of x as closeto L as you want.I'll put that in quotes right over here,because it's kind of a little looseygoosey as how close is that.But as close as you want by gettingx sufficiently close to c.So another way of saying this is, if you tell me, hey,I want to get my f of x to be within 0.5 of this limit.Then you're telling me if this limit is actually true,you should be able to hand me a value around c.That if x is within that range, then f of xis definitely going to be as close to L as I desire.So let me draw that out to make it a little bit clearer.And I'm going to zoom in.I'm going to draw another diagram.So let's say that this right over here is my y-axis.And I'm going to zoom in.I'm going to draw a slightly different function, just so wecan really focus on what's going on around here.The range is around c, and the range is around L. So that's x.This right over here is y.Let's say that this is c.And let's just zoom in on our function.So let's say our function looks, is doing something like,let's say it does something like, let's see, Idon't want it to be defined at c.At least just for the-- it could be.You can always find a limit even where is defined.But let's say our function looks something like that.And it can have a little kink in it, the way I drew it.So it looks something like this.It's undefined.Let me draw it a little bit different.So it is undefined when x is equal to c.So this is the point where there's a hole.It is undefined when x is equal to c.So it even has a little kink in it, just like that.And what we want to do is prove that the limit,as x, the limit of f of x-- and let me make it clear,this is the graph of y is equal to fof x-- we want to get an idea for what this definition issaying.If we're claiming that the limit of f of x, as x approaches c,is L.So conceptually, we get the gist already.We already get the gist that this right over here is L.But what is this definition saying?Well, it's saying that you can get f of x as closeto L as you want.So if you tell someone, I want to getf of x within a certain range of L,then if this limit is actually true,if the limit of f of x as x approaches creally is equal to L, then they shouldbe able to find a range around c.That as long as x is around that range,your f of x is going to be in the range that you want.So let me actually go through that exercise.It really is a little bit like a game.So someone comes up to you and says, well, OK.I don't necessarily believe that you'reclaiming the limit of f of x as x approaches c is equal to L.I'm not really sure if that's the case.But I agree with this definition.So I want to get within 0.5.I want to get f of x within 0.5 of L. So this right over herewould be L plus 0.5.And this right over here is L minus 0.5.And then you say, fine.I'm going to give you a range around c,that if you take any x within that range, your f of xis always going to fall in this range that you care about.And so you look at this-- and obviously we haven't explicitlydefined this function.But you can even eyeball it, the way this function is defined.It won't be that easy for all functions.But you look at it like this.And you say that this value, just the wayit's drawn right over here, let'ssay that this is c minus 0.25.And let's say that this value right over here is c plus 0.25.And so you tell them, look, as longas you get x within 0.25 of c, so as longas your x's are sitting someplace over here,the corresponding f of x is going to sit in the rangethat you care about.And you say, OK, fine.You won that round.Let me make it even tighter.Maybe instead of saying within the 0.5, I want to get withinis 0.05.And then you'd have to do this exercise again and findanother range.And in order for this to be true,you would have to be able to do this for any rangethat they give you.For any range around L that they give you,you have to be able to get f of x within that rangeby finding a range around c.That as long as x is that range around c,f of x is going to sit within that range.So I'll let you think about that a little bit.There's a lot to think about.But hopefully this made sense.We did it for the particular example of someonehands you the 0.5, I want f of x within the 0.5 of L,and you say, well, as long as x is within 0.25 of c,you're going to match it.You need to be able to do that for any rangethey give you around L. And then this limitwill definitely be true.So in the next video, we will now generalize that.And that will really bring us to the famous epsilon deltadefinition of limits.

So you give a positive number epsilon.And epsilon is how close do you want to be?How close?So for example, if epsilon is 0.01,that says that you want f of x to be within 0.01 of epsilon.And so what I then do is I say well, OK.You've given me that epsilon.I'm going to find you another positive number which we'llcall delta-- the lowercase delta, the Greek letterdelta-- such that where if x is within delta of C,then f of x will be within epsilon of our limit.So let's see if these are really saying the same thing.In this yellow definition right over here,we said you can get f of x as closeas you want to L by making x sufficiently close to C.This second definition, which I kind ofmade as a little bit more of a game, is doing the same thing.Someone is saying how close they want f of x to be to Land the burden is then to find a delta where as longas x is within delta of C, then f of xwill be within epsilon of the limit.So that is doing it.It's saying look, if we are constraining x in such a waythat if x is in that range to C, thenf of x will be as close as you want.So let's make this a little bit clearerby diagramming right over here.You show up and you say well, I wantf of x to be within epsilon of our limit.This point right over here is our limit plus epsilon.And this right over here might be our limit minus epsilon.And you say, OK, sure.I think I can get your f of x within this range of our limit.And I can do that by defining a range around C.And I could visually look at this boundary.But I could even go narrower than that boundary.I could go right over here.Says OK, I meet your challenge.I will find another number delta.So this right over here is C plus delta.This right over here is C minus-- letme write this down-- is C minus delta.So I'll find you some delta so that if youtake any x in the range C minus delta to Cplus delta-- and maybe the function's not evendefined at C, so we think of onesthat maybe aren't C, but are getting very close.If you find any x in that range, f of thosex's are going to be as close as you want to your limit.They're going to be within the range L plus epsilon or Lminus epsilon.So what's another way of saying this?Another way of saying this is you give me an epsilon,then I will find you a delta.So let me write this in a little bit more math notation.So I'll write the same exact statementswith a little bit more math here.But it's the exact same thing.Let me write it this way.Given an epsilon greater than 0-- sothat's kind of the first part of the game--we can find a delta greater than 0, suchthat if x is within delta of C.So what's another way of saying that x is within delta of C?Well, one way you could say, well,what's the distance between x and Cis going to be less than delta.This statement is true for any x that's within delta of C.The difference between the two is going to be less than delta.So that if you pick an x that is in this range between Cminus delta and C plus delta, and theseare the x's that satisfy that right over here, then--and I'll do this in a new color-- thenthe distance between your f of x and your limit--and this is just the distance between the f of xand the limit, it's going to be less than epsilon.So all this is saying is, if the limit truly does exist,it truly is L, is if you give me any positive number epsilon,it could be super, super small one, we can find a delta.So we can define a range around Cso that if we take any x value thatis within delta of C, that's all this statementis saying that the distance between x and Cis less than delta.So it's within delta of C. So that'sthese points right over here.That f of those x's, the functionevaluated at those x's is going to be within the rangethat you are specifying.It's going to be within epsilon of our limit.The f of x, the difference between f of x, and your limitwill be less than epsilon.Your f of x is going to sit some place over there.So that's all the epsilon-delta definition is telling us.In the next video, we will prove that a limit existsby using this definition of limits.

Then the limit definitely exists.So let's try to do that.So let's think about being within delta of our C.So, let's think about this right over here is 5 plus delta,this is 5 minus delta.So that's our range we're going to think about.We're going to think about it in the abstract at first.And then we're going to try to come upwith a formula for delta in terms of epsilon.So how could we describe all of the x's that are in this rangebut not equal to 5 itself?Because we really care about the thingsthat are within delta of 5, but not necessarily equal to 5.This is just a strictly less than.They're within a range of C, but not equal to C.Well, that's going to be all of the x's that satisfy x minus 5is less than delta.That describes all of these x's right over here.And now, what we're going to do, and the way these proofstypically go, is we're going to tryto manipulate the left-hand side of the inequality,so it starts to look something like this,or it starts to look exactly like that.And as we do that, the right-hand sideof the inequality is going to be expressed in terms of delta.And then we can essentially say well, look.If the right-hand side is in termsof delta and the left-hand side looks justlike that, that really defines how we can express deltain terms of epsilon.If that doesn't make sense, bear with me.I'm about to do it.So, if we want x minus 5 to look a lot more like this, whenx is not equal to 5-- in all of this, this whole interval,x is not equal to 5-- f of x is equal to 2x,our proposed limit is equal to 10.So if we could somehow get this to be 2x minus 10,then we're in good shape.And the easiest way to do that isto multiply both sides of this inequality by 2.And 2 times the absolute value of something,that's the same thing as the absolute value of 2 timesthat thing.If I were to say 2 times the absolute value of a,that's the same thing as the absolute value of 2a.So on the left-hand side right over here,this is just going to be the absolute value of 2x minus 10.And it's going to be less than on the right-hand side,you just end up with a 2 delta.Now, what do we have here on the left-hand side?Well, this is f of x as long as x does not equal 5.And this is our limit.So we can rewrite this as f of x minus L is less than 2 delta.And this is for x does not equal 5.This is f of x, this literally is our limit.Now this is interesting.This statement right over here is almostexactly what we want right over here,except the right sides are just different.In terms of epsilon, this has it in terms of delta.So, how can we define delta so that 2 delta is essentiallygoing to be epsilon?Well, this is our chance.And this is where we're defining delta as a function of epsilon.We're going to make 2 delta equal epsilon.Or if you divide both sides by 2,we're going to make delta equal to epsilon over 2.Let me switch colors just to ease the monotony.If you make delta equal epsilon over 2,then this statement right over herebecomes the absolute value of f of x minus Lis less than, instead of 2 delta,it'll be less than 2 times epsilon over 2.It's just going to be less than epsilon.So this is the key.If someone gives you any positive number epsilonfor this function, as long as you make delta equal epsilonover 2, then any x within that range,that corresponding f of x is goingto be within epsilon of our limit.And remember, it has to be true for any positive epsilon.But you could see how the game could go.If someone gives you the epsilon,let's say they want to be within 0.5 of our limit.So our limit is up here, so our epsilon is 0.5.So it would literally be the range I want to be between 10plus epsilon would be 10.5.And then 10 minus epsilon would be 9.5.Well, we just came up with a formula.We just have to make delta equal to epsilonover 2, which is equal to 0.25.So that'll give us a range between 4.75 and 5.25.And as long as we pick an x between 4.75 and 5.25,but not x equals 5, the corresponding f of xwill be between 9.5 and 10.5.And so, you give me any epsilon, Ican just apply this formula right over hereto come up with the delta.This would apply for any real number.I mean, especially any positive number.For any epsilon you give me, I justget a delta defined this way, and then Ican go through this arc.If the absolute value of x minus 5 is less than delta,if delta is defined in this way, whichI could define for any epsilon, then itwill be the case that f of x willbe within epsilon of our limit.
0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-properties-of-limits/v/limit-properties	khanacademy	video	:00What I want to do in this video is give youa bunch of properties of limits.And we're not going to prove it rigorously here.In order to have the rigorous proof of these properties,we need a rigorous definition of what a limit is.And we're not doing that in this tutorial,we'll do that in the tutorial on the epsilon deltadefinition of limits.But most of these should be fairly intuitive.And they are very helpful for simplifying limit problemsin the future.So let's say we know that the limit of some functionf of x, as x approaches c, is equal to capital L.And let's say that we also know that the limitof some other function, let's say g of x, as x approaches c,is equal to capital M.Now given that, what would be the limit of fof x plus g of x as x approaches c?Well-- and you could look at this visually,if you look at the graphs of two arbitrary functions,you would essentially just add those two functions--it'll be pretty clear that this is going to be equal to--and once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof,I'm just really giving you the properties here--this is going to be the limit of f of x as x approaches c,plus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.Which is equal to, well this right over hereis-- let me do that in that same color--this right here is just equal to L.It's going to be equal to L plus M. This right over hereis equal to M.Not too difficult.This is often called the sum rule, or the sum property,of limits.And we could come up with a very similar one with differences.The limit as x approaches c of f of x minus g of x,is just going to be L minus M. It's justthe limit of f of x as x approachesc, minus the limit of g of x as x approaches c.So it's just going to be L minus M.And we also often call it the differencerule, or the difference property, of limits.And these once again, are very, very, hopefully, reasonablyintuitive.Now what happens if you take the product of the functions?The limit of f of x times g of x as x approaches c.Well lucky for us, this is going to beequal to the limit of f of x as x approachesc, times the limit of g of x, as x approaches c.Lucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive propertyof limits.So in this case, this is just goingto be equal to, this is L times M. This is justgoing to be L times M. Same thing,if instead of having a function here, we had a constant.So if we just had the limit-- letme do it in that same color-- the limit of k timesf of x, as x approaches c, where k is just some constant.This is going to be the same thing as k times the limitof f of x as x approaches c.And that is just equal to L. So this whole thingsimplifies to k times L.And we can do the same thing with difference.This is often called the constant multiple property.We can do the same thing with differences.So if we have the limit as x approachesc of f of x divided by g of x.This is the exact same thing as the limitof f of x as x approaches c, dividedby the limit of g of x as x approaches c.Which is going to be equal to-- I think you get it now--this is going to be equal to L over M.And finally-- this is sometimes called the quotient property--finally we'll look at the exponent property.So if I have the limit of-- let mewrite it this way-- of f of x to some power.And actually, let me even write itas a fractional power, to the r over spower, where both r and s are integers, then the limit of fof x to the r over s power as x approaches c,is going to be the exact same thing as the limit of fof x as x approaches c raised to the r over s power.Once again, when r and s are both integers, and sis not equal to 0.Otherwise this exponent would not make much sense.And this is the same thing as L to the r over s power.So this is equal to L to the r over s power.So using these, we can actually findthe limit of many, many, many things.And what's neat about it is the property of limits kind ofare the things that you would naturally want to do.And if you graph some of these functions,it actually turns out to be quite intuitive.

you get zero over zero: it's not definedSo to answer this question let's try to re-write the same exact function definition slightly differentlySo let's say f(x) is going to be equal to - and I'm going to think of two cases:I'm going to think of the case when x is greater than threeand when x is less than threeSo when x is - I'll do this in two different colors actuallyWhen x - I'll do it in green - that's not greenWhen x is greater than three...When x is greater than three, what does this function simplify to?Well, whatever I get up here, I'm just taking the..I'm going to get a positive value up here and then I'm...Well, if I take the absolute value it's going to be the exact same thing, so let me...For x is greater than three, this is going to be the exact same thing as x minus three over x minus threebecause if x is greater than three, the numerator's going to be positive, you take the absolute value of that, you're not going to change its valueso you get this right over here or, if we were to re-write it......if we were to re-write it, this is equal to, for x is greater than three, you're going to have f(x) is equal to onefor x is greater than threeSimilarly, let's think about what happens when x is less than threeWhen x is less than three, well, x minus three is going to be a negative numberWhen you take the absolute value of that, you're essentially negating itso it's going to be the negative of x minus three over x minus threeor if you were to simplify these two things, for any value as long as x doesn't equal threethis part right over her simplifies to one, so you are left with a negative onenegative one for x is less than threeI encourage you, if you don't believe what I just said, try it out with some numbersTry out some numbers:3.1, 3.001, 3.5, 4, 7Any number greater than three, you're going to get oneYou're going to get the same thing divided by the same thingand try values for x less than three:you're going to get negative one no matter what you trySo let's visualise this function nowSo, now you draw some axes...That's my x- axisand then this is my...This is my f(x) axis - y is equal to f(x)and what we care about is x is equal to threeso x is equal to one, two, three, four, fiveand we could keep going...and let's say this is positive one, two, so that's y is equal to onethis is y is equal to negative one and negative twoand we can keep going...So this way that we have re-written the functionis the exact same function as thiswe've just written [it] in a different wayand so what we're saying is...is we're...Our function is undefined at threebut if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to oneso if our x is greater than three, our function is equal to oneso it looks like...It looks like that, and it's undefined at threeand if x is less than three our function is equal to negative oneso it looks like - I'll be doing that same colorIt looks like this...It looks like...Looks like this...Once again, it's undefined at threeSo it looks like thatSo now let's try to answer our question:What is the limit as x approaches three?Well, let's think about the limit as x approaches threefrom the negative direction, from values less than threeSo let's think about first the limit......the limit, as x approaches three......as x approaches three, the limit of f(x)......as x approaches three from the negative directionand all this notation here - I wrote this negative as a superscript right after the three - saysLet's think about the limit as we're approaching......let me make this clear...Let's think about the limit as we're approaching from the leftSo in this case, if we get closer...If we get...If we start with values lower than threeas we get closer and closer and closer...So, say we start at zero, f(x) is equal to negative oneWe go to one, f(x) is equal to negative oneWe go to two, f(x) is equal to negative oneIf you go to 2.999999, f(x) is equal to negative oneSo it looks like it is approaching negative one if you approach.....if you approach from the left-hand sideNow let's think about the limit......the limit of f(x)......the limit of f(x) as x approaches three from the positive direction, from values greater than threeSo here we see, when x is equal to five, f(x) is equal to oneWhen x is equal to four, f(x) is equal to oneWhen x is equal to 3.0000001, f(x) is equal to oneSo it seems to be approaching...It seems to be approaching positive oneSo now we have something strangeWe seem to be approaching a different value when we approach from the leftthan when we approach from the rightand if we are approaching two different values then the limit does not existSo this limit right over here does not existor another way of saying it:The limit......the limit of...(Let me write this in a new color - I have a little idea here)...the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches some value c is equal to L if and only if......if and only if the limit of f(x) as x approaches c from the negative direction is equal to the limitof f(x) as x approaches c from the positive direction which is equal to LThis did not happen here -the limit when we approached the left was negative one,the limit when we approached from the right was positive one,So we did not get the same limits when we approached from either sideSo the limit does not exist in this case

the limitas x approaches negative 1of x plus 1over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2.So, our first reaction might just be,okay, well let's just use our limit propertiesa little bit,this is going to be the same thing as the limitas x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1over,over the limit,the limitas x approaches negative 1of square root of x plus 5 minus 2.And then we could say, all right,this thing up here,x plus 1, if this is,if we think about the graph y equals x plus 1,it's continuous everywhere, especially atx equals negative 1, and so to evaluate this limit,we just have to evaluate this expression atx equals negative 1,so this numerator's just going to evaluate to negative 1plus 1.And then our denominator,square root of x plus 5 minus 2 isn't continuous everywherebut it is continuous at x equals negative 1and so we can do the same thing.We can just substitute negative 1 for x,so this is going to be the square root of negative 1plus 5 minus 2.Now, what does this evaluate to?Well, in the numerator we get a zero,and in the denominator, negative 1 plus 5 is 4,take the principle root is 2, minus 2,we get zero again,so we get,we got zeroover zero.Now, when you see that, you might be tempted to give up.You say, oh, look, there's a zero in the denominator,maybe this limit doesn't exist,maybe I'm done here, what do I do?And if this was non-zero up here in the numerator,if you're taking a non-zero value and dividing it by zero,that is undefinedand your limit would not exist.But when you have zero over zero,this is indeterminate form,it doesn't mean necessarily that your limit does not exist,and as we'll see in this video and many future ones,there are tools at our disposal to address this,and we will look at one of them.Now, the tool that we're going to look atis is there another way of rewriting this expressionso we can evaluate its limitwithout getting the zero over zero?Well, let's just rewrite,let's just take this and give it,so let's take this thing right over here,and let's say this is g of x,so essentially what we're trying to do is find the limitof g of xas x approaches negative 1,so we can write g of x is equal tox plus 1 and the only reason I'm defining it as g of xis just to be able to think of it more clearly as a functionand manipulate the functionand then think about similar functions,over x plus 5 minus 2,or x plus 1 over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2.Now, the technique we're going to use is when you getthis indeterminate form and if you have a square rootin either the numerator or the denominator,it might help to get rid of that square rootand this is often called rationalizing the expression.In this case, you have a square root in the denominator,so it would be rationalizingthe denominator,and so, this would be,the way we would do itis we would be leveraging our knowledge of differenceof squares.We know,we know that a plus btimes a minus bis equal to a squared minus b squared,you learned that in algebraa little while ago,or if we had the square root of a plus band we were to multiply that times the square root of aminus b, well that would be the square root of a squaredwhich is just going to be a,minus b squared,so we can just leverage these ideasto get rid of this radical down here.The way we're going to do itis we're going to multiply the numerator and the denominatorby the square root of x plus 5plus 2, right?We have the minus 2so we multiply it times the plus 2,so let's do that.So we havesquare root of x plus 5 plus 2and we're going to multiply the numerator timesthe same thing, 'cause we don't want to change the valueof the expression.This is 1.So, if we take the expression divided by the same expressionit's going to be 1,so this is,so square root of x plus 5 plus 2and so this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to x plus 1times the square root,times the square root of x plus 5plus 2and then the denominator is going to be,well, it's going to be x,the square root of x plus 5 squaredwhich would be just x plus 5and then minus 2 squared,minus 4,and so this down here simplifies to x plus 5 minus 4is just x plus 1so this is just,this is just x plus 1and it probably jumps out at you that both the numeratorand the denominator have an x plus 1 in it,so maybe we can simplify,so we can simplify by just say,well, g of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5plus 2.Now, some of you might be feeling a little off here,and you would be correct.Your spider senses would be,is this,is this definitely the same thingas what we originally had before we cancelled outthe x plus 1s?And the answer is the way I just wrote itis not the exact same thing.It is the exact same thing everywhere except atx equals negative 1.This thing right over here is definedat x equals negative 1.This thing right over here is not definedat x equals negative 1,and g of x was not,was not,so g of x right over here,you don't get a good result when you try x equals negative 1and so in order for this to truly be the same thingas g of x,the same function, we have to sayfor x not equal to negative 1.Now, this is a simplified version of g of x.It is the same thing.For any input x,that g of x is defined, this is going to give you the sameoutput, and this is the exact same domain now,now that we've put this constraint in,as g of x.Now you might say, okay, well how does this help us?Because we want to find the limit as x approaches negative 1and even here, I had to put this little constraint herethat x cannot be equal to negative 1.How do we think about this limit?Well, lucky for us,we know,lucky for us we knowthat if we just take another function, f of x,if we say f of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5plus 2,well then we know that f of x is equal to g of xfor allx not equal to negative 1because f of x does not have that constraint.And we know if this is true of two,if this is true of two functions,then the limit as x approaches,the limit, let me write this down,since we know this,because of this,we know that the limitof f of xas x approaches negative 1 is going to be equalto the limit of g of xas x approaches negative 1,and this of course is what we want to figure out,what was the beginning of the problem,but we can now use f of x here,because only at x equals negative 1that they are not the same,and if you were to graph g of xit just has a,it has a point discontinuity,or removable discont--or, I should say, yeah,a point discontinuity right over hereat x equals negative 1,and so what is the limit?And we are in the home stretch now.What is the limitof f of x?Well, we could say the limit of the square root of x plus 5plus 2as x approaches negative 1,well, this expression is continuous.Or, this function is continuous at x equals negative 1so we can just evaluate it at x equals negative 1,so this is going to be the square root of negative 1plus 5 plus 2,so this is 4 square root,principle root of 4 is 2,2 plus 2 is equal to 4.So since the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1is 4, the limit of g of xas x approaches negative 1 is also 4,and if this little,this little,I guess you could say leap that I just made over heredoesn't make sense to you,think about it,think about it visually.Think about it visually.So if this ismy y-axisand this is my x-axis,g of x looked something like this.G of x,g of x, let me draw it,g of x looked something,something likethis,and it had a gap at negative 1,so it had a gap right over there,while f of x,f of x would have the same graphexcept it wouldn't have,it wouldn't have the gap,and so if you're trying to find the limit,it seems completely reasonable,well let's just use f of x and evaluate whatf of x would be to kind of fill that gapat x equals negative 1,so hopefully this graphical version helps a little bitor if it confuses you, ignore it.

we can find the limitas theta approaches zero of one minus cosine thetaover two sine squared theta.And like always, pause the video and see if youcould work through this.Alright, well our first temptation is to say,""Well, this is going to be the same thing""as the limit of one minus cosine theta""as X approaches, or not X,""as theta approaches zero.""of theta, as theta approaches zero,""over the limit,""as theta approaches zero""of two sine squared theta.""Now, both of these expressionswhich could be used to define a function,that they'd be continuous if you graph them.They'd be continuous at theta equals zero,so the limit is going to be the same thing,as just evaluating them at theta equals zeroSo this is going to be equal to one minus cosine of zeroover two sine squared of zero.Now, cosine of zero is one and then one minus one is zero,and sine of zero is zero, and you square it,You still got zero and you multiply times two,you still got zero.So you got zero over zero.So once again, we have that indeterminate form.And once again, this indeterminate formwhen you have zero over zero, doesn't mean to give up,it doesn't mean that the limit doesn't exist.It just means, well maybethere's some other approaches here to work on.If you got some non-zero number divided by zero,then you say, okay that limit doesn't existand you would say, well you just say it doesn't exist.But let's see what we can do to maybe, to maybe thinkabout this expression in a different way.So if we said,so let's just say that this,let me use some other colors here.Let's say that this right over hereis F of X.So, F of X is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two sine squared theta,and let's see if we can rewrite it in some waythat at least the limit as theta approaches zeroisn't going to, we're not gonna get the samezero over zero.Well, we can, we got some trig functions here,so maybe we can use some of our trig identitiesto simplify this.And the one that jumps out at meis that we have the sine squared of thetaand we know from the Pythagorean, Pythagorean Identityin Trigonometry, it comes straight out of the unit circledefinition of sine and cosine.We know that, we know that sine squared thetaplus cosine squared theta is equal to oneor, we know that sine squared thetais one minus cosine squared theta.One minus cosine squared theta.So we could rewrite this.This is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two times one minus cosine squared theta.Now, this is one minus cosine theta.This is a one minus cosine squared theta,so it's not completely obvious yetof how you can simplify it,until you realize that this could be viewedas a difference of squares.If you view this as,if you view this as A squared minus B squared,we know that this can be factored as A plus Btimes A minus B.So I could rewrite this.This is equal to one minus cosine thetaover two times,I could write this as one plus cosine thetatimes one minus cosine theta.One plus cosine theta times one minus, one minuscosine theta.And now this is interesting.I have one minus cosine thetain the numerator and I have a one minus cosine thetain the denominator.Now we might be tempted to say,""Oh, let's just cross that out with that""and we would get, we would simplify it""and get F of X is equal to one over""and we could distribute this two now.""We could say, ""Two plus two cosine theta.""We could say,""Well, aren't these the same thing?""And we would be almost right,because F of X, this one right over here,this, this is definedthis right over here is definedwhen theta is equal to zero,while this one is not defined when thetais equal to zero.When theta is equal to zero,you have a zero in the denominator.And so what we need to do in orderfor this F of X or in orderto be, for this to be the same thing,we have to say, theta cannot be equal to zero.But now let's think about the limit again.Essentially, what we want to do is we want to findthe limit as theta approaches zeroof F of X.And we can't just do direct substitutioninto, if we do, if we really take this seriously,'cause we're gonna like,""Oh well, if I try to put zero here,""it says theta cannot be equal to zero""F of X is not defined at zero.""This expression is defined at zerobut this tells me,""Well, I really shouldn't apply zero to this function.""But we know that if we can find another functionthat is defined, that is the exact same thing asF of X except at zero,and it is continuous at zero.And so we could say,""G of X is equal to one over two plus two""cosine theta.""Well then we know this limit is going to be theexact same thing as the limitof G of X, as theta approaches zero.Once again, these two functionsare identical except F of X is not definedat theta equals zero,while G of X is.But the limits as theta approaches zeroare going to be the same.And we've seen that in previous videos.And I know what a lot of you are thinking.Sal, this seems like a very, you know,why don't I just, you know, do this algebra here.Cross these things out of this.Substitute zero for theta.Well you could do that and you would get the answer,but you need to be clear if, or it's importantto be mathematically clear of what you are doing.If you do that, if you just crossed these two outand all of a sudden you're expressionbecomes defined at zero,you are now dealing with a different expressionor a different function definition.So to be clear, if you want to say this is the functionyou're finding the limit of,you have to put this constraint into make sure it has the exact same domain.But lucky for us, we can say,if we've had another, another function that's continuousat that point that doesn't have that gap there,that doesn't have that point discontinuity out,the limits are going to be equivalent.So the limit as theta approaches zero of G of X,well, that's just going to besince it's continuous at zero.We could say that's just going to be,we can just substitute.That's going to be equal to G of zerowhich is equal to one over two pluscosine two, one over two plus two times cosineof zero.Cosine of zero is one,so it's just one over two plus two,which is equal to,deserve a little bit of a drum roll here.Which is equal to one fourth.And we are done."

let's see if we can find the limitof 1 over the square root of 2 sine of thetaover cosine of 2 theta,as theta approaches negative pi over 4.And like always, try to give it a shot before we go throughit together.Well, one take on it is well, let's just,let's just say that this is going to be the same thingas the limit,as theta approaches negative pi over 4of 1 plus square root of 2 sine thetaover the limitas theta approaches negative pi over 4.Make sure we can see that negative there,of cosine of 2 theta,and both of these expressions are,if these were function definitionsor if we were to graph y equals1 plus square root of sine,square root of 2 times sine theta,or y equals cosine of 2 theta,we would get continuous functions,especially at theta is equal to negative pi over 4,so we could just substitute in.We'll see well this is going to be equal tothis expression evaluated at negative pi over 4,so 1 plus square root of 2times sine of negative pi over 4,over cosineof 2 times negative pi over 4.Now, negative pi over 4,sine of negative pi over 4 is going to benegative square root of 2 over 2,so this is negative square root of 2 over 2,we're assuming this is in radians,if we're thinking in degrees, this would bea negative 45-degree angle, so this is one of the,one of the trig values that it's good to knowand so if you have,if you have 1,so let's see,actually, let me just rewrite it,so this is going to be equal to 1 plussquare root of 2 times thatis going to be negative 2 over 2,so this is going to beminus 1,that's the numerator over here.All of this stuff simplifies to negative 1over,this is going to be cosine ofnegative pi over 2, right?This is negative pi over 2,cosine of negative pi over 2, if you thought in degrees,that's going to be negative 90 degrees.Well, cosine of that is just going to be zero,so what we end up withis equal to zero over zero,and as we've talked about before,if we had something non-zero divided by zero,we'd say, okay, that's undefined.We might as well give up,but we have this indeterminate form, it does not meanthe limit does not exist.It's usually a clue that we should use some toolsin our toolkit, one of which is to do some manipulationhere to get an expression that maybe is definedat theta is equal to,or does not,is not an indeterminate form,that theta is equal to pi over 4and we'll see other tools in our toolkit in the future.So let me algebraically manipulate this a little bit.So if I have 1 plus the square root of 2,sine theta, over cosine 2 theta,as you can imagine,the things that might be useful here are our trig identitiesand in particular, cosine of 2 theta seems interesting.Let me write some trig identities involving cosineof 2 theta.I'll write it over here.So we know that cosineof 2 thetais equal tocosine squared of thetaminus sine squared of thetawhich is equal to 1minus 2 sine squared of thetawhich is equal to2 cosine squared theta minus 1,and you can go from this one to this one to this onejust using the Pythagorean identity.We proved that in earlier videos in trigonometryon Khan Academy.Now, do any of these look useful?Well, all of these three are going to be differencesof squares, so we can factor them in interesting ways,and remember, our goal at the end of the dayis maybe cancel things out that are making us get thiszero over zero,and if I could factor thisinto something that involved a 1 plus square rootof 2 sine theta,then I'm going to be in business,and it looks like,it looks like this right over here,that can be factored as1 plus square root of 2 sine thetatimes1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,so let me use this.Cosine of 2 theta is the same thing,cosine of 2 theta is the same thingas 1 minus 2 sine squared theta,which is just a difference of squares.We can rewrite that as,this is a-squared minus b-squared,this is a plus b times a minus b,so I can just replace this with1 plus square root of 2 sine thetatimes 1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,and now, we have some nice cancelling,or potential cancelling that can occur,so we could saythat cancels with thatand we could say that that is going to be equal,and let me do this in a new color,this is going to be equal to,in the numerator we just have 1,in the denominator we just are left with1 minus square root of 2 sine theta,and if we want these expressions to truly be equal,we would have to have them to have the same,if you view them as function definitions,as having the same domain,so this one right over here,this one we already saw isnot defined at theta is equal to negative pi over 4,and so this one,in order for these to be equivalent,we have to say that this one is also not,and actually, other places, but let's just,let's just say thetadoes not,does not equal negative,negative pi over 4,and we could think about all of this happeningin some type of an open interval around negative pi over 4if we wanted to get very precise,but if we wanted to,for this particular case,well, let's just say,everything we're doing is in the open interval,so in,in open interval,in open interval betweentheta,or, say, negative 1 and 1,and I think that covers itbecause if we have pi,if we have pi over 4that is not going to get us thezero over zero form,and pi over 4would make this denominator equal to zerobut it also makes,let's see, pi over 4 also will make this denominatorequal to zero,'cause we would get 1 minus 1,so I think,I think we're good if we're just assuming,if we're restricted to this open intervaland that's okay because we're taking the limitas it approaches something within this open interval,and I'm being extra precise because I'm trying to explain itto you and it's important to be precise,but obviously, if you're working this out on a testor notebook, you wouldn't be taking,putting,or taking as much troubleto be putting all of these caveats in.So, what we've now realizedis that, okay,this expression,actually, let's think about this.Let's think about the limit,the limit as theta approaches negative pi over 4of this thing,without the restriction,of 1 over 1 minus the square root of 2sine of theta.If we're dealing with this over,you know, with this open interval,wait, actually, even disregarding that,theta,this theta,or this expression is continuous at,it is defined and it is continuousat theta is equal to negative pi over 4so this is just going to be equal to1 over 1 minus the square root of 2times sine ofnegative pi over 4.Sine of negative pi over 4.Sine of negative pi over 4,we've already seen is negative square root of 2 over 2,and so this is going to be equal to 1 over1 minus square root of 2 timesthe negative square root of 2 over 2,so negative, negative,you get a positive,square root of 2 times square root of 2is 2, over 2 is going to be 1.So this is going to be equal to 1/2.And so,I want to be very clear.This expression is not the same thingas this expression.They are the same thing at all values of theta,especially if we're dealing in this open intervalexcept at theta equalsnegative pi over 4.This one is not definedand this one is defined,but as we've seen multiple times before,if we find a functionthat is equal to our originalor an expression,is equal to our original expression,and all values of thetaexcept,except where the original one was not definedat a certain point,but this new one is defined and is continuous there,well then these two limits are going to be equal,so if this limit is 1/2,then this limit is going to be 1/2,and I've said this in previous videos.It might be very tempting to say, well,I'm just going to algebraically simplify this in some wayto get this,and I'm not going to worry about too much aboutthese constraints, and then I'm just going to substitutenegative pi over 4,and you will get this answerwhich is the correct answerbut it's really important to recognizethat this expression and this expressionare not the same thingand what allows you to do this is,is the truththat if you have two functions,if you have f and g,two functions equal,let me write it this way,equal,equal forall x,except for all,wait, let me just write this this way,for all x except for a,then the limit,then, and let me write it this way,equal for all except,for all x except aand f continuous,continuous at a,then,then the limit of f of xas x approaches ais going to be equal to the limit of g of xas x approaches a,and I said this in multiple videosand that's what we are doing right here,but just so you can make sure you got it right,the answer here is 1/2.

exerciseswe cover the various techniquesfor finding limits.But sometimes, it's helpful to think about strategiesfor determining which technique to use.And that's what we're going to cover in this video.What you see here is a flowchartdeveloped by the team at Khan Academy,and I'm essentially going to work through that flowchart.It looks a little bit complicated at first,but hopefully it will make senseas we talk it through.So the goal is, hey,we want to find the limit of f of xas x approaches a.So what this is telling us to do is,well the first thing,just try to substitute what happens when x equals a.Let's evaluate f of a.And this flowchart says,if f of a is equal to a real number,it's saying we're done.But then there's this little caveat here.Probably.And the reason why is that the limit is a different thingthan the value of the function.Sometimes they happen to be the same.In fact, that's the definition of a continuous functionwhich we talk about in previous videos,but sometimes, they aren't the same.This will not necessarily be trueif you're dealing with some functionthat has apointdiscontinuity like thator a jump discontinuity,or a function that looks like this.This would not necessarily be the case.But if at that pointyou're trying to find the limit towards,as you approach this point right over here,the function is continuous,it's behaving somewhat normally,then this is a good thing to keep in mind.You could just say, hey,can I just evaluate the functionat thatat thata over there?So in general, if you're dealing withpretty plain vanilla functions like an x squaredor if you're dealing with rational expressions like thisor trigonometric expressions,and if you're able to just evaluate the functionand it gives you a real number,you are probably done.If you're dealing with some type of a functionthat has all sorts of special casesand it's piecewise definedas we've seen in previous other videos,I would be a little bit more skeptical.Or if you know visually around that point,there's some type of jumpor some type of discontinuity,you've got to be a little bit more careful.But in general,this is a pretty good rule of thumb.If you're dealing with plain vanilla functionsthat are continuous,if you evaluate at x equals aand you got a real number,that's probably going to be the limit.But I always think about the other scenarios.What happens if you evaluate itand you get some number divided by zero?Well, that case,you are probably dealing with a vertical asymptote.And what do we mean by vertical asymptote?Well, look at this example right over here.Where we just say the limitput that in a darker color.So if we're talking aboutthe limitas x approaches oneof one overx minus one,if you just try to evaluate this expressionat x equals one,you would get one over one minus onewhich is equal to one over zero.It says, okay,I'm throwing it,I'm falling into this vertical asymptote case.And at that point,if you wanted to just understand what was going on thereor even verify that it's a vertical asymptote,well then you can try out some numbers,you can try to plot it,you can say, alright,I probably have a vertical asymptote hereat x equals one.So that's my vertical asymptote.And you can try out some values.Well, let's see.If x is greater than one,the denominator is going to be positive,and so, my graphand you would get this from trying out a bunch of values.Might look something like thisand then for values less than negative oneor less than one I should say,you're gonna get negative valuesand so, your graph might looklike something like thatuntil you have this vertical asymptote.That's probably what you have.Now, there are cases,very special cases,where you won't necessarily have the vertical asymptote.One example of that would be something likeone over xminus x.This one here is actually undefined for any x you give it.So, it would be very,you will not have a vertical asymptote.But this is a very special case.Most times,you do have a vertical asymptote there.But let's say we don't fall into either of those situations.What if when we evaluate the function,we get zero over zero?And here is an example of that.Limit is x approaches negative oneof this rational expression.Let's try to evaluate it.You get negative one squared which is oneminus negative one which is plus oneminus two.So you get zero the numerator.And the denominator you have negative one squaredwhich is oneminus two times negative oneso plus twominus three which is equal to zero.Now this is known as indeterminate form.And so on our flowchart,we then continue to the right side of itand so here's a bunch of techniquesfor trying to tackle something in indeterminate form.Andlikely in a few weeksyou will learn another techniquethat involves a little more calculuscalled L'hospital's Rule that we don't tackle herebecause that involves calculuswhile all of these techniques can be donewith things before calculus.Some algebraic techniquesand some trigonometric techniques.So the first thing that you might want totry to doespecially if you're dealing with a rational expressionlike thisand you're getting indeterminate form,is try to factor it.Try to seeif you can simplify this expression.And this expression here,you can factor it.This is the same thing asxx minus twotimes x plus oneoverxthis would be x minus threetimes x plus oneif what I just did seems completely foreign to youI encourage you to watch the videos on factoringfactoring polynomialsor factoring quadratics.And so,you can see here, alright.If I make theI can simplify this 'causeas long as x does not equal negative one,these two things are going to cancel out.So I can say that this is going to be equal to x minus twoover x minus threefor x does not equal negative one.Sometimes people forget to do this part.This is if you're really being mathematically precise.This entire expression is the same as this one.Because this entire expression is still not definedif x equals negative one.Although you can substitute x equals negative one hereand now get a value.So if you substitute x equals negative one hereeven if it's formally taking it away to bemathematically equivalent,this would be negative oneminus twowhich would bewhich would be negative threeover negative one minus threewhich should be negative fourwhich is equal to three fourths.So if this condition wasn't here,you can just evaluate it straight up andthis is a pretty plain vanilla function.Wouldn't expect to see anything crazy happening here.And if I can just evaluate it at x equals negative oneI feel pretty good.I feel pretty good.So once again, we're now going in factoring.We're able to factor.We have valued,we simplify it.We evaluate the expressionthe simplified expression now,and now we were able to get a value.We were able to get three fourths,and so we can feel pretty good that the limit herein this situation is three fourths.Now, let'sand I would categorize what we've seenso far isthe bulk of the limit exercisesthat you will likely encounter.Now the next two,I would call slightly fancier techniques.So if you get indeterminate formespecially you'll sometimes see it with radical expressionslike this.Rational radical expressions.You might want to multiply by conjugate.So for example, in this situation right here,if you just try to evaluate it x equals four,you get the square root of four minus twoover four minus fourwhich is zero over zero.So it's that indeterminate form.And the technique here, because we're seeingthis radical and a rational expressionlet's say, maybe we can somehow get rid of that radicalor simplify it somehow.So let me rewrite.Square root of x minus twooverxminus four.Let's say a conjugate,let's multiply it by the square root of x plus twoover the square root of x plus two.Once again,it's the same expression over the same expression.So I'm not fundamentally changing its value.And so this is going to be equal to,well if I have a plus b times a minus bI'm gonna get a difference of squares.So it's gonna be square root of x squaredwhich is,it's going to be square root of x squaredminus fouroverwell square root of x squaredis just going to bex minus four.So let me rewrite it that way.So that's x minus fouroverx minus fourtimes square root of x plus two,square root of x plus two.Well, this was useful because nowI can cancel out x equals fouror x minus four right over here.And once again, if I wanted itmathematically to be the exact same expression,I'd say well, now this is going to be equal tooneone over the square root of x plus twofor x does not equal four,but we can definitely see whatthis function is approachingif we just now substitute x equals fourinto this simplified expression.And so, that's just gonna be one overso if we just substituteif we just substitute x equals four hereyou'd get one over square root of fourplus twowhich is equal to one fourth.And once again, you can feel pretty goodthat this is going to beyour limit.We've gone back into the green zone.If you're actually to plotthis original function,you would have a point discontinuity.You would have a gap at x equalsfourbut then when you do that simplificationand factoring out that x minusor canceling out that x minus four,that gap would disappear.So that's essentially what you're doing.You're trying to find the limit as we approachthat gap which we got right there.Now, this final one.This is dealing with trig identities.And in order to do these,you have to be pretty adept at your trig identities.So if we're saying the limit,I'll do that at a darker color.So if we're saying the limitas x approaches zeroof sine of xover sineof two xwell, sine of zero zero,sine of zero zero,you're gonna be at zero, zero.Once you get indeterminate form,we fall into this category,and now you might recognize this is going to beequal to the limitas x approaches zero of sine of xwe can rewrite sine of two xas two sinex cosine xand then those two can cancel out for all x's notequalingfor all x's not equaling zeroif you want to be really mathematically precise.And so, there would've been a gap there for sureon the original graphif you were to graph y equals this.But now, for the limit purposes,you can say this is this limitisthis limit is going to be the limitas x approaches zeroof one over two cosine of x.And now we can go back tothis green condition right over here,because we can evaluate this at x equals zero.It's going to be one over two times cosine of zero.Cosine of zero is one.So this is going to be equal to one half.Now in general, none of these techniques work,and you will encounter few other techniquesfurther on once you learn more calculus,then you fall on the base line.Approximation.And approximation, you can do it numerically.Try values really really really closeto the number you're trying to find the limit on.If you're trying to find the limit as x approaches zerotry 0.00000000001.Try negative 0.0000001if you're trying to find the limit is x approaches fourtry 4.0000001.Try 3.9999999999and see what happens.But that's kind of the last ditch.The last ditch effort.

Use other methods only when this fails, otherwise you're probably doing more work than you need to be. For example, it would be extra work to factor an expression into a simpler form if direct substitution would have worked without the factoring.Key point #1: Direct substitution is the go-to method.

A flow chart has options A through H, as follows. Step A, direct substitution. Try to evaluate the function directly. Evaluating f of a leads to options B through D. Option B: f of a = start fraction b divided by 0 end fraction, here b is not zero. The result is asymptote (probably). Option C: f of a = b, where b is a real number. The result is limit found (probably). Option D: f of a = start fraction 0 divided by 0 end fraction. Result is indeterminate form. From option D, try rewriting the limit in an equivalent form. This leads to options E through G. Option E: factoring. Option F: conjugates. Option G: trig identities. Using options E through G, try evaluating the limit in its new form, circling back to A, direct substitution. The other option is H, approximation: when all else fails, graphs and tables can help approximate limits.

And let's saythat the limit as x approaches c of h of x is also equal to L.So notice, as x approaches c, h of xapproaches L. As x approaches c from either side, f of xapproaches L.So these limits have to be defined.Actually, the functions don't haveto be defined at x approaches c.Just over this interval, they haveto be defined as we approach it.But over this interval, this has to be true.And if these limits right over here are definedand because we know that g of x is always sandwiched inbetween these two functions, therefore,on that day or for that x-value--I should get out of that food-eating analogy--this tells us if all of this is true over this interval,this tells us that the limit as x approaches c of g of xmust also be equal to L.And once again, this is common sense.f of x is approaching L, h of x is approachingL, g of x is sandwiched in between it.So it also has to be approaching L.And you might say, well, this is common sense.Why is this useful?Well, as you'll see, this is useful for findingthe limits of some wacky functions.If you can find a function that's always greater than itand a function that's always less than it,and you can find the limit as they approach some c,and it's the same limit, then youknow that that wacky function in betweenis going to approach that same limit."

prove that the limitas theta approaches zeroof sine of thetaover theta is equal to one.So let's start with a little bit of a geometricor trigonometric construction that I have here.So this white circle, this is a unit circle,that we'll label it as such.So it has radius one,unitcircle.So what does the lengthof this salmon-colored line represent?Well, the height of this line would be the y-coordinateof where this radius intersects the unit circle.And so by definition, by the unit circle definitionof trig functions, the length of this lineis going to be sine of theta.If we wanted to make sure that also worked for thetasthat end up in the fourth quadrant, which will be useful,we can just insure that it's the absolute valueof the sine of theta.Now what about this blue line over here?Can I express that in terms of a trigonometric function?Well, let's think about it.What would tangent of theta be?Let me write it over here.Tangent of thetais equal to opposite over adjacent.So if we look at this broader triangle right over here,this is our angle theta in radians.This is the opposite side.The adjacent side down here, this just has length one.Remember, this is a unit circle.So this just has length one,so the tangent of theta is the opposite side.The opposite side is equal to the tangent of theta.And just like before, this is going to be a positive valuefor sitting here in the first quadrantbut I want things to workin both the first and the fourth quadrantfor the sake of our proof,so I'm just gonna put an absolute value here.So now that we've done,I'm gonna think about some trianglesand their respective areas.So first, I'm gonna draw a trianglethat sits in this wedge, in this pie piece,this pie slice within the circle,so I can construct this triangle.And so let's think about the areaof what I am shading in right over here.How can I express that area?Well, it's a triangle.We know that the area of a triangleis 1/2 base times height.We know the heightis the absolute value of the sine of thetaand we know that the base is equal to one,so the area here is going to be equal to 1/2times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of the sine of theta.I'll rewrite it over here.I can just rewrite thatas the absolute value of the sine of theta over two.Now let's think about the area of this wedgethat I am highlighting in this yellow color.So what fraction of the entire circle is this going to be?If I were to go all the way around the circle,it would be two pi radians,so this is theta over to two pis of the entire circleand we know the area of the circle.This is a unit circle, it has a radius one,so it'd be times the area of the circle,which would be pi times the radius square,the radius is one, so it's just gonna be times pi.And so the area of this wedge right over here,theta over two.And if we wanted to make this workfor thetas in the fourth quadrant,we could just write an absolute value sign right over there'cause we're talking about positive area.And now let's think about this larger trianglein this blue color, and this is pretty straightforward.The area here is gonna be 1/2 times base times height.So the area, and once again, this is this entire are,that's going to be 1/2 times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of tangent of theta.And so I can just write that downas the absolute value of the tangent of theta over two.Now, how would you compare the areasof this pink or this salmon-colored trianglewhich sits inside of this wedgeand how do you compare that area of the wedgeto the bigger triangle?Well, it's clear that the area of the salmon triangleis less than or equal to the area of the wedgeand the area of the wedge is less than or equal tothe area of the big, blue triangle.The wedge includes the salmon triangleplus this area right over here,and then the blue triangle includes the wedgeplus it has this area right over here.So I think we can feel good visuallythat this statement right over here is trueand I'm just gonna doa little bit of algebraic manipulation.Let me multiply everything by twoso I can rewrite that the absolute valueof sine of theta is less than or equal tothe absolute value of thetawhich is less than or equal to the absolute valueof tangent of theta, and let's see.Actually, instead of writing the absolute valueof tangent of theta, I'm gonna rewrite thatas the absolute value of sine of thetaover the absolute value of cosine of theta.That's gonna be the same thingas the absolute value of tangent of theta.And the reason why I did thatis we can now divide everythingby the absolute value of sine of theta.Since we're dividing by a positive quantity,it's not going to change the direction of the inequalities.So let's do thatI'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of sine of theta.I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of thetaand then I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of theta.And what do I get?Well, over here, I get a oneand on the right-hand side, I get a oneover the absolute value of cosine theta.These two cancel out.So the next step I'm gonna dois take the reciprocal of everything.And so when I take the reciprocal of everything,that actually will switch the inequalities.The reciprocal of one is still going to be onebut now, since I'm taking the reciprocal of this here,it's gonna be greater than or equal tothe absolute value of the sine of thetaover the absolute value of theta,and that's going to be greater than or equal tothe reciprocal of oneover the absolute value of cosine of thetais the absolute value of cosine of theta.We really just care about the first and fourth quadrants.You can think about this thetaapproaching zero from that directionor from that direction there,so that would be the first and fourth quadrants.So if we're in the first quadrant and theta is positive,sine of theta is gonna be positive as well.And if we're in the fourth quadrant and theta's negative,well, sine of theta is gonna have the same sign.It's going to be negative as well.And so these absolute value signs aren't necessary.In the first quadrant,sine of theta and theta are both positive.In the fourth quadrant, they're both negative,but when you divide them,you're going to get a positive value, so I can erase those.If we're in the first or fourth quadrant,our X value is not negative,and so cosine of theta, which is the x-coordinateon our unit circle, is not going to be negative,and so we don't need the absolute value signs over there.Now, we should pause a secondbecause we're actually almost done.We have just set up three functions.You could think of this as f of x is equal to,you could view this as f of theta is equal to one,g of theta is equal to this,and h of theta is equal to that.And over the interval that we care about,we could say for negative pi over twois less than theta is less than pi over two,but over this interval, this is true for any thetaover which these functions are defined.Sine of theta over theta is defined over this interval,except where theta is equal to zero.But since we're defined everywhere else,we can now find the limit.So what we can say is, well, by the squeeze theoremor by the sandwich theorem,if this is true over the interval,then we also know that the following is true.And this, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.The limitas theta approaches zero of thisis going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this,which is the one that we care about,sine of theta over theta,which is going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this.Now this is clearly going to be just equal to one.This is what we care about.And this, what's the limit as theta approaches zeroof cosine of theta?Well, cosine of zero is just oneand it's a continuous function,so this is just gonna be one.So let's see.This limit is going to be less than or equal to oneand it's gonna be greater than or equal to one,so this must be equal to oneand we are done.

0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-limits-and-continuity/cs1-types-of-discontinuities/v/types-of-discontinuities	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois talk about the various types of discontinuitiesthat you've probably seen when you took algebra,or precalculus, but then relate it to our understandingof both two-sided limits and one-sided limits.So let's first review the classification of discontinuities.So here on the left, you see that this curvelooks just like y equals x squared,until we get to x equals three.And instead of it being three squared,at this point you have this opening,and instead the function at three is defined at four.But then it keeps going and it looks just likey equals x squared.This is known as a point,or a removable, discontinuity.And it's called that for obvious reasons.You're discontinuous at that point.You might imagine defining or redefining the functionat that point so it is continuous,so that this discontinuity is removable.But then how does this relate to our definitionof continuity?Well, let's remind ourselves our definition of continuity.We say f is continuous,continuous,if and only if,or let me write f continuousat x equals c, if and only ifthe limit as x approaches cof f of x is equal to the actual value of the functionwhen x is equal to c.So why does this one fail?Well, the two-sided limit actually exists.You could find, if we say c in this case is three,the limitas x approaches threeof f of x,it looks like, and if you graphically inspect this,and I actually know this is the graph of y equals x squared,except at that discontinuity right over there,this is equal to nine.But the issue is, the way this graph has been depicted,this is not the same thing as the value of the function.This functionf of three, the way it's been graphed,f of three is equal to four.So this is a situation where this two-sided limit exists,but it's not equal to the value of that function.You might see other circumstances where the functionisn't even defined there,so that isn't even there.And so, once again, the limit might exist,but the function might not be defined there.So, in either case, you aren't going to meet this criteriafor continuity.And so that's how a point or removable discontinuity,why it is discontinuouswith regards to our limit definition of continuity.So now let's look at this second example.If we looked at our intuitive continuity test,if we would just try to trace this thing,we see that once we get to x equals two,I have to pick up my pencil to keep tracing it.And so that's a pretty good sign that we are discontinuous.We see that over here as well.If I'm tracing this function, I gotta pick up my pencil to,I can't go to that point.I have to jump down here,and then keep going right over there.So in either case I have to pick up my pencil.And so, intuitively, it is discontinuous.But this particular type of discontinuity,where I am making a jump from one point,and then I'm making a jump down here to continue,it is intuitively called a jumpdiscontinuity,discontinuity.And this is, of course, a point removable discontinuity.And so how does this relate to limits?Well, here, the left and right-handed limits exist,but they're not the same thing,so you don't have a two-sided limit.So, for example, for this one in particular,for all the x-values up to and including x equals two,this is the graph of y equals x squared.And then for x greater than two,it's the graph of square root of x.So in this scenario,if you were to take the limitof f of xas x approachestwofrom the left,from the left,this is going to be equal to four,you're approaching this value.And that actually is the value of the function.But if you were to take the limit as x approaches twofrom the right of f of x,what is that going to be equal to?Well, approaching from the right,this is actually the square root of x,so it's approaching the square root of two.You wouldn't know it's the square root of twojust by looking at this.I know that, just because when I,when I went on to Desmos and defined the function,that's the function that I used.But it's clear even visuallythat you're approaching two different valueswhen you approach from the leftthan when you approach from the right.So even though the one-sided limits exist,they're not approaching the same thing,so the two-sided limit doesn't exist.And if the two-sided limit doesn't exist,it for sure cannot be equal to the valueof the function there, even if the function is defined.So that's why the jump discontinuity is failing this test.Now, once again, it's intuitive.You're seeing that, hey, I gotta jump,I gotta pick up my pencil.These two things are not connected to each other.Finally, what you see here is,when you learned precalculus,often known as an asymptotic discontinuity,asymptotic,asymptoticdiscontinuity,discontinuity.And, intuitively, you have an asymptote here.It's a vertical asymptote at x equals two.If I were to try to trace the graphfrom the left,I would just keep on going.In fact, I would be doing it forever, 'cause it's,it would be infinitely,it would be unbounded as I get closer and closerto x equals two from the left.And if try to get to x equals two from the right,once again I get unbounded up.But even if I could,and when I say it's unbounded, it goes to infinity,so it's actually impossiblein a mortal's lifespan to try to trace the whole thing.But you get the sense that, hey, there's no way that I coulddraw from here to here without picking up my pencil.And if you wanna relate it to our notion of limits,it's thatboth the left and right-handed limits are unbounded,so they officially don't exist.So if they don't exist, then we can't meet these conditions.So if I were to say,the limitas x approaches two from the left-hand side of f of x,we can see that it goes unbounded in the negative direction.You might sometimes see someone write something like this,negative infinity.But that's a little handwavy with the math.The more correct way to say it is it's just unbounded,unbounded.And, likewise, if we thought about the limitas x approaches twofrom the rightof f of x,it is now unbounded towards positive infinity.So this, once again,this is also,this is also unbounded.Andbecause it's unbounded and this limit does not exist,it can't meet these conditions.And so we are going to be discontinuous.So this is a point or removable discontinuity,jump discontinuity, I'm jumping,and then we have these asymptotes, a vertical asymptote.This is an asymptotic discontinuity.

come up with a more rigorous definition for continuity.And the general idea of continuity,we've got an intuitive idea of the past,is that a function is continuous at a point,is if you can draw the graph of that functionat that point without picking up your pencil.So what do we mean by that?And this is...What I just said is not that rigorous,or not rigorous at all,is that well, let's think about the point right over here.Let's say that's RC.If I can draw the graph at that point,the value of the function at that pointwithout picking up my pencil, or my pen,then it's continuous there.So I could just start here,and I don't have to pick up my pencil,and there you go.I can go through that point,so we could say that our function is continuous there.But if I had a function that lookedsomewhat different that that,if I had a function that looked like this,let's say that it is defined up until then,and then there's a bit of a jump,and then it goes like this,well this would be very hard to draw at...This function would be very hard to drawgoing through x equals c without picking up my pen.Let's see, my pen is touching the screen,touching the screen, touching the screen.How do I keep drawing this functionwithout picking up my pen?I would have to pick it up,and then move back down here.And so that is an intuitive sensethat we are not continuous in this case right over here.Well let's actually come upwith a formal definition for continuity,and then see if it feels intuitive for us.So the formal definition of continuity, let's start here,we'll start with continuity at a point.So we could say the function f is continuous...Continuous at x equals c.If, and only if...I'll draw this two-way arrow to show if, and only if,the two-sided limit of f of x,as x approaches c,is equal to f of c.So this seems very technical.But let's just think about what it's saying.It's saying look,if the limit as we approach cfrom the left and the right of f of x,if that's actually the value of our function there,then we are continuous at that point.So let's look at three examples.Let's look at one example, we are, we're...By our picking-up-the-pencil idea,it feels like we are continuous at a point.And then let's think about a couple of exampleswhere it doesn't seem like we're continuous at a point,and see how this more rigorous definition applies.So, let's say that my function...So let's say this right over hereis y is equal to f of x.And, we care about the behavior right over herewhen x is equal to c.This is my X-axis, that's my Y-axis.So we care about the behavior when x is equal to c.And so, notice,from our first intuitive sense,I can definitely draw this functionas we go through x equals c without picking up my pencil,so it feels continuous there.There's no jumps or discontinuities that we can tell.It just kind of keeps on going.It seems all connected, is one way to think about it.But let's think about this definition.Well, the limit as x approaches c from the left, it is...As we approach from the left,it looks like it is approaching...It looks like it is approaching f of c.So this is the value, f of c right over here.And as we approach from the right,as we approach from the right,it also looks like it's approaching f of c.And we are defined right at x equals c.And it is the value that we are approachingfrom both the left or the right.So this seems good in this scenario.So now let's look at some scenariosthat we would have to pick up the pencilas we draw the function through that point, through that...Through that...When x is equal to c.So let's look at a scenario.Let's look at a scenario where we havewhat's often called a point discontinuity,although you don't have to know at this point,no pun intended, the formal terminology for it.So let's say we have a function that...Let's see, this is c.Now let's say our function looks something...Something like this.So we go like this,and at c let's say it's equal to that.So, f of c is right over here.F of c would be that value.But what's the limit as x approaches c?So the limit as x approaches c,this would be a two-sided limit of f of x.Well, this is, as we approach from the left,it looks like we are approaching this value right over here.And from the right,it looks like we are approaching that same value.And so, we could call that L.And L is different than f of c.And so, in this case, by our formal definition,we will not be continuous at, for...F will not be continuous for x is equal...Or at the point x...Or when x is equal to c.And you can see that there.If we try to draw this, okay,my pencil is touching the paper,touching the paper, touching the paper.Uh oh, if I needed to keep drawing this function,I'd have to pick up my pencil, move it over here,then pick it up again and then jump right back down.And but this rigorous definitionis giving us the same conclusion.The limit as we approach x equals cfrom the left and the right,it's a different value than f of c.And so, this is not continuous.Not...Not continuous.And let's think about another scenario.Let's think about a scenario...And actually, maybe let's think about a scenariowhere the limit...The two-sided limit doesn't even exist.So, there are my axes, x and y.And let's say it's doing something like this.Let's say it's doing something like this,and that it does something like this and goes like that.And let's say that this right over here is our c.And so let's see, this is f of c right over here.That is...Lemme draw a little bit neater.That is f of c.And it does look like the limit,as x approaches c from the left,so from values less than c,it does look like that is approaching f of c.But if we look at the limitas x approaches c from the right,that looks like it's approaching some other value.That looks like it's approaching this value right over here,let's call it L.That's approaching L,and L does not equal f of c.And so in this situation,the two-sided limit doesn't even exist.We're approaching two different valueswhen we approach from the left and from the right.And since so the limit doesn't even exist at c,this is definitely not going to be continuous.And this matches up to our expectationswith our little do-we-have-to-pick-up-the-pencil test.If I have to draw this, I can leave my pencil,it's on the paper, it's on the paper,it's on the paper, it's on the paper.How am I going to continue to draw this function,this graph of the function, without picking up my pencil?Pick it up, put it back down, and then keep drawing it.And so once again, this right over here is not continuous.Both intuitively, by our pick-up-the-pencil definition,and also by this more rigorous definition where,in this case the limit,the two-sided limit at x equals c doesn't even exist,so we're definitely not gonna be continuous.But even when the two-sided limit does exist,but the limit is a different valuethan the value of the function,that will also not be continuous.The only situation that it's going to be continuousis if the two-sided limit approaches the same valueas the value of the function.And if that's true, then we're continuous.If we're continuous, that is going to be true.

work through this on your own.So let's look at this first statement.So this first statement says both the limit of g of xas x approaches six from the right-hand sideand the limit as x approaches six from the left-hand sideof g of x exist.All right, so let's first think about the limitof g of x as x approaches six from the right-hand side,as we approach six from values greater than six.So if we look over here, we could say okay,when x is equal to nine, and g of nine is right over there,g of eight is right over here,g of seven is right over here,looks like it's between negative three and negative four,g of 6.5 looks like it's a little bit,it's still between negative three and negative fourbut it's closer to negative three.G of 6.1 is even closer to negative three.G of 6.01 is even closer to negative three,so it looks like the limitfrom the right-hand side does exist.So it looks like this one exists.Now let's see, and I'm just looking at it graphically.That's all they can expect you to doin an exercise like this.Now let's think about the limit as x approaches sixfrom the left-hand side.So I could start anywhere, but let's say when x is equalto three, g of three is a little more than one.G of four looks like there's a little bit less than two.G of five looks like it's close to three.G of 5.5 looks like it's between five and six.G of 5.75 looks like it's approaching nine.And as we get closer and closer,as x gets closer and closer to six from below,from values to the left of six,it looks like we're unbounded, we're approaching infinity.And so technically, we would say this limit does not exist.So this one does not exist.So I won't check this one off.Some people say the limit is approaching infinity,but that technically is,infinity is not a value that you can sayit is approaching in the classical formal definitionof a limit.So for these purposes, we would just saythis does not exist.Now let's see, they say the limit as x approaches sixof g of x exists.Well, the only way that the limit existsis if both the left, if both the left, the left,and the right limits exist and they approach the same thing.We'll, our limit as x approaches six from the negative sideor from the left-hand side, I guess I could say,does not even exist.So this cannot be true.So that's not gonna be true.The first one's not gonna be true.G is defined as x equals six.So at x equals six, it doesn't look like g is defined.Looking at this graph, I can't tell youwhat g of six should be.We have an open circle over here, so g of sixdoes not equal to negative three,and this goes up to infinity,and we have a vertical asymptote actually drawnright over here at x equals six.So g is not defined at x equals six.So I'll rule that one out.G is continuous at x equals six.Well, you can see that it goes up to infinitythen it jumps down, back down here, then it continues.So when you just think about it in commonsense language,it looks very discontinuous.And if you wanna think about it more formally,in order for something to be continuous,the limit needs to exist at that value.The function needs to be defined at that value,and the value of the function needs to be equalto the value of the limitand neither of these, the first two conditions are trueand so these can't even equal each other because neitherof these exist.So this is not continuous at x equals sixand so the only think I can check here is none of the above.Let's do another one of these.So the first statement, both the right-handand the left-hand limit exists as x approaches three.So let's think about it.So x equals three is where we have this littlediscontinuity here, this jump discontinuity.So let's approach, let's go from the positive,from values larger than three.So when x is equal to five, g of five is a little bitmore negative than negative three.G of four is between negative two and negative three.G of 3.5 is getting a bit closer to negative two.G of 3.1, it's getting even closer,closer to negative two.G of 3.01 is even closer to negative two.So it looks like this limit right over here,well, I'm circling the wrong one,it looks like this limit exists.In fact, it looks like it is approaching negative two.So this right over here is equal to negative two.The limit of g of x as x approaches threefrom the right-hand side,and I'll just think about it from the left-hand side.So I can start here.G of one, looks like it's a little bitgreater than negative one.G of two, it's less than one.G of 2.5 is between one and two.G of 2.9 looks like it's a little bit less than two.G of 2.99 is getting even closer to two.G of 2.99999 would be even closer to twoso it looks like this thing right over hereis approaching two.So both of these limits, the limit from the rightand the limit from the left exist.The limit of g of x as x approaches three exists.So these are the one-sided limit.This is the actual limit.Now in order for this to exist, both the rightand left-handed limits need to existand they need to approach the same value.Well, this first statement,we saw that both of these exist but they aren't approachingthe same value.From the left, we are, or sorry,from the right, we are approaching,we are approaching negative two.And from the left, we are approaching two.So this limit does not exist.So I will not check that out or I will not check that box.G is defined at x equals three.Well, when x equals three, we see a solid dotright over there.And so it is indeed defined.It is indeed defined there.G is continuous at x equals three.Well, in order for g to be continuous at x equals three,the limit must exist there.It must be defined there,and the value of the function thereneeds to be equal to the value of the limit.Well, the function is defined there,but the limit doesn't exist thereso it cannot be continuous.It cannot be continuous there.So I would cross that out.And I can't click, I wouldn't click none of the abovebecause I've already checked something,or I've actually checked two things already.

videois explore continuity over an interval.But to do that, let's refresh our memoryabout continuity at a point.So we say that fis continuouswhenx is equal to c,if and only if,so I'm gonna make these two-way arrows right over here,the limitof f of xas x approaches cis equal to f of c.And when we first introduced this,we said, hey, this looks a little bit technical,but it's actually pretty intuitive.Think about what's happening.The limit as x approaches c of f of x,so let's say that f of x as x approaches cis approaching some value.So if we approach,if we approach from the left,we're getting to this value.If we approach from the right, we're getting this value.Well, in order for the function to be continuous,if I had to draw this function without picking up my pen,well, the value of the function at that pointshould be the same as the limit.This is really just a more rigorous way of describingthis notion of not having to pick up your pencil,this notion of connectedness,that you don't have any jumpsor any discontinuities of any kind.So with that out the way,let's discuss continuity over intervals.Let me delete this really fast,so I have space to work with.So we say, so I'm gonna first talk about an open interval,and then we're gonna talk about a closed intervalbecause a closed interval gets a little bit more involved.So we say fis continuousover an open interval from a to b.So the parentheses instead of brackets,this shows that we're not including the endpoint.So this would be all of the points between x equals aand x equals b,but not equaling x equals a and x equals b.So f is continuous over this open interval,if and only if,if and only if,f is continuous,f is continuousoverevery point in,over every pointinthe interval.So let's do a couple of examples of that.So let's say we're talking about the open intervalfrom negative sevento negative five.Is f continuous over that interval?Let's see, we're going from negative sevento negative five,and there's a couple of ways you could do it.There's the not-so-mathematically-rigorous way,where you could say, hey, look, if I start here,I can get all the way to negative fivewithout having to pick up my pencil.If you wanted to do more rigorouslyand you actually had the definition of the function,you might be able to do a proof,that for any of these points over the interval,that the limit as x approaches any one of these pointsof f of x is equal to the value of the functionat that point.It's harder to do when you only have a graph.When you only have a graph,you can only just do it by inspection,and say, okay, I can go from that point to that pointwithout picking up my pencil,so I feel pretty good about it.Now let's do another interval.Let's say the, so let me put a check mark here,that is continuous.Let's think about the interval from negative twoto positive one, the open interval.So this is interesting because the functionat negative two is up here.And so if you really wanted to start at negative two,you would have to start here and then jump immediately downas soon as you get slightly larger than negative twoand then keep going.But this is an open interval,so we're not actually concernedwith what exactly happens at negative two,we're concerned what happens when we areall the numbers larger than negative two.So we would actually start right over here,and then we would go to one.And once again, based on the intuitiveI didn't have to pick up my pen idea,this function would be continuousover this,over this interval.So what's an example of an intervalwhere the function would not be continuous?Well, think about the interval from,well, this is a pretty straightforward one,the open interval from three to five.The function is here when x is equal to three.But if we wanted to get to five,it looks like we're asymptoting,it looks like we're asymptoting up towards infinityand we just keep on going for a very long time.And then we would have to pick up our pencil and jump over,and then we would come back down right over here.And so here we are not continuous over that interval.So now let's think about the more,the slightly more involved interval.The slightly more involved caseis when you have a closed interval.F is continuousover the closed interval from a to b.So this includes not just the points between a and b,but the endpoints as well,if and only if,f iscontinuousover the open intervaland the one-sided limits.Let me right this.Andthe limitas x approaches afrom the rightof f of xis equal to f of a,and the limitas x approaches bfrom the left,from the left of f of xis equal to f of b.Now what's going on here?Well, it's just saying that the one-sided limit,when you're operating within the Interval,has to approach the same value as the function.So for example, if we said the closed intervalfrom negative seven to negative five,well, this one is still reasonable,you know, just based on the picking up your pencil thing.You don't have to pick up your pencil.And what you would do is at the endpoint,and at negative seven,this function is just plain old continuous,but if it wasn't defined over here,it could still be continuous because you would dothe right-handed limit towards it.And you'd say, okay, the right-handed limitis equal to the value of the function.And then at this endpoint, at the second endpoint,you'd say, okay, the left-handed limitis equal to the function, even if it wasn't defined here,even if the two-sided limit were not defined.And so we could actually look at an example of that.If we were looking atthe interval from the closed,and you could have one side open, one side closed,but let's just do the closed interval from negative threeto negative two.So notice I did not have to pick up my pencil.I'm including negative three,and I'm getting all the way to negative two.If you knew the analytic definition of this function,you could prove that, hey, the limit at any of these pointsinside, between negative three and negative two,is equal to the value of the function.Negative three, the function is clearly, at negative three,the function is just plain old continuous.The two-sided limit approaches the value of the function.But at negative two, the two-sided limit does not exist.When you approach from the left,it looks like you're approaching zero.F of x is equal to zero.When you approach from the right,it looks like f of x is approaching negative three.So even though the two-sided limit does not exist,we can still be goodbecause the left-handed limit does exist.And the left-handed limit is approachingthe value of the function.So we actually are continuous over that interval.But then if we did the interval,if we did the closed interval from negative two tonegative two to one,pause the video and think about,based on what we just talked about,are we continuous over this interval?Well, we're going from negative twoto one,and negative two is the lower bound.So is this right over here,is this right over here true?Is the limit as we approach negative two from the right,is that the same thing as f of negative two?Well, the limit as we approach from the rightseems to be approaching negative three,and f of negative two is zero.So this limit does not, this, this,these two things, the limit as we approach from the rightand the value of the function are not the same.And so we do not have that, I guess you could saythat one-sided (laughs) continuity at negative two.And that also makes sense.If I start at negative two,let me do this in a color you can see,if I start at negative twoand I want to go the rest of the interval to one,I have to pick up my pencil.Pick up my pencil, go here, and then keep on going.So this is, we are not continuous over that interval.

over one minus cosine of x minus two,and they ask us to select the correct descriptionof the one-sided limits of f at x equals two.And we see that right at x equals two,if we try to evaluate f of two,we get two over one minus cosineof two minus two,which is the same thing as cosine of zero,and cosine of zero is just one,and so one minus one is zero,and so the function is not defined at x equals two,and that's why it might be interesting to find the limitas x approaches two, and especially the one-sided limit.And the one-sided limit.Well, we'll obviously leave it at thatso let's try to approach this.So there's actually a couple of ways you could do it.There is one way you could do this without a calculatorby just inspecting what's going on here,and thinking about the properties of the cosine function,and if that inspires you, pause the video and work it out,and I will do that at the end of this video.The other way, if you have a calculatoris to do it with a little bit of a tablelike we've done in other example problems.So if we think about x approaching twofrom the positive direction, well then.We can make a little table herewhere you have x, and then you have f of x.And so for approaching two from values greater than two,you could have 2.1,2.01.Now the reason why I said calculators,these aren't trivial to evaluatebecause this would be what, 2.1over 1 minus cosine of,2.1 minus two is 0.1.I do not know what cosine of 0.1 is without a calculator.I do know that cosine of zero is oneso this is very, very close to one without getting to one,and it's going to be less than one.Cosine is never going to be greater than one.The cosine function is bounded between negative oneis less than cosine of x.I'll just write the x, then I don't need the parenthesis.Which is less than one.The cosine function just oscillates between these two valuesso this, this thing is gonna be approaching onebut it's going to be less than one.It definitely cannot be greater than one,and that's actually a good hintfor how you can just explore the structure here,and then you could say, ""All right, 2.01.""Well, that's going to be 2.01""over one minus""cosine of 0.01.""And this is going to even closer to onewithout being one but it's going to be less than one.No matter what, cosine of anythingis going to be between negative one and one,and it could even be including those thingsbut as we approach two,this thing is going to approach one,I guess you could say approach one from below.And so you can start to make some intuitions here.If it's approaching from below, this thing over here,this whole expression is going to be positive,and as we approach x equals two.Well, the numerator is positive.It's approaching two.The denominator is positive so this whole thinghas to be approaching a positive valueor it could become unboundedin the positive direction as we'll see,this is unbounded because this thingis even closer to one than this thing,and you would see that if you have a calculatorbut needless to say, this is going to be unboundedin the positive direction so we're going to be goingtowards positive infinity so these two choices have that,and we can make the exact same argument as we approach xin the negative or from below,as we approach two from below, I should say.So that's x, and that is f of x,and once again, I don't have a calculator in front of me.You could evaluate these things at a calculator,and become very clear that these are positive,and as we get closer to,they become even larger and larger positive values,and the same thing would happen if you did 1.9,and if you did 1.99because here, you'd be 1.9 over one minus cosine.Now here, you'd have 1.9 minus twoso this would be negative 0.1.Let me scroll over a little bit.The second one would be 1.99over one minus cosineof negative 0.01.And cosine of negative 0.1is the same thing as cosine of 0.1.Cosine of negative 0.01is the same thing as cosine of 0.01.So these two things, this is going to be equal to that.That is going to be equal to that.And once again, we're gonna be approaching positive infinityso the only choice where all of that is trueis this first one.Whether we approach two from the right-hand sideor the left-hand side, we're approaching positive infinitybut the other way you could have deduced that is say,""Okay, as we approach two,the numerator is going to be positive'cause two is positive, and then over here,as we approach two,cosine of anything can never be greater than one.It's going to approach one but be less than oneso if this is less than as x approaches two.It becomes one when x is equal to two.Well then, this right over here,one minus something less than one is going to be positiveso you have a positive divided by a positiveso you're definitely going to get positive valuesas you approach two.And we know, and they've already told usthat these are going to be unbounded based on the choicesso you would also pick thatbut you should also feel good about it,that the closer that we get to two,the closer that this value right over here gets to zero.And the closer that this value gets to zero,the closer we get to one.The closer we get to one, the smaller the denominator gets.And then you divide by smaller and smaller denominators,you're going to become unbounded towards infinity,which is exactly what we see in that first choice."

There you go.I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.That's not the color I wanted to use.So it might look something like that.We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and largerand then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.I'm not drawing it so well.So that right over there is y=f(x).And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more pointsor using some type of graphing calculator or something.But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinityand we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominateas x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptotein the positive direction and this one in the negative.

videois the intermediate value theorem.Which, despite some of this mathy language you'll seeis one of the more intuitive theoremspossibly the most intuitive theorem you willcome across in a lot of yourmathematical career.So first I'll just read it outand then I'll interpret it and hopefullywe'll all appreciate that it's pretty obvious.I'm not going to prove it here.But, I think the conceptual underpinning here isit should be straightforward.So the theorem tells us that suppose F is a functioncontinuous at every point of the intervalthe closed interval, so we're including A and B.So it's continuous at every point of the interval A, B.Let me just draw a couple of examplesof what F could look like justbased on these first lines.Suppose F is a function continuous at every pointof the interval A, B.So let me draw some axes here.So that's my Y axis.And this is my X axis.So, one situationif this is A.And this is B.F is continuous at every point of the intervalof the closed interval A and B.So that means it's got to be for sure definedat every point.As well, as to be continuous you haveto defined at every point.And the limit of the function that is recorded at that pointshould be equal to the value of the function of that point.And so the function is definitely going to be definedat F of A.So it's definitely going to have an F of Aright over here.That's right over hereis F of A.Maybe F of B is higher.Although we can look at different cases.So that would be our F of B.And they tell us it is a continuous function.It is a continuous function.So if you're trying to imagine continuous functionsone way to think about it isif we're continuous over an intervalwe take the value of the function atone point of the interval.And, if it's continuous we need to be able toget to the other, the value of the functionat the other point of the intervalwithout picking up our pencil.So, I can do all sorts of thingsand it still has to be a function.So, I can't do something like that.But,as long as I don't pick up my pencilthis is a continuous function.So, there you go.If the somehow the graphI had to pick up my pencil.If I had to do something like thisoops, I got to pick up my pencil do something like that,well that's not continuous anymore.If I had to do something like thisand oops, pick up my pencilnot continuous anymore.If I had to do something likewooo.Whoa, okay, pick up my pencil, go down here,not continuous anymore.So, this is what a continuous functionthat a function that is continuousover the closed interval A, B looks like.I can draw some other examples, in fact,let me do that.So let me drawone.Maybe where F of B is less thanF of A.So it's my Y axis.And this is myX axis.And once again, A and B don't bothhave to be positive,they can both be negative.One could be, A could be negative.B could be positive.And maybe in this situation.And F of A and F of Bit could also be a positive or negative.But let's take a situation where this isF of A.So that, right over there,is F of A.This right over hereis F of B.F of B.And once again we're saying F is acontinuous function.So I should be able to go from F of Ato F of BF of B draw a functionwithout having to pick up my pencil.So it could do something like this.Actually I want to make it go vertical.It could go like thisand then go down.And thendo somethinglike that.So these are both casesand I could draw an infinite number of caseswhere F is a function continuous at every pointof the interval.The closed interval, from A to B.Now, given thatthere's two ways to state the conclusionfor the intermediate value theorem.You'll see it written in one of these waysor something close to one of these ways.And that's why I included both of these.So one way to say it is, wellif this first statement is truethen F will take on every valuebetween F of A and F of Bover the interval.And you see in both of these casesevery interval, sorry, everyevery value between F of Aand F of B.So every value hereis being taken on at some point.You can pick some value.You can pick some value, an arbitrary valueL, right over here.Oh look.L happened right over there.If you pick Lwell, L happened right over there.And actually it also happened thereand it also happened there.And this second bullet point describesthe intermediate value theorem more that way.For any L between the values of F and Aand F of Bthere are exists a number Cin the closed interval from A to Bfor which F of C equals L.So there exists at least one C.So in this casethat would be our C.Over here, there's potentialthere's multiple candidates for C.That could be a candidate for C.That could be a C.So we could say there exists at leastone number.At leastone number, I'll throw that in there,at least one number Cin the interval for which this is true.And, something that might amuse youfor a few minutes istry to draw a function where this firststatement is true.But somehow the second statement isnot true.So, you say, okay, well let's saylet's assume that there's an Lwhere there isn't a C in the interval.Let me try and do that.And I'll draw it big so thatwe can really see how obviousthat we have to take onall of the values between F and Aand F of B is.So,let me draw a big axis this time.So that's my Y axis.And,that is my X axis.And I'll just do the case wherejust for simplicity, that is Aand that is B.And let's saythat this is F of A.So that isF of A.And let's say that thisis F of B.Little dotted line.All right.F of B.And we assume that wewe have a continuous function here.So the graph, I could draw it fromF of A to F of B from this pointto this pointwithout picking up my pencil.From this coordinate A comma F of Ato this coordinate B comma F of Bwithout picking up my pencil.Well, let's assumethat there is some L that we don't take on.Let's say there's some value L right over here.And,and we never take on this value.This continuous function never takes on this valueas we go from X equaling A to X equal B.Let's see if I can draw that.Let's see if I can getfrom hereto herewithout ever essentially crossing this dotted line.Well let's see, I could, wooo,maybe I would a little bit.But gee, how am I gonna get there?Well, without picking up my pencil.Well,well, I really need to cross that line,all right.Well, there you go.I found, we took on the value Land it happened at Cwhich is in that closed interval.So once again, I'm not giving you a proof here.But hopefully you have a good intuitionthat the intermediate value theoremis kind of common sense.The key is you're dealing with a continuous function.If you make its graphif you were to draw it betweenthe coordinates A comma F of Aand B comma F of Band you don't pick up your pencil,which would be true of a continuous function.Well, it's going to take on every valuebetween F of A and F of B.

picture of Isaac Newton,super famous British mathematician and physicist.This is a picture of a Gottfried Leibnitz,super famous, or maybe not as famous,but maybe should be, famous German philosopherand mathematician, and he was a contemporary of Isaac Newton.These two gentlemen together were reallythe founding fathers of calculus.And they did some of their-- most of their major workin the late 1600s.And this right over here is Usain Bolt, Jamaican sprinter,whose continuing to do some of his best work in 2012.And as of early 2012, he's the fastest human alive,and he's probably the fastest human that has ever lived.And you might have not made the association with these threegentleman.You might not think that they have a lot in common.But they were all obsessed with the same fundamental question.And this is the same fundamental questionthat differential calculus addresses.And the question is, what is the instantaneous rateof change of something?And in the case of Usain Bolt, how fast is he going right now?Not just what his average speed was for the last second,or his average speed over the next 10 seconds.How fast is he going right now?And so this is what differential calculus is all about.Instantaneous rates of change.Differential calculus.Newton's actual original term for differential calculuswas the method of fluxions, whichactually sounds a little bit fancier.But it's all about what's happening in this instant.And to think about why that is not a super easy problemto address with traditional algebra, let'sdraw a little graph here.So on this axis I'll have distance.I'll say y is equal to distance.I could have said d is equal to distance,but we'll see, especially later on in calculus,d is reserved for something else.We'll say y is equal to distance.And in this axis, we'll say time.And I could say t is equal to time,but I'll just say x is equal to time.And so if we were to plot Usain Bolt's distanceas a function of time, well at time zerohe hasn't gone anywhere.He is right over there.And we know that this gentleman iscapable of traveling 100 meters in 9.58 seconds.So after 9.58 seconds, we'll assumethat this is in seconds right over here,he's capable of going 100 meters.And so using this information, wecan actually figure out his average speed.Let me write it this way, his average speedis just going to be his change in distanceover his change in time.And using the variables that are over here,we're saying y is distance.So this is the same thing as changein y over change in x from this point to that point.And this might look somewhat familiar to youfrom basic algebra.This is the slope between these two points.If I have a line that connects these two points,this is the slope of that line.The change in distance is this right over here.Change in y is equal to 100 meters.And our change in time is this right over here.So our change in time is equal to 9.58 seconds.We started at 0, we go to 9.58 seconds.Another way to think about it, the rise over the run you mighthave heard in your algebra class.It's going to be 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.So this is 100 meters over 9.58 seconds.And the slope is essentially just rate of change,or you could view it as the average rateof change between these two points.And you'll see, if you even just follow the units,it gives you units of speed here.It would be velocity if we also specified the direction.And we can figure out what that is,let me get the calculator out.So let me get the calculator on the screen.So we're going 100 meters in the 9.58 seconds.So it's 10.4, I'll just write 10.4, I'll round to 10.4.So it's approximately 10.4, and then the unitsare meters per second.And that is his average speed.And what we're going to see in a secondis how average speed is differentthan instantaneous speed.How it's different than what the speedhe might be going at any given moment.And just to have a concept of how fast this is,let me get the calculator back.This is in meters per second.If you wanted to know how many meters he's going in an hour,well there's 3,600 seconds in an hour.So he'll be able to go this many meters 3,600 times.So that's how many meters he can,if he were able to somehow keep up that speed in an hour.This is how fast he's going meters per hour.And then, if you were to say how many miles per hour,there's roughly 1600-- and I don't know the exact number,but roughly 1600 meters per mile.So let's divide it by 1600.And so you see that this is roughly a little over 23,about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.So this is approximately, and I'llwrite it this way-- this is approximately 23.5 milesper hour.And relative to a car, not so fast.But relative to me, extremely fast.Now to see how this is different than instantaneous velocity,let's think about a potential plot of his distancerelative to time.He's not going to just go this speed immediately.He's not just going to go as soon as the gun fires,he's not just going to go 23 and 1/2 miles per hour all the way.He's going to accelerate.So at first he's going to start off going a little bit slower.So the slope is going to be a little bit lot lowerthan the average slope.He's going to go a little bit slower,then he's going to start accelerating.And so his speed, and you'll see the slope hereis getting steeper and steeper and steeper.And then maybe near the end he starts tiring off a little bit.And so his distance plotted against timemight be a curve that looks something like this.And what we calculated here is justthe average slope across this change in time.What we could see at any given momentthe slope is actually different.In the beginning, he has a slower rateof change of distance.Then over here, then he accelerates over here,it seems like his rate of change of distance, whichwould be roughly-- or you could view itas the slope of the tangent line at that point,it looks higher than his average.And then he starts to slow down again.When you average it out, it gets to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.And I looked it up, Usain Bolt's instantaneous velocity,his peak instantaneous velocity, is actuallycloser to 30 miles per hour.So the slope over here might be 23 whatever miles per hour.But the instantaneous, his fastest pointin this 9.58 seconds is closer to 30 miles per hour.But you see it's not a trivial thing to do.You could say, OK, let me try to approximate the slope rightover here.And you could do that by saying, OK, well,what is the change in y over the change of x right around this?So you could say, well, let me take some change of x,and figure out what the change of y is around it,or as we go past that.So you get that.But that would just be an approximation,because you see that the slope of this curveis constantly changing.So what you want to do is see whathappens as your change of x gets smallerand smaller and smaller.As your change of x get smaller and smaller and smaller,you're going to get a better and better approximation.Your change of y is going to get smallerand smaller and smaller.So what you want to do, and we'regoing to go into depth into all of this,and study it more rigorously, is youwant to take the limit as delta x approaches0 of your change in y over your change in x.And when you do that, you're goingto approach that instantaneous rate of change.You could view it as the instantaneous slopeat that point in the curve.Or the slope of the tangent line at that point in the curve.Or if we use calculus terminology,we would view that as the derivative.So the instantaneous slope is the derivative.And the notation we use for the derivative is a dy over dx.And that's why I reserved the letter y.And then you say, well, how does thisrelate to the word differential?Well, the word differential is relating--this dy is a differential, dx is a differential.And one way to conceptualize it, thisis an infinitely small change in yover an infinitely small change in x.And by getting super, super small changes in yover change in x, you're able to get your instantaneous slope.Or in the case of this example, the instantaneous speedof Usain Bolt right at that moment.And notice, you can't just put a 0 here.If you just put change in x is zero,you're going to get something that's undefined.You can't divide by 0.So we take the limit as it approaches 0.And we'll define that more rigorouslyin the next few videos.

are likely already familiar with the ideaof a slope of a line.If you're not, I encourage you to review it on Khan Academy,but all it is, it's describing the rate of changeof a vertical variablewith respect to a horizontal variable,so for example, here I have our classic y axisin the vertical direction and x axisin the horizontal direction,and if I wanted to figure out the slope of this line,I could pick two points,say that point and that point.I could say, ""Okay, from this point to this point,what is my change in x?""Well, my change in x would be this distance right over here,change in x,the Greek letter delta, this triangle here.It's just shorthand for ""change,"" so change in x,and I could also calculate the change in y,so this point going up to that point, our change in y,would be this, right over here, our change in y,and then, we would define slope, or we have defined slopeas change in y over change in x,so slope is equal to the rate of changeof our vertical variableover the rate of change of our horizontal variable,sometimes described as rise over run,and for any line, it's associated with a slopebecause it has a constant rate of change.If you took any two points on this line,no matter how far apart or no matter how close together,anywhere they sit on the line,if you were to do this calculation,you would get the same slope.That's what makes it a line,but what's fascinatingabout calculus is we're going to build the toolsso that we can think about the rate of change not justof a line, which we've called ""slope"" in the past,we can think about the rate of change,the instantaneous rate of change of a curve,of something whose rateof change is possibly constantly changing.So for example, here's a curve where the rate of change of ywith respect to x is constantly changing,even if we wanted to use our traditional tools.If we said, ""Okay, we can calculate the average rateof change,"" let's say between this point and this point.Well, what would it be?Well, the average rate of change between this point andthis point would be the slope of the linethat connects them,so it would be the slope of this line of the secant line,but if we picked two different points,we pick this point and this point,the average rate of changebetween those points all of a sudden looks quite different.It looks like it has a higher slope.So even when we take the slopes between two pointson the line, the secant lines,you can see that those slopes are changing,but what if we wanted to ask ourselvesan even more interesting question.What is the instantaneous rate of change at a point?So for example, how fast is y changingwith respect to x exactly at that point,exactly when x is equal to that value.Let's call it x one.Well, one way you could think about it iswhat if we could draw a tangent line to this point,a line that just touches the graph right over there,and we can calculate the slope of that line?Well, that should be the rate of change at that point,the instantaneous rate of change.So in this case,the tangent line might look something like that.If we know the slope of this,well then we could say thatthat's the instantaneous rate of change at that point.Why do I say instantaneous rate of change?Well, think about the video on these sprinters,Usain Bolt example.If we wanted to figure out the speed of Usain Boltat a given instant, well maybe this describes his positionwith respect to time if y was position and x is time.Usually, you would see t as time, but let's say x is time,so then, if were talking about right at this time,we're talking about the instantaneous rate,and this idea is the central idea of differential calculus,and it's known as a derivative,the slope of the tangent line, which you could also viewas the instantaneous rate of change.I'm putting an exclamation markbecause it's so conceptually important here.So how can we denote a derivative?One way is known as Leibniz's notation,and Leibniz is one of the fathers of calculusalong with Isaac Newton,and his notation, you would denote the slopeof the tangent lineas equaling dy over dx.Now why do I like this notation?Because it really comes from this idea of a slope,which is change in y over change in x.As you'll see in future videos,one way to think about the slopeof the tangent line is, well,let's calculate the slope of secant lines.Let's say between that point and that point,but then let's get even closer,say that point and that point,and then let's get even closerand that point and that point,and then let's get even closer,and let's see what happens as the changein x approaches zero,and so using these d's instead of deltas,this was Leibniz's way of saying,""Hey, what happens if my changesin, say, x become close to zero?""So this idea,this is known as sometimes differential notation,Leibniz's notation, is instead of just changein y over change in x, super small changes in yfor a super small change in x,especially as the change in x approaches zero,and as you will see,that is how we will calculate the derivative.Now, there's other notations.If this curve is described as y is equal to f of x.The slope of the tangent lineat that point could be denotedas equaling f prime of x one.So this notation takes a little bit of time getting used to,the Lagrange notation.It's saying f prime is representing the derivative.It's telling us the slope of the tangent linefor a given point,so if you input an x into this function into f,you're getting the corresponding y value.If you input an x into f prime,you're getting the slope of the tangent line at that point.Now, another notation that you'll see less likelyin a calculus class but you might see in a physics classis the notation y with a dot over it,so you could write this is y with a dot over it,which also denotes the derivative.You might also see y prime.This would be more common in a math class.Now as we march forward in our calculus adventure,we will build the tools to actually calculate these things,and if you're already familiar with limits,they will be very useful, as you could imagine,'cause we're really going to be taking the limitof our change in y over change in x as our changein x approaches zero,and we're not just going to be able to figure it outfor a point.We're going to be able to figure out general equationsthat described the derivative for any given point,so be very, very excited."

What I wanna do in this videois a few examples that test our intuitionof the derivative as a rate of changeor the steepness of a curveor the slope of a curveor the slope of a tangent line of a curvedepending on how you actually want to think about it.So here it says F prime of fiveso this notation, primethis is another way of saying well what's the derivativelet's estimate the derivative of our function at five.And when we say F prime of five this is the slopeslope of tangent linetangent line at fiveor you could view it as theyou could view it as the rate of changeof Y with respect to Xwhich is really how we define sloperespect to X of our function F.So let's think about that a little bit.We see they put the pointthe point five comma F of five right over hereand so if we want to estimate the slope of the tangent lineif we want to estimate the steepness of this curvewe could try to draw a linethat is tangent right at that point.So let me see if I can do that.So if I were to draw a line starting thereif I just wanted to make a tangentit looks like it would do something like that.Right at that point that looks to beabout how steep that curve isnow what makes this an interesting thing in non-linearis that it's constantly changingthe steepness it's very low here and it gets steeperand steeper and steeper as we move to the rightfor larger and larger X values.But if we look at the point in questionwhen X is equal to five remember F prime of fivewould be if you were estimating itthis would be the slope of this line here.And the slope of this line it looks likefor every time we move one in the X directionwe're moving two in the Y direction.Delta Y is equal to two when delta X is equal to one.So our change in Ywith respect to Xat least for this tangent line herewhich would represent our change in Ywith respect to X right at that pointis going to be equal to two over one, or two.And it's almost estimated, but all of these are way off.Having a negative two derivativewould mean that as we increase our X our Y is decreasing.So if our curve looks something like thiswe would have a slope of negative two.If having slopes in thisa positive of point onethat would be very flat something down herewe might have a slope closer to point one.Negative point one that might be closer on this sidenow we're sloping but very close to flat.A slope of zero, that would be right over here at the bottomwhere right at that moment as we change XY is not increasing or decreasingthe slope of the tangent line right at that bottom pointwould have a slope of zero.So I feel really good about that response.Let's do one more of these.So alright, so they're telling us to comparethe derivative of G at four to the derivative of G at sixand which of these is greaterand like always, pause the videoand see if you can figure this out.Well this is just an exerciselet's see if we were toif we were to make a line that indicates the slope thereyou can do this as a tangent linelet me try to do that.So now that wouldn't, that doesn't do a good jobso right over here atthat looks like aI think I can do a better job than thatno that's too shallow to seenot shallow's not the word, that's too flat.So let me try to reallyokay, that looks pretty good.So that line that I just drewseems to be indicative ofthe rate of change of Y with respect to Xor the slope of that curveor that line you can view it as a tangent lineso we could think about what its slope is going to beand then if we go further down over herethis one is, it looks like it issteeper but in the negative directionso it looks like it is steeper for surebut it's in the negative direction.As we increase, think of it this wayas we increase X one hereit looks like we are decreasing Y by about one.So it looks like G prime of fourG prime of four, the derivative when X is equal to fouris approximately, I'm estimating itnegative onewhile the derivative here when we increase Xif we increase X byif we increase X by oneit looks like we're decreasing Y by close to threeso G prime of sixlooks like it's closer to negative three.So which one of these is larger?Well, this one is less negativeso it's going to be greater than the other oneand you could have done this intuitivelyif you just look at the curvethis is some type of a sinusoid hereyou have right over here the curve is flatyou have right at that momentyou have no change in Y with respect to Xthen it starts to decreasethen it decreases at an even faster ratethen it decreases at a faster ratethen it starts, it's still decreasingbut it's decreasing at slower and slower ratesdecreasing at slower rates and right at that momentyou have your slope of your tangent line is zerothen it starts to increase, increase, so on and so forthand it just keeps happening over and over again.So you can also think about this in a more intuitive way.

[Voiceover] We're told that the tangent line to the graphof function at the the point two comma threepasses through the point seven comma six.Find f prime of two.So whenever you see something like this,it doesn't hurt to try to visualize it.You might want to draw it out or just visualize itin your headbut since you can't get in my head,I will draw it out.So let medraw the information that they are giving us.So that's x axis and that is the y axis.Let's see the relevant points here at two comma threeand seven comma six.So let me go,one, two, three, four,five, six, seven, along the x axisand I'm going to go one, two, three, four,five, and six, along the y axis.And now this point,so we have the point two comma three,so let me mark that,so two comma three is right over there,so that's two comma three and we also havethe point seven comma six.Seven comma six is going to be right over there.Seven comma six.Let us remind ourselves what they're saying.They're saying the tangent line to the graph of function fat this pointpasses through the point seven comma six.So if it's the tangent line to the graph at that point,it must go through two comma three,that's the only place where it intersects our graphand it goes through seven comma six.We only need two points to define a lineand so the tangent line is going to look like,it's going to look like,let me see if I can,no that's not right.Let me draw itlike it's going to look.Oh that's not exactly right.Let me try one more time.Okay, there you go.So the tangent line is going to look like that.It goes, it's tangent two f right at two comma threeand it goes through the point seven comma sixand so we don't know anything other than fbut we can imagine what f looks like.Our function f could,so our function f,it could look something like this.It just has to be tangentso that line has to be tangent to our functionright at that point.So our function f could look something like that.So when they say, find f prime of two,they're really saying,what is the slope of thetangent line when x is equal to two?So when x is equal to two,well the slope of the tangent lineis the slope of this line.They gave us, they gave us the two points that siton the tangent line.So we just have to figure out its slopebecause that is going to be the rate of change ofthat function right over there,its derivative.It's going to be the slope of the tangent linebecause this is the tangent line.So let's do that.So as we know,slope is change in y over change in x.So if we change our,to go from two comma three to seven comma six,our change in x,change in x,we go from x equals two to x equals 7so our change in x is equal to five.And our change in y,our change in y,we go from y equals three to y equals six.So our change in y is equal to three.So our change in y over change in xis going to be three over fivewhich is the slope of this line,which is the derivative of the function at twobecause this is the tangent line at x equals two.Let's do another one of these.For a function g,we are given that g of negative one equals threeand g prime of negative one is equal to negative two.What is the equation of the tangent line to the graph of gat x equals negative one?Alright, so once againI think it will be helpful to graph this.Sowe have our y axis,we have our x axisand let's see.We say for function g we are given that g of negative oneis equal to three.So the point negative one comma three is on our function.So this is negative one and then we have,one,two,and three.So that's that right over there.That is the point.That is the point negative one comma three,it's going to be on our function.And we also know that g prime of negative oneis equal to negative two.So the slope of the tangent lineright at that point on our functionis going to be negative two.That's what that tells us.The slope of the tangent line,when x is equal to negative one is equal to negative two.So I could use that informationto actually draw the tangent line.So let me see if I can,let me see if I can do this.So it will look,so I think it will,let me just draw it like this.So it's going to go,so it's a slope of negative twois going to look something like that.So as we can see if we move positive one in the x direction,we godown two in the y direction.So that is a slope of negative two.And so you might say well, where is g?Well we could draw what g could look like.G might look something like this.Might look something like that right over therewhere that is the tangent lineor you can make g do all sorts of crazy things after thatbut all we really care about is equationfor this green line.And there's a couple of ways that you could do this.You could say, well look a line is generally,there's a bunch of different ways where you can definethe equation for a line.You could saya line has a form y is equal to mx plus bwhere m is the slope and b is the y intercept.Well we already know what the slope of this line is.It is negative two.So we could say y is equal to negative two.Negative two times x.Times x plus b.And then to solve for b,we know that the point negative one comma threeis on this lineand this goes back to some of your Algebra Ithat you might have learned a few years ago.So let's substitute negative one and three for x and y.So when yis equal to three,so three,three is equal to,is equal to negative two,negative two times x.Times negative one,times negative one plus b.Plus b.And so let's see,this is negative two times negative one is positive two.And so if you subtract two from both sides,you get one is equal to b.And there you have it.That is equation of our line.Y is equal to negative two x plus one.And there's other ways that you could have done this,you could have written the line in point-slope formor you could have done it this way.You could have written it in standard formbut at least this is the way my brain likes to process it.

When we start dealing with non-line or non-linear curves.So let's imagine a curve that looks something like this.So what is the rate of change of ywith respect to x of this curve?Well, let's look at it at different points.And we could at least try to approximate whatit might be in any moment.So let's say that this is one point on a curve.Let's call that x1, and then this is y1.And let's say that this is another point on a curveright over here, x2.And let's call this y2.So this is a point x1, y1, this is a point x2, y2.So we don't have the tools yet.And this is what's exciting about calculus,we will soon have the tools to figure out,what is the rate of change of y with respectto x at exactly this point?But we don't have that tool yet.But using just the tools from algebra,we could at least start to think about,what is the average rate of changeover the interval from x1 to x2?Well, what's the average rate of change?Well, that's just how much did my y change--so that's my change in y-- for this change in x.And so we would calculate it the same way.y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1.So our change in y over this intervalis equal to y2 minus y1, and our changein x is going to be equal to x2 minus x1.So just like that we were able to figure outthe rate of change between these two points.Or another way of thinking about itis, this is the average rate of change for the curve between xequals x1, and x is equal to x2.This is the average rate of changeof y with respect to x over this interval.But what if we have we also figured out here?Well, we figured out the slope of the linethat connects these two points.And what we call a line that intersectsa curve in exactly two places?Well, we figured out, we call that a secant line.So this right over here is a secant line.So the big idea here is we're extending the idea of slope.We said, OK, we already knew how to find the slope of a line.A curve, we don't have the tools yet,but calculus is about to give it to us.But let's just use our algebraic tools.We can at least figure out the average rateof change of a curve, or a function, over an interval.That is the same exact thing as the slope of a secant line.Now just as a little bit of foreshadowing,where is this all going?How will we eventually get the tools, sothat we can figure out the instantaneous rate of change,not just the average?Well just imagine what happens if this point right over heregot closer and closer to this point.Then the secant line is going to better and betterand better approximate the instantaneous rateof change right over here.Or you could even think of it as the slope of the tangent line.

So I think I'm going to need my little scratchpad for this one right over here.So this is the same question over again.Now let's just try to visualize this curve right over here.So let me draw my axes.So let's say this is my y-axis.This is my y-axis, and then this is my x-axis.This is my x-axis right over here.That's my x-axis.And natural log of x-- so let's think about it a little bit.The natural log of 0, e to what power is equal to 0?Well, that's going to be 1.So you're going to have the point 1, 0 on this.So that's 1 right over there.And then the natural log of smaller and smaller numbersas we approach 0 is going to get more and more negative,all the way going down to negative infinity.So this curve is going to look something like this.It's going to look something like that.And we know it also has the point e comma 1 on it.So it has a point, the natural log of e.So if that's 1, that'll be about 2.That'll be about 3.So that is e right over here, roughly e, right over here.And that's the point e comma 1.So that's the point e comma 1 right over there.And I'll just mark that as P thereto give us a label for it.So that is P.And we want to find the secant line between Pand an arbitrary Q for any given x.The y value is going to be natural log of x.So let's say that this is our Q right over here.So let's say this right over here is our-- actually,I want to make it clear that it is a, I'll do it our here.I'm being a little indecisive.So let's say that is our Q right over there.And that's the point x natural log, natural log of x.And we want to find the slope of the secant line joiningthese two points.So this, the slope of this line, Iwant to try to make it so it doesn't look tangent,so it's secant.So you see it cuts through the curve.So that's the secant line right over there.It intersects the curve at P and at Q.So I want to find the slope of that secant line.Well, to find the slope of the secant line,I just need to find the change in yand the change in x between these two points.So what's the change in-- so let's be clear here.This is the point, this is when x is equal to-- well,it's just a kind of arbitrary x.And this right over here is the point lnx.So what is our change in x?Our change in x-- this value right over here,our change in x-- is just going to be x minus eis equal to x minus e.And what is our change in y?Our change in y is going to be lnx is goingto be the natural log of x minus 1, minus 1.That's this distance right over here.So the slope of this line, the linethat contains both of these points, the slope-- I couldwrite m for slope-- is going to be our changein y over our change in x, which is equal to lnx minus 1over x minus e.And now we can just input that and make surethat we got that right.So let me try to remember it-- lnx minus 1 over x minus e.So let me input that.So we have the natural log of x minus 1 over--and it interprets it nicely for us right below,so we make sure that we're doing over x minus e.And now let us check our answer.And we got it right.

This is essentiallythe slope of the secant line between some point x, fof x, and essentially point A. So let's draw this out.So between A and B you have a fairly negative slope.Remember we want to find the largest slope.So here it's fairly negative.Between A and C, it's less negative.Between A and D, it's even less negative.It's still negative, but it's less negative.And then between A and E, it becomes more negative now.And then between A and F, it becomes even more negative.So when is the slope of the secant line between oneof these points and A the greatest?Or I guess we could say the least negative?Because it seems like they're always negative.It would be between point D and A.So when is this greatest in value?Well, when we're looking at point D.At point D, x is equal to 6 and itlooks like f of x is like 5 and 1/2 or something.So this will turn into f of 6, which is 5 and 1/2 or maybeit's even less than that-- 5 and 1/3or something, minus 6 over 6 minus 0.That's how we'll maximize this value.This is the least negative slope of the secant line.

the idea of a slope of a line early onin our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurtsto review it a bit.So let me draw some axes.That is my y-axis.Maybe I should call it my f of x-axis.y is equal to f of x.Let me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis.And let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this.And what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do wefind the slope of that line?And what we do is, we take two points on the line,so let's say we take this point, right here.Let's say that that is the point x is equal to a.And then what would this be?This would be the point f of a, where the function isgoing to be some line.We could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b.We don't know what m and b are, but this is alla little bit of review.So this is a.And then the y-value is what happens to the function whenyou evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there.And then we could take another point on this line.Let's say we take point b, right there.And then this coordinate up here is going to bethe point b, f of b.Right?Because this is just the point when you evaluatethe function at b.You put b in here, you're going to get that point right there.So let me just draw a little line right there.So that is f of b, right there.Actually, let me make it clear that this coordinate rightis the point a, f of a.So how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or moregenerally, of this entire line?Because whole the slope is consistent thewhole way through it.And we know that once we find the slope, that'sactually going to be the value of this m.That's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it?Well, a couple of ways to think about it.Slope is equal to rise over run.You might have seen that when you first learned algebra.Or another way of writing it, it's change iny over change in x.So let's figure out what the change in why over the changein x is for this particular case.So the change in y is equal to what?Well, let's just take, you can take this guy as being thefirst point, or that guy as being the first point.But since this guy has a larger x and a larger y,let's start with him.The change in y between that guy and that guy is thisdistance, right here.So let me draw a little triangle.That distance right there is a change in y.Or I could just transfer it to the y-axis.This is the change in y.That is your change in y, that distance.So what is that distance?It's f of b minus f of a.So it equals f of b minus f of a.That is your change in y.Now what is your change in x The slope is changein y over change in x.So what our change in x?What's this distance?Remember, we're taking this to be the first point,so we took its y minus the other point's y.So to be consistent, we're going to have to take thispoint x minus this point x.So this point's x-coordinate is b.So it's going to be b minus a.And just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, orif you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would justplug them in right here and you would get your slope.That straightforward.And that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class.And let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, ifthis was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here,was the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope ofthis line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change iny, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then wedo that over 5 minus 2.Because this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so thiswould be your change in x.5 minus 2.So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so yourslope would be 4/3.Now let's see if we can generalize this.And this is what the new concept that we're goingto be learning as we delve into calculus.Let's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve.So let's say I have a curve.We have to have a curve before we can generalizeit to a curve.Let me scroll down a little.Well, actually, I want to leave this up here, showyou the similarity.Let's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now.Let's say I have a curve.I'll make it a familiar-looking curve.Let's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, whichlooks something like that.And I want to find the slope.Let's say I want to find the slope at some point.And actually, before even talking about it, let's eventhink about what it means to find the slope of a curve.Here, the slope was the same the whole time, right?But on a curve your slope is changing.And just to get an intuition for that means, is, what'sthe slope over here?Your slope over here is the slope of the tangent line.The line just barely touches it.That's the slope over there.It's a negative slope.Then over here, your slope is still negative, but it's alittle bit less negative.It goes like that.I don't know if I did that, drew that.Let me do it in a different color.Let me do it in purple.So over here, your slope is slightly less negative.It's a slightly less downward-sloping line.And then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here,your slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, yequals 0, is tangent to this curve.And then as you go to more positive x's, then yourslope starts increasing.I'm trying to draw a tangent line.And here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more.So your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kindof the big change that happens when you go from aline to a curve.A line, your slope is the same the entire time.You could take any two points of a line, take the change in yover the change in x, and you get the slope forthe entire line.But as you can see already, it's going to be a littlebit more nuanced when we do it for a curve.Because it depends what point we're talking about.We can't just say, what is the slope for this curve?The slope is different at every point along the curve.It changes.If we go up here, it's going to be even steeper.It's going to look something like that.So let's try a bit of an experiment.And I know how this experiment turns out, so it won'tbe too much of a risk.Let me draw better than that.So that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis.Let's call this, we can call this y, or we can callthis the f of x axis.Either way.And let me draw my curve again.And I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that.That's my curve.And what if I want to find the slope right there?What can I do?Well, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 pointsto find a slope, right?Here, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point.So let's just call this point right here,that's going to be x.We're going to be general.This is going to be our point x.But to find our slope, according to our traditionalalgebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points.So let's get another point in here.Let's just take a slightly larger version of this x.So let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it evenfurther out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise.So let's say we have this point right here.And the difference, it's just h bigger than x.Or actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, welllet me just say h bigger.So this is x plus h.That's what that point is right there.So what going to be their corresponding y-coordinateson the curve?Well, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x.So this point right here is going to be f of ourparticular x right here.And maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybeI'll do a little 0 here.This is x naught, this is x naught plus h.This is f of x naught.And then what is this going to be up here, this point uphere, that point up here?Its y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate,which I shifted over a little bit.It's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which isf of x naught plus h.That's its y-coordinate.So what is a slope going to be between these two points thatare relatively close to each other?Remember, this isn't going to be the slopejust at this point.This is the slope of the line between these two points.And if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be asecant line between, to the curve.So it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point,once at this point.You can't see it.If I blew it up a little bit, it would looksomething like this.This is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up hereis our coordinate for this point, which would be, thex-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinatewould be f of x naught plus h.Just whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at thisx-coordinate That's all it is.So these are the 2 points.So maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is theslope of this secant line?And just like we did in the previous example, you find thechange in y, and you divide that by your change in x.Let me draw it here.Your change in y would be that right here, change in y, andthen your change in x would be that right there.So what is the slope going to be of the secant line?The slope is going to be equal to, let's start with thispoint up here, just because it seems to be larger.So we want a change in y. so this value right here, thisy-value, is f of x naught plus h.I just evaluated this guy up here.Looks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look.The slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate.Where the curve is at that value of x.So that is going to be, so the change in y is going to bea f of x naught plus h.That's just the y-coordinate up here.Minus this y-coordinate over here.So minus f of x naught.So that equals our change in y.And you want to divide that by your change in x.So what is this?This is the larger x-value.We started with this coordinate, so we startwith its x-coordinate.So it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h.Minus this x-coordinate.Well, we just picked a general number.It's x naught.So that is over your change in x.Just like that.So this is the slope of the secant line.We still haven't answered what the slope is right at thatpoint, but maybe this will help us get there.If we simplify this, so let me write it down like this.The slope of the secant, let me write that properly.The slope of the secant line is equal to the value of thefunction at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the valueof the function here, mine f of x naught.So that just tells us the change in y.It's the exact same definition of slope we've always used.Over the change in x.And we can simplify this.We have x naught plus h minus x naught.So x naught minus x naught cancel out, so youhave that over h.So this is equal to our change in y over change in x.Fair enough.But I started off saying, I want to find the slope ofthe line at that point, at this point, right here.This is the zoomed-out version of it.So what can I do?Well, I defined second point here as just the firstpoint plus some h.And we have something in our toolkit called a limit.This h is just a general number.It could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1times 10 to the negative 100.It could be an arbitrarily small number.So what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically,if I were take the limit as h approaches 0?So, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number overhere, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd befinding the slope of this secant line.If I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding theslope of that secant line.If h is a little bit smaller, I'd be findingthe slope of that line.So as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer tofinding the slope of the line right at my point in question.Obviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is goingto be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there.But if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally smallnumber, then I'm going to get pretty close.So what happens if I take the limit as happroaches zero of this?So the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope.Of, let me switch to green.f of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change iny, over h, which is my change in x.And now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'llsee it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of anh, they'll write a delta x here.Where this second point would have been defined as x naughtplus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to justdelta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit asdelta x approaches 0.The exact same thing.h, delta x, doesn't matter.We're taking h as the difference between one x pointand then the higher x point, and then we're just going totake the limit as that approaches zero.We could have called that delta x just as easily.But I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slopeof the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of thetangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f.Let me write that down.And I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x.And this is going to be another function.Because remember, the slope changes at every x-value.No matter what x-value you pick, the slope isgoing to be different.Doesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve,it is different.It can be different.So now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply thisformula over here, and then I can tell you theslope at that point.And it all seems very confusing and maybeabstract at this point.In the next video, I'll actually do an example ofcalculating a slope, and it'll make it everything alittle bit more concrete.

tried to figure out the slope of apoint or the slope of a curve at a certain point.And the way we did, we said OK, well let's find the slopebetween that point and then another point that's not toofar away from that point.And we got the slope of the secantline.And it looks all fancy, but this is just the y value of thepoint that's not too far away, and this is just the y valuepoint of the point in question, so this isjust your change in y.And then you divide that by your change in x.So in the example we did, h was the differencebetween our 2 x values.This distance was h.And that gave us the slope of that line.We said hey, what if we take the limit as this pointright here gets closer and closer to this point.If this point essentially almost becomes this point, thenour slope is going to be the slope of our tangent line.And we define that as the derivative of our function.We said that's equal to f prime of x.So let's if we can apply this in this video to maybe makethings a little bit more concrete in your head.So let me do one.First I'll do a particular case where I want to find theslope at exactly some point.So let me draw my axes again.Let's draw some axes right there.Let's say I have the curve-- this is the curve-- yis equal to x squared.So this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and I want to knowthe slope at the point x is equal to 3.When I say the slope you can imagine a tangent line here.You can imagine a tangent line that goes just like that, andit would just barely graze the curve at that point.But what is the slope of that tangent line?What is the slope of that tangent line which is the sameas the slope of the curve right at that point.So to do it, I'm actually going to do this exact technique thatwe did before, then we'll generalize it so you don't haveto do it every time for a particular number.So let's take some other point here.Let's call this 3 plus delta x.I'm changing the notation because in some books you'llsee an h, some books you'll see a delta x, doesn't hurt tobe exposed to both of them.So this is 3 plus delta x.So first of all what is this point right here?This is a curve y is equal to x squared, so f of x is 3squared-- this is the point 9.This is the point 3,9 right here.And what is this point right here?So if we were go all the way up here, what is that point?Well here our x is 3 plus delta x.It's the same thing as this one right here,as x naughtplus h.I could have called this 3 plus h just as easily.So it's 3 plus delta x up there.So what's the y value going to be?Well whatever x value is, it's on the curve, it's goingto be that squared.So it's going to be the point 3 plus delta x squared.So let's figure out the slope of this secantline.And let me zoom in a little bit, because that might help.So if I zoom in on just this part of the curve,it might look like that.And then I have one point here, and then I have theother point is up here.That's the secantline.Just like that.This was the point over here, the point 3,9.And then this point up here is the point 3 plus delta x, sojust some larger number than 3, and then it's going tobe that number squared.So it's going to be 3 plus delta x squared.What is that?That's going to be 9.I'm just foiling this out, or you do the distributeproperty twice.a plus b squared is a squared plus 2 a b plus b squared, soit's going to be 9 plus two times the productof these things.So plus 6 delta x, and then plus delta x squared.That's the coordinate of the second line.This looks complicated, but I just took this x value and Isquared it, because it's on the line y is equal to x squared.So the slope of the secantline is going to be the change in y dividedby the change in x.So the change in y is just going to be this guy's y value,which is 9 plus 6 delta x plus delta x squared.That's this guy's y value, minus this guy's y value.So minus 9.That's your change in y.And you want to divide that by your change in x.Well what is your change in x?This is actually going to be pretty convenient.This larger x value-- we started with this point on thetop, so we have to start with this point on the bottom.So it's going to be 3 plus delta x.And then what's this x value?What is minus 3?That's his x value.So what does this simplify to?The numerator-- this 9 and that 9 cancel out,we get a 9 minus 9.And in the denominator what happens?This 3 and minus 3 cancel out.So the change in x actually end up becoming this delta x, whichmakes sense, because this delta x is essentially how much morethis guy is then that guy.So that should be the change in x, delta x.So the slope of my secantline has simplified to 6 times my change in x, plus my changein x squared, all of that over my change in x.And now we can simplify this even more.Let's divide the numerator and the denominatorby our change in x.And I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony.So my slope of my tangent of my secantline-- the one that goes through both of these-- isgoing to be equal if you divide the numerator anddenominator this becomes 6.I'm just dividing numerator and denominator by deltax plus six plus delta x.So that is the slope of this secantline So slope is equal to 6 plus delta x.That's this one right here.That's this reddish line that I've drawn right there.So this number right here, if the delta x was one, ifthese were the points 3 and 4, then my slope would be 6 plus1, because I'm picking a point 4 where the delta x herewould have to be 1.So the slope would be 7.So we have a general formula for no matter what my deltax is, I can find the slope between 3 and 3 plus delta x.Between those two points.Now we wanted to find the slope at exactly thatpoint right there.So let's see what happens when delta x getsmaller and smaller.This is what delta x is right now.It's this distance.But if delta x got a little bit smaller, then the secantline would look like that.Got even smaller, the secantline would look like that, it gets even smaller.Then we're getting pretty close to the slopeof the tangent line.The tangent line is this thing right here that Iwant to find the slope of.Let's find a limit as our delta x approaches 0.So the limit as delta x approaches 0 of ourslope of the secantline of 6 plus delta x is equal to what?This is pretty straightforward.You can just set this equal to 0 and it's equal to 6.So the slope of our tangent line at the point x is equal to3 right there is equal to 6.And another way we could write this if we wrote that f ofx is equal to x squared.We now know that the derivative or the slope of the tangentline of this function at the point 3-- I just only evaluatedit at the point 3 right there-- that that is equal to 6.I haven't yet come up with a general formula for the slopeof this line at any point, and I'm going to do thatin the next video.

found the slope at a particular point ofthe curve y is equal to x squared.But let's see if we can generalize this and come upwith a formula that finds us the slope at any point of thecurve y is equal to x squared.So let me redraw my function here.It never hurts to have a nice drawing.So that is my y-axis.That is my x-axis right there.My x-axis.Let me draw my curve.It looks something like that.You've seen that multiple times.This is y is equal to x squared.So let's be very general right now.Remember, if we want to find-- let me just write thedefinition of our derivative.So if we have some point right here-- let's call that x.So we want to be very general.We want to find the slope at the point x.We want to find a function where you give me an xand I'll tell you the slope at that point.We're going to call that f prime of x.That's going to be the derivative of f of x.But all it does is, look, f of x, you give-- it's a functionthat you give it an x, and it tells you the value of that.And we draw the curve here.With f of x, you give that same x but it's not going to tellyou the value of the curve.It's not going to say, oh, this is your f of x.It's going to give you the value of the slope ofthe curve at that point.So f of x, if you put it into that function, it should tellyou, oh, the slope at that point, is equal to-- you know,if you put 3 there, you'll say, oh, the slope thereis equal to 6.We saw that in the last example.So that's what we want to do.And we saw on the last-- I think it was 2-- videos ago,that we defined f prime of x to be equal to-- just the--well, I'll write it this way.It's the slope of the secant line between x and somepoint that's a little bit further away from x.So the slope of the secant line is change in y.So it's the y value of the point that's a littlebit further away from x.So f of x plus h minus the y value at x, right?Because this is right here.This is f of x.So minus f of x.All of that over the change in x.So if this is x plus h here, the change in xis x plus h minus x.Or this distance right here is just h.The change in x is going to be equal to h.So that's just slope of the secant line, betweenany 2 points like that.And we said, hey, we could find the slope of the tangent lineif we just take the limit of this as it approaches--as h approaches 0.And then we'll be finding the slope of the tangent line.Now let's apply this idea to a particular function, f ofx is equal to x squared.Or y is equal to x squared.So here, we could have the point-- we could consider thisto be the point x-- x squared.So f of x is just equal to x squared.And then this would be the point-- let me do it ina more vibrant color.This is the point x plus h-- that's this point right here.It's a little bit further down.And then x plus h squared.And you know, in the last video, we did thisfor a particular x.We did it for 3.But now I want a general formula.You give me any x and I won't have to do what I did in thelast video for any particular number.I'll have a general function.You give me 7, I'll tell you what the slope is at 7.You give me negative 3, I'll tell you what the slopeis at negative 3.You give me 100,000, I'll tell you what theslope is at 100,000.So let's apply it here.So we want to find the change in y over the change in x.So first of all, the change in y is this guy's y value,which is x plus h squared.That's this guy's y value right here.That's this right here.That's x plus h squared.I just took x plus h, evaluated, I squared it, andthat's its point on the curve.So it's x plus h squared.So that's there right there.And then what's this value?f of x right here is equal to-- I know it's getting messy--is equal to x squared.If you take your x, you evaluate the functionat that point, you're going to get x squared.So it's equal to minus x squared.This is your change in y.That's this distance right there.And just to relate it to our definition of a derivative,this blue thing right here is equivalent to thisthing right here.We just evaluated our function.Our function is f of x is equal to x squared.We just evaluated when x is equal to x plus h.So if you have to square it, if I put an a there,it'd be a squared.If I put an apple there, it'd be apple squared.If I put an x plus h in there, it's going tobe x plus h squared.So this is that thing.And then, this thing right here is just the function evaluatedat the point in question.Right there.So this is our change in y.And let's divide that by our change in x.Our change in x-- if this is x plus h and this is just x, ourchange in x is just going to be h.So that's where we get that term from.So this is just a slope between these 2 points.This is just a slope between those two points.But, of course, we want to find-- the limit at this pointgets closer and closer to this point, and this point getscloser and closer to that point.So this becomes a tangent line.So we're going to take the limit as h approaches 0, andthis is our f prime of x.And this is the exact same definition of this, insteadof being general and saying, for any function, we knowwhat the function was.It was f of x is equal to x squared.So we actually applied it.Instead of f of x, we wrote x squared.Instead of f of x plus h, we wrote x plus h squared.So let's see if we can evaluate this limit.So this is going to be equal to the limit as h approaches0 to square this out.I'll do it in the same color.That's x squared plus 2xh plus h squared, and then we havethis minus x squared over here.I just multiplied this guy out over here.And then all of that is divided by h.Now let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.Well, you immediately see you have an x squared and youhave a minus x squared, so those cancel out.And then we can divide the numerator and thedenominator by h.So this simplifies to-- so we get f prime of x is equal to--if we divide the numerator and the denominator by h--we get 2x plus h.I'm sorry, I forgot my limit.It equals the limit.Very important.Limit as h approaches 0 of divide everything by h, andyou get 2x plus h squared divided by h is h.And if you remember the last video, when we did it with aparticular x, we said x is equal to 3, we got 6plus delta x here.Or 6 plus h here, so it's very similar.So if you take the limited h approaches 0 here, that'sjust going to disappear.So this is just going to be equal to 2x.So we just figured out that if f of x-- this is a big result.This is exciting!That if f of x is equal to x squared, f primeof x is equal to 2x.That's what we just figured out.And I wanted to make sure you understandhow to interpret this.f of x, if you give me a value, is going to tell you the valueof the function at that point.At prime of x it's going to tell you theslope at that point.Let me draw that.Because this is a key realization.And you might, you know, it's kind of maybe initiallyunintuitive to think of a function that gives us theslope, at any point, of another function.So it looks like this.Let me draw a little neater than that.Ah, it's still not that neat.That's satisfactory.Let me just draw it in the positive coordinate.Well, I'll just draw the whole-- the curve lookssomething like that.Now this is the curve of f of x.This is the curve of f of x is equal to x squared.Just like that.So if you give me a point.You give me the point 7.You apply, you put it in here, you square it.And it is mapped to the number 49.So you get the number 49 right there.This is the number 7, 49.You're used to dealing with functions right there.But what is f prime of 7?f prime of 7.You say, 2 times 7 is equal to 14.What is this 14 number here?What is this thing?Well, this is the slope of the tangent lineat x is equal to 7.So if I were to take that point and draw a tangent line-- apoint that just grazes our curve-- if I were to justdraw a tangent line.That wasn't tangent enough for me.So that's my tangent line right there.You get the idea.The slope of this guy-- you do your change in y over yourchange in x-- is going to be equal to 14.The slope of the curve at y is equal to 7-- isa pretty steep curve.If you wanted to find the slope, let's say that thisis y-- let's say it's x is equal to 2.I said at x is equal to 7, the slope is 14.At x is equal to 2, what is the slope?Well, you figure out f prime of 2, which is equal to 2 times2, which is equal to 4.So the slope here is 4.You could say m is equal to 4. m for slope.What is f prime of 0?f prime.We know that f of 0 is 0, right?0 squared is 0.But what is f prime of 0?Well, 2 times 0 is 0.That's also equal to 0.But what does that mean?What's the interpretation?It means the slope of the tangent line is 0.So a 0 sloped line looks like this.Looks just like a horizontal line.And that looks about right.A horizontal line would be tangent to thecurve at y equals 0.Let's try another one.Let's try the point minus 1.So let's say we're right there. x is equal to minus 1.So f of minus 1, you just square it.Because we're dealing with x squared.So it's equal to 1.That's that point right there.What is f prime of minus 1?f prime of minus 1 is 2 times minus 1.2 times minus is minus 2.What does that mean?It means that the slope of the tangent line at x is equal to1, to this curve, to the function, is minus 2.So if I were to draw the tangent line here-- the tangentline looks like that-- and look, it is a downwardsloping line.And it makes sense.The slope here is equal to minus 2.

that this tablegives select values of the differentiable function F.So it gives us the value of the functionat a few values for X, in particular,five different values for X andit tells us what the corresponding f(x) is.And they say, what is the best estimatefor f'(4)?So this is the derivative of our function Fwhen X is equal to four.Or another way to think about it,what is the slope of the tangent linewhen X is equal to four for f(x)?So what is the best estimate for f'(4)we can make based on this table?So, let's just visualize what's going onbefore we even look at the choices.So let me draw some axes here.And let me plot these points.We know that these would sit on the curve of Yis equal to f(x).When X is zero, f(x) is 72.So this is the point (0,72).This is the point (3,95)clearly, two different scales on the X and Y axes.This is the point(5,112).This is (6,77).This is (9,54), actually, let mewrite outthethis is one, two, three,four, five, six,seven, eight, nine,and ten.Now they want us to know, they want towhat is the derivative of our functionwhen F is equal to four?Well, they haven't told useven what the value of F is at four.We don't know what that point is.But what they're trying to do is,well, we're trying to make a best estimate.And using these points, we don't even knowexactly what the curve looks like.It could look like all sorts of things.We could try to fit a reasonably smooth curve.The curve might look something like that.But it might be wackier.It might do something like this.Let me try to do it.It might look somethinglike this.So we don't know, for sure.All we know is thatit needs to go through those points.'Cause they've just sampled to the functionat those points.But let's just, for the sake ofthis exercise, let's assume the simplest,let's say it's a nice smoothcurve without too many twists and turnsthat goes through these points, just like that.So what they're asking, okay,when X is equal to fourif this yellow curve were the actual curvethen what is the slope of the tangent line, at that point?So we would be visualizing that.Now to be clear,this tangent line that I just drewthis would be forthis version of our function that I didconnecting these points.That does not have to bethe actual function.We know that the actual function has to gothrough those points.But I'm just doing this for visualization purposes.One of the whole ideas here isthat all we do have is the sampleand we're trying to get a best estimate.We don't knowif it's even gonna be a good estimate.It's just going to be a best estimate.So what we generally dowhen we just have some dataaround a point, is, let's use a data pointsthat are closestto that pointand find slopes of secant linespretty close around that point.And that's going to give us our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent line.So what points do we have nearF of four, or near the point(4,f(4))?Well, they give us what F is equal towhen X is equal to three.They give us this point, right over here.Let me do this in another color.So, (3,95)that is that right over there.And they also give us(5,112).That is that point right over there.And so what we could dowe could say, well, what is the averagerate of change between these two points?Another way to think about it is,what is the slope of the secant linebetween those two points.And, that would be our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent lineat X equals four.Do we know that it's a good estimate?Do we know that it's even close?No, we don't know for sure, but that wouldbe the best estimate.It would be better than trying to take thethe average rate of change betweenWhen X equals threeand X equals six.Or between when X equals zeroand X equals nine.These are pretty close around four.And so, let's do that.Let's find the average rate of changebetween when X goes from three to five.So, we can see hereour change in X.Let me do this in a new color.So our change in X hereis equal toplus two.And I can draw that out.My change in X hereisplus two.And, my change in Yis going to bewhen my X increased by two, my change in Y isplus, let's see, this isif I add ten I get toI get to 105.If I add another sevenso this is plus 17.So this is plus 17 right over here.Plus 17.And so my change in Y over change in X.Change in Yover my change in X.For this secant line betweenwhen X is equaling threeand X is equaling fiveis going to be equal to 17 over two.Seventeen overtwo.Which is equal to 8.5.So the slope of this green line here is 8.5.And that would be our best estimatefor the slope of the tangent line when X equals fourof the curve Y is equal to f(x).And so, lucky for usthe people who wrote this question hadthe exact same logic, and they did it right over there.So you wouldn't have to graph it the way I did.I did it just to help us visualize what's going on.In general, when you see a question like thisthey're really saying, look,you don't have all the data you needto figure out exactly what f'(4) is.But if you can find points close to, or aroundf'(4)and find the secant line, the average rateof the slope of the secant line.Or the average rate of change between those pointsthat's going to be our best estimatefor the instantaneous rate of changewhen X equals four.Or the derivative when X equals four.

videois explore the notion of differentiability at a point.And that is just a fancy way of sayingdoes the function have a defined derivative at a point?So let's just remind ourselves a definition of a derivative.And there's multiple ways of writing this.For the sake of this video, I'll write it asthe derivative of our function at point C,this is Lagrange notation with this F prime.The derivative of our function F at C is going to be equalto the limit as X approaches Zof F of X, minus F of C,over X minus C.And at first when you see this formula,and we've seen it before, it looks a little bit strange,but all it is is it's calculating the slope,this is our change in the value of our function,or you could think of it as our change in Y,if Y is equal to F of X, and this is our change in X.And we're just trying to see, well, what is that slopeas X gets closer and closer to C, as our change in Xgets closer and closer to zero?And we talk about that in other videos.So I'm now going to make a few claims in this video,and I'm not going to prove them rigorously.There's another video that will go a little bit moreinto the proof direction.But this is more to get an intuition.And so the first claim that I'm going to makeis if F is differentiable,at X equals C,at X equals C,then F is continuousat X equals C.So I'm saying if we know it's differentiable,if we can find this limit,if we can find this derivative at X equals C,then our function is also continuous at X equals C.It doesn't necessarily mean the other way around,and actually we'll look at a case where it's notnecessarily the case the other way around thatif you're continuous, then you're definitely differentiable.But another way to interpret what I just wrote down is,if you are not continuous, then you definitelywill not be differentiable.If F not continuousat X equals C, then Fis not differentiable,differentiable at X is equal to C.So let me give a few examples of a non-continuous functionand then think about would we be able to find this limit.So the first is where you have a discontinuity.Our function is defined at C, it's equal to this value,but you can see as X becomes larger than C,it just jumps down and shifts right over here.So what would happen if you were trying to find this limit?Well, remember, all this is is a slope of a linebetween when X is some arbitrary value,let's say it's out here, so that would be X,this would be the point X comma F of X,and then this is the point C comma F of C right over here.So this is C comma F of C.So if you find the left side of the limit right over here,you're essentially saying okay, let's find this slope.And then let me get a little bit closer,and let's get X a little bit closerand then let's find this slope.And then let's get X even closer than thatand find this slope.And in all of those cases, it would be zero.The slope is zero.So one way to think about it, the derivative or this limitas we approach from the left, seems to be approaching zero.But what about if we were to take Xs to the right?So instead of our Xs being there,what if we were to take Xs right over here?Well, for this point, X comma F of X,our slope, if we take F of X minus F of Cover X minus C, that would be the slope of this line.If we get X to be even closer, let's say right over here,then this would be the slope of this line.If we get even closer, then this expressionwould be the slope of this line.And so as we get closer and closer to X being equal to C,we see that our slope is actuallyapproaching negative infinity.And most importantly, it's approachinga very different value from the right.This expression is approaching a very different valuefrom the right as it is from the left.And so in this case, this limit up here won't exist.So we can clearly say this is not differentiable.So once again, not a proof here.I'm just getting an intuition for if somethingisn't continuous, it's pretty clear, at least in this case,that it's not going to be differentiable.Let's look at another case.Let's look at a case where we have what's sometimes calleda removable discontinuity or a point discontinuity.So once again, let's say we're approaching from the left.This is X, this is the point X comma F of X.Now what's interesting is where as this expressionis the slope of the line connecting X comma F of Xand C comma F of C, which is this point, not that point,remember we have this removablediscontinuity right over here,and so this would be this expression is calculatingthe slope of that line.And then if X gets even closer to C, well, then we're gonnabe calculating the slope of that line.If X gets even closer to C, we're gonna be calculatingthe slope of that line.And so as we approach from the left, as X approaches Cfrom the left, we actually have a situationwhere this expression right over here is goingto approach negative infinity.And if we approach from the right, if we approachwith Xs larger than C, well, this is our X comma F of X,so we have a positive slope and then as we get closer,it gets more positive, more positiveapproaches positive infinity.But either way, it's not approaching a finite value.And one side is approaching positive infinity,and the other side is approaching negative infinity.This, the limit of this expression, is not going to exist.So once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof here,but try to construct a discontinuous functionwhere you will be able to find this.It is very, very hard.And you might say, well, what about the situationswhere F is not even defined at C, which for sureyou're not gonna be continuous if F is not defined at C.Well if F is not defined at C, then this partof the expression wouldn't even make sense,so you definitely wouldn't be differentiable.But now let's ask another thing.I've just given you good arguments for when you'renot continuous, you're not going to be differentiable,but can we make another claim that if you are continuous,then you definitely will be differentiable?Well, it turns out that there are for suremany functions, an infinite number of functions,that can be continuous at C, but not differentiable.So for example, this could be an absolute value function.It doesn't have to be an absolute value function,but this could be Y is equal tothe absolute value of X minus C.And why is this one not differentiable at C?Well, think about what's happening.Think about this expression.Remember, this expression all it's doing is calculatingthe slope between the point X comma F of Xand the point C comma F of C.So if X is, say, out here, this is X comma F of X,it's going to be calculated, so if we take the limitas X approaches C from the left,we'll be looking at this slope.And as we get closer, we'll be looking at this slopewhich is actually going to be the same.In this case it would be a negative one.So as X approaches C from the left,this expression would be negative one.But as X approaches C from the right,this expression is going to be one.The slope of the line that connects these points is one.The slope of the line that connects these points is one.So the limit of this expression, or I would say the valueof this expression, is approaching two different valuesas X approaches C from the left or the right.From the left, it's approaching negative one,or it's constantly negative one and so it's approachingnegative one, you could say.And from the right, it's one,and it's approaching one the entire time.And so we know if you're approaching two different valuesfrom on the left side or the right side of the limit,then this limit will not exist.So here, this is not, not differentiable.And even intuitively, we think of the derivativeas the slope of the tangent line.And you could actually draw an infinite numberof tangent lines here.That's one way to think about it.You could say, well, maybe this is the tangent lineright over there, but then why can't I makesomething like this the tangent line?That only intersects at the point C comma zero.And then you could keep doing things like that.Why can't that be the tangent line?And you could go on and on and on.So the big takeaways here, at least intuitively,in a future video I'm going to prove to youthat if F is differentiable at C that it is continuous at C,which can also be interpreted as that if you're notcontinuous at C, then you're not gonna be differentiable.These two examples will hopefully give yousome intuition for that.But it's not the case that if something is continuousthat it has to be differentiable.It oftentimes will be differentiable, but it doesn't haveto be differentiable, and this absolute value functionis an example of a continuous function at C,but it is not differentiable at C.

function f is given below.It has a vertical tangent at the point three comma zero.Three comma zero has a vertical tangent, let me draw that.It has a vertical tangent right over there,and a horizontal tangent at the pointzero comma negative three.Zero comma negative three,so it has a horizontal tangent right over there,and also has a horizontal tangent at six comma three.Six comma three, let me drawthe horizontal tangent, just like that.Select all the x-values for which f is not differentiable.Select all that apply.F prime, f prime, I'll write it in short hand.We say no f prime underit's going to happen under three conditions.The first condition you could saywell we have a vertical tangent.Vertical tangent.Why is a vertical tangent a place whereit's hard to define our derivative?Well, remember, our derivative iswe're really trying to find our rate of change of ywith respect to x,but when you have a vertical tangent,you change your x a very small amount,you have an infinite change in y,either in the positive or the negative direction.That's one situation where you have no derivative.They tell us where we have a vertical tangent in here,where x is equal to three.We have no ...F is not differentiable at x equals threebecause of the vertical tangent.You might say what about horizontal tangents?No, horizontal tangents are completely fine.Horizontal tangents are places where the derivativeis equal to zero.F prime of six is equal to zero.F prime of zero is equal to zero.What are other scenarios?Well another scenario where you're not gonna havea defined derivative is where the graph is not continuous.Not continuous.We see right over here at x equals negative three,our graph is not continuous.X equals negative three it's not continuous.Those are thee only places where f is not differentiablethat they're giving us options on.We don't know what the graph is doingto the left or the right.These there I guess would be interesting cases.They haven't given us those choices here.We already said, at x equals 0, the derivative is zero.It's defined.It's differentiable there.At x equals six, the derivative is zero.We have a flat tangent.Once again it's defined there as well.Let's do another one of these.Actually, I didn't include, I think thatthis takes care of this problem,but there's a third scenarioin which we have, I'll call it a sharp turn.A sharp turn.This isn't the most mathy definition right over here,but it's easy to recognize.A sharp turn is something like that,or like, well no, that doesn't look too sharp,or like this.The reason why where you have these sharp bendsor sharp turns as opposed to somethingthat looks more smooth like that.The reason why we're not differentiable there isas we approach this point,as we approach this point from either side,we have different slopes.Notice our slope is positive right over here,as x increases, y is increasing,While the slope is negative here.As you're trying to find the limit of our slopeas we approach this point,it's not going to exist because it's differenton the left hand side and the right hand side.That's why the sharp turns, I don't see any sharp turns hereso it doesn't apply to this example.Let's do one more examples.Actually this one does have some sharp turns.This could be interesting.The graph of function f is given to the left right here.It has a vertical asymptote at x equals negative three,we see that,and horizontal asymptotes at y equals zero.This end of the curve as x approaches negative infinityit looks like y is approaching zero.It has another horizontal asymptote at y equals four.As x approaches infinity, it looks likeour graph is trending down to y is equal to four.Select the x values for which f is not differentiable.First of all, we could think about vertical tangents.Doesn't seem to have any vertical tangents.Then we could think about where we are not continuous.Well, we're definitely not continuouswhere we have this vertical asymptote right over here.We're not continuous at x equals negative three.We're also not continuous at x is equal to one.Then the last situation wherewe are not going to be differentiableis where we have a sharp turn,or you could kind of view it as a sharp point, on our graph.I see a sharp point right over there.Notice as we approach from the left hand side,the slope looks like a constant, I don't know,it's like a positive three halves,while as we go to the right side of thatit looks like our slope turns negative.If you were to try to find the limit of the slopeas we approach from either side,which is essentially what you're trying to dowhen you try to find the derivative,well it's not going to be definedbecause it's different from either side.F is also not differentiable at the x valuethat gives us that little sharp point right over there.If you were to graph the derivative,which we will do in future videos,you will see that the derivative is notcontinuous at that point.Let me mark that off.Then we can check x equals zero.X equals zero's completely cool.We're at a point that our tangent lineis definitely not vertical.We're definitely continuous there.We definitely do not have a sharp point or edge.We're completely cool at x equals zero.

[Voiceover] Is the function given below continuousslash differentiable at x equals one?And they define the function g piece wiseright over here, and then theygive us a bunch of choices.Continuous but not differentiable.Differentiable but not continuous.Both continuous and differentiable.Neither continuous nor differentiable.And, like always, pause this videoand see if you could figure this out.So let's do step by step.So first let's think about continuity.So for continuity, for g to be continuous at x equals onethat means that g of one, that means g of onemust be equal to the limit as x approaches oneof g of g of x.Well g of one, what is that going to be?G of one we're going to fall into this case.One minus one squared is going to be zero.So if we can show that the limit of g of xas x approaches one is the same as g of oneis equal to zero than we know we're continuous there.Well let's do the left and right handed limits here.So if we do the left handed limit, limit,and that's especially useful 'cause we're inthese different clauses here as we approachfrom the left and the right hand side.So as x approaches one fromthe left hand side of g of x.Well we're going to be falling into this situation hereas we approach from the left as x is less than one.So this is going to be the same thing as that.That's what g of x is equal to when weare less than one as we're approaching from the left.Well this thing is defined, and it's continuousfor all real numbers.So we could just substitute one in for x,and we get this is equal to zero.So so far so good, let's do one more of these.Let's approach from the right hand side.As x approaches one from the right hand side of g of x.Well now we're falling into this caseso g of x if we're to the right of oneif values are greater or equal to oneit's gonna be x minus one squared.Well once again x minus one squaredthat is defined for all real numbers.It's continuous for all real numbers,so we could just pop that one in there.You get one minus one squared.Well that's just zero again,so the left hand limit, the right hand limitare both equal zero, which means that thelimit of g of x as x approaches one is equal to zero.Which is the same thing as g of one,so we are good with continuity.So we can rule out all of the onesthat are saying that it's not continuous.So we can rule out that one,and we can rule out that one right over there.So now let's think about whether it is differentiable.So differentiability.So differentiability, I'll write differentiability, ability.Did I, let's see, that's a long word.Differentiability, alright.Differentiability, what needs to be true here?Well we have to have a defined limitas x approaches one for f of xminus f of one over,oh let me be careful, it's not f it's g.So we need to have a defined limit for g of xminus g of oneover x minus one.And so let's just try to evaluate this limitfrom the left and right hand sides,and we can simplify it.We already know that g of one is zero.So that's just going to be zero.So we just need to find the limitas x approaches one of g of x over x minus oneor see if we can find the limit.So let's first think about the limitas we approach from the left hand sideof g of x overx minus.G of x over x minus one.Well as we approach from the left hand side,g of x is that right over there.So we could write this.Instead of writing g of x,we could write this as x minus one.X minus one over x minus one,and as long as we aren't equal to one,this thing is going to be equalas long as x does not equal one.X minus one over x minus one is just going to be one.So this limit is going to be one.So that one worked out.Now let's think about the limitas x approaches one from the right hand sideof, once again, I could write g of x of g of one,but g of one is just zero,so I'll just write g of x over x minus one.Well what's g of x now?Well it's x minus one squared.So instead of writing g of x,I could write this as x minus one squaredover x minus one,and so as long as x does not equal one,we're just doing the limit.We're saying as we approach one from the right hand side.Well, this expression right over hereyou have x minus one squared divided by x minus one,well, that's just going to give us x minus one.X minus one squared divided by x minus oneis just going to be x minus one,and this limit, well this expression right over hereis going to be continuous and defined for sure allx's that are not equaling one.Actually, let me, let me, well,it was before it was this,x minus one squared over x minus one.This thing over here, as I said, is not definedfor x equals one, but it is defined for anythingfor x does not equal one, and we're just approaching one.And, if we wanted to simplify this expression,it would get, this would just beI think I just did this,but I'm making sure I'm doing it right.This is going to be the same this as thatfor x not being equal to one.Well this is just going to be zero.We could just evaluate when x is equal to one here.This is going to be equal to zero.And so notice, you get a different limitfor this definition of the derivative as we approachfrom the left hand side or the right hand side,and that makes sense.This graph is gonna look something like,we have a slope of one, so it's gonna looksomething like this.And then right when x is equal to oneand the value of our function is zeroit looks something like this, it looks something like this.And so the graph is continuousthe graph for sure is continuous,but our slope coming into that point is one,and our slope right when we leave that point is zero.So it is not differentiable over there.So it is continuous, continuous, but not differentiable.

Let's sayI have some constant times some function.Well, derivatives work out quite well.You can actually take this little scalar multiplier,this little constant, and take it out of the derivative.This is going to be equal to A. I didn'twant to do that magenta color.It's going to be equal to A times the derivative of f of x.Let me do that blue color.And the other way to denote the derivative of f of xis to just say that this is the same thing.This is equal to A times this thing right over hereis the exact same thing as f prime of x.Now this might all look like really fancy notation,but I think if I gave you an exampleit might make some sense.So what about if I were to ask you the derivative with respectto x of 2 times x to the fifth power?Well, this property that I just articulatedsays, well, this is going to be the same thing as 2times the derivative of x to the fifth, 2 times the derivativewith respect to x of x to the fifth.Essentially, I could just take this scalar multiplierand put it in front of the derivative.So this right here, this is the derivativewith respect to x of x to the fifth.And we know how to do that using the power rule.This is going to be equal to 2 times-- let me write that.I want to keep it consistent with the colors.This is going to be 2 times the derivative of x to the fifth.Well, the power rule tells us, n is 5.It's going to be 5x to the 5 minus 1 or 5xto the fourth power.So it's going to be 5x to the fourth power, whichis going to be equal to 2 times 5 is 10, x to the fourth.So 2x to the fifth, you can literally justsay, OK, the power rule tells me derivativeof that is 5x to the fourth.5 times 2 is 10.So that simplifies our life a good bit.We can now, using the power rule and this one property,take the derivative anything thattakes the form Ax to the n power.Now let's think about another very usefulderivative property.And these don't just apply to the power rule,they apply to any derivative.But they are especially useful for the power rulebecause it allows us to construct polynomials and takethe derivatives of them.But if I were to take the derivativeof the sum of two functions-- so the derivative of,let's say one function is f of x and thenthe other function is g of x.It's lucky for us that this ends upbeing the same thing as the derivative of fof x plus the derivative of g of x.So this is the same thing as f-- actually,let me use that derivative operator just to make it clear.It's the same thing as the derivative with respectto x of f of x plus the derivative with respectto x of g of x.So we'll put f of x right over hereand put g of x right over there.And so with the other notation, wecan say this is going to be the same thing.Derivative with respect to x of f of x, we can write as fprime of x.And the derivative with respect to x of g of x,we can write as g prime of x.Now, once again, this might look like kind of fancy notationto you.But when you see an example, it'll make it pretty clear.If I want to take the derivative with respectto x of let's say x to the third powerplus x to the negative 4 power, this justtells us that the derivative of the sumis just the sum of the derivatives.So we can take the derivative of this term using the power rule.So it's going to be 3x squared.And to that, we can add the derivative of this thing rightover here.So it's going to be plus-- that'sa different shade of blue-- and over here is negative 4.So it's plus negative 4 times x to the negative 4 minus 1,or x to the negative 5 power.So we have-- and I could just simplify a little bit.This is going to be equal to 3x squaredminus 4x to the negative 5.And so now we have all the tools we need in our toolkitto essentially take the derivative of any polynomial.So let's give ourselves a little practice there.So let's say that I have-- and I'll do it in white.Let's say that f of x is equal to 2xto the third power minus 7x squared plus 3x minus 100.What is f prime of x?What is the derivative of f with respect to x going to be?Well, we can use the properties that we just said.The derivative of this is just goingto be 2 times the derivative of x to the third.Derivative of x to the third is going to be 3x squared,so it's just going to be 2 times 3x squared.What's the derivative of negative 7xsquared going to be?Well, it's just going to be negative 7 timesthe derivative of x squared, which is 2x.What is the derivative of 3x going to be?Well, it's just going to be 3 times the derivative of x,or 3 times the derivative of x to the first.The derivative of x to the first is just 1.So this is just going to be plus 3 times--we could say 1x to the 0-- but that's just 1.And then finally, what's the derivative of a constantgoing to be?Let me do that in a different color.What's the derivative of a constant going to be?Well, we covered that at the beginning of this video.The derivative of any constant is justgoing to be 0, so plus 0.And so now we are ready to simplify.The derivative of f is going to be2 times 3x squared is just 6x squared.Negative 7 times 2x is negative 14x plus 3.And we don't have to write the 0 there.And we're done.We now have all the properties in our tool beltto find the derivative of any polynomialand actually things that even go beyond polynomials.

We've been givensome interesting information hereabout the functions f, g, and h.For f, they tell us for given values of xwhat f of x is equal toand what f prime of x is equal to.Then they defined g of x for usin terms of this kind of absolute value expression.Then they define h of x for us,in terms of both f of x and g of x.What we're curious about is what is the derivativewith respect to x, of h of x at x is equal to nine.I encourage you to pause this videoand think about it on your ownbefore I work through it.Let's think about it a little bit.Another way just to get familiar with the notationof writing this, the derivative of h of xwith respect to x at x equals nine.This is equivalent to h, we need that blue color,it is equivalent to h primeand the prime signifies that we're taking the derivative.H prime of x, when x equals nineso h prime of nine is what this really is.Actually I'm going to do this in a different color.This is h prime of nine.Let's think about what that is.Let's take the derivative of both sidesof this expressionto figure out what the derivative with respect to x of h is.We get a derivative, I'll do that same white color.A derivative with respect to x of h of xis going to be equal to the derivative with respect to xof all of this business.I could actually just, well I'll just rewrite it.Three times f of x, plus two times g of x.Now this right over here,the derivative of the sum of two termsthat's going to be the same thingas the sum of the derivatives of each of the terms.This is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to xof three times, I'll write that a little bit neater.Three times f of x, plus the derivative with respect to xof two times g of x.Now the derivative of a numberor I guess you could say a scaling factor times a function.The derivative of a scalar times the functionis the same thing as a scalar timesthe derivative of the function.What does that mean?Well that just means that this first term right over herethat's going to be equivalent tothree times the derivative with respect to xof f, of our f of x,plus this part over here is the same thing as two.Okay, make sure I don't run out of space here,plus two times the derivative with respect to x.The derivative with respect to x of g of x.Derivative of h with respect to xis equal to three times the derivativeof f with respect to x,plus two times the derivative of g with respect to x.If we want to write it in this kind of prime notation here,we could rewrite it as h prime of x is equal tothree times f prime of x,so this part right over herethat is the same thing as f prime of x.It's three times f prime of x, plus two times g prime of x.Once you are more fluent with this property,the derivative of the sum of two thingsis the sum of the derivatives.The derivative of a scalar times somethingis the same thing as a scalar times the derivativeof that something.You really could have gone straight from hereto here, pretty quickly.Now why is this interesting,well now we can evaluate this functionwhen x is equal to nine.H prime of nine is the same thingas three times f prime of nine,plus two times g prime of nine.Now what is f prime of nine?The derivative of our function fwhen x is equal to nine.Well they tell us, when x is equal to nine,f of nine is onebut more importantly f prime of nine is three.This part right over here evaluates that part's three.What's g prime of nine?Let's look at this function a little bit more closely.There's a couple of ways we could think about it.Actually let's try to graph it,now I think that could be interesting.Just to visualize what's going on here.Let's say that's our y-axisand do this right over here is our x-axis.Now when does an absolute value function like this,when is this going to hit a minimum point?Well the absolute value of somethingis always going to be non-negative.It hits a minimum point when this thing is equal to zero.Well when is this thing equal to zero?When x equals one, this thing is equal to zero.We hit a minimum point when x is equal to one,and when x equals one, this term is zeroabsolute value of zero, zero.G of one is one.We have this point right over there.Now what happens after that?What happens for x greater than one?Actually let me write this down.G of x is equal to,and in general whenever you have an absolute value,a relatively simple absolute value function like thisyou could think of it, you could break it upinto two functionor you could think about this functionover different intervalswhen the absolute value is non-negativeand when the absolute value is negative.When the absolute value is non-negativethat's when x is greater than or equal to zero.When the absolute value is non-negative,if you're taking the absolute value of a non-negative numberthat is just going to be itself.The absolute value of zero, zero.Absolute value of one is one.The absolute value of a hundred is a hundred.Then you could ignore the absolute valuefor x is greater than or equal to,not greater than or equal to zero,for x is greater than or equal to one.X is greater than or equal to one,this thing right over here is non-negative.It will just evaluate to x minus one.This is going to be x minus one plus one.Which is the same thing as just x,minus one plus one, they just cancel out.Now when this term right over here is negativeand that's going to happen for x is less than one.Well then the absolute valueis going to be the opposite of it.You give me the absolute value of a negative numberthat's going to be the opposite.Absolute value of negative eight is positive eight.It's going to be that the negative of x minus oneis one minus x, plus one.Or we could say two minus x.For x is greater or equal to one,we would look at this expression,now what's the slope of that?Well the slope of that is one.We're going to have a curve that looks likeor a line I guess we could say that looks like this.For all x is greater than or equal to one.The important thing, remember,we're going to think about the slope of the tangent linewhen we think about the derivative of g.Slope is equal to one.For x less than one or our slope now,if we look right over hereour slope is negative one.It's going to look like this.It's going to look like that.For the pointing question,if we're thinking about g prime of nineso nine is some place out here,so what is g prime of nine?G prime of nine, let me make it clear,this graph right over here,this is the graph of g of xor we could say y, this is the graph y equals g of x.Y is equal to g of x.What is g prime of nine?Well that's the slope when x is equal to nine.The slope is going to be equal to one.G prime of nine is one.What does this evaluate to?This is going to be three times three,so this part right over here is nineplus two times one, plus two, which is equal to 11.The slope of the tangent line of hwhen x is equal to nine is 11.

[Voiceover] So I have the function F of X hereand we're defining it using a polynomial expression.And what I would like to do here istake the derivative of our functionwhich is essentially gonna make us takethe derivative of this polynomial expressionand we're gonna take the derivativewith respect to X.So the first thing I'm gonna do islet's take the derivative of both sides.So we can say the derivative with respect to Xof F of Xof F of Xis equal to the derivativewith respect to Xthe derivative with respect to Xof X to the fifthX to the fifthplus twoplus two X to the thirdminus X squared.And so the notation, just to get familiar with ityou could do this as the derivative operator.This is, I want to take the derivativeof whatever's inside of the parentheseswith respect to X.So the derivative of F with respect to Xwe could use the notationbut that is just F prime ofF prime of X.And that is going to be equal to.Now here we can use our derivative properties.The derivative of the sum or differenceof a bunch of things.The derivative of is equal to the sumof the difference of the derivative of each of them.So this is equal to the derivativelet me just, with the derivative with respect to Xof each of these three things.So the derivative with respect to X.Let me just write it out like this.Of that first termplus the derivative with respect to Xof that second termminus the derivative with respect to Xof that third term.Of that third term.And I'll color code it here.So here I had an X of the fifthso I'll put the X to fifthX of the fifth there.Here I had a two X to the third.So I'll put the two X to the third there.And here I have a X squaredI'm subtracting an X squaredso I'm subtracting the derivative with respect to Xof X squared.So notice all that's happening here isI'm taking the derivative individually ofeach of these terms and then I'm addingor subtracting in the same way that the termswere added or subtracted.And so what is this going to be equal to?Well, this is going to be equal tofor X of the fifthwe can just use the power rule.We can bring the five out frontand decrement the exponent by oneso it becomes five Xwe can say to the five minus one power.Which of course, is just four.And then for this second onewe could do it in a few steps.Actually, let me just write it out here.So I could writeI could write the derivativewith respect to Xof two X to the third poweris the same thingit's equal tothe same, we could bring the constant out.The derivative with, two times the derivativewith respect to Xof X to the third power.This is one of ourthis is one of our derivative properties.The derivative of a constanttimes some expressionis the same thing as a constanttimes the derivative of that expression.And what will the derivative with respect to Xto the third be?Well, we would bring the three out frontand decrement the exponent.And so this would be equal tothis twotimes the threetimes X to the three minus one power.Which is, of course, the second power.So this would give us six X squared.So, another way that you could have done itI could just writeI could just write a six X squared here.So I could just, so this is going to besix X squared.And, instead of going through all of thisyou'll learn as you do more of these,that you could have done this pretty muchin your head.Say look, I have the three out here as an exponent.Let me multiply the three times this coefficientbecause that's what we ended up doing anyway.Three times the coefficient is six Xand then three minus one is two.So you didn't necessarily have to do thisbut it's nice to see that this comes out ofthe derivative properties that we talk aboutin other videos.And then finally,we have minus.And we use thepower rule right over here.So, bring the two out frontand decrement the exponent.So it's gonna be two.It's going to betwo times Xto the two minus one powerwhich is just one.Which, we could just write as two X.So just like that we have been ableto figure out the derivative of F.And you might say, well what this thing now?Well now we have an expression that tells usthe slope of the tangent line.Or you could view it as the instantaneousrate of change with respect to Xfor any X value.So, if I were to sayif I were to now to sayF prime, let's say F prime of two.This would tell me what isthe slope of the tangent line of our functionwhen X is equal to two.And I do that by using this expression.So this is gonna befive times two to the fourthplus plussix times two squared.Six times two squared.Minus minustwo times two.Minus two times two.And this is going to be equal tolet's see, two to the fourth power is 16,16 times five is 80.And that's 80, and thenthis is six times four,which is 24.And then we are going to subtract four.So this is 80 plus 24 is 104minus four is equal to 100.So, when X is equal to twothis curve is really steep.The slope is 100.If you look, if you were to graphthe tangent line when X is equal to twofor every positive movement in the X-directionby one you're gonna move up in the Y-directionby 100.So it's really steep there and it makes sense.This is a pretty high degree.X to the fifth power and then we're adding thatto another high degreeX to the third power.And then we're subtracting a lower degree.So that's what you would expect.

the x over 2plus x to the third power.And what we want to do is find the equationof the tangent line to this curve at the point x equals 1.And when x is equal to 1, y is going to be equal to e over 3.It's going to be e over 3.So let's try to figure out the equation of the tangent lineto this curve at this point.And I encourage you to pause this videoand try this on your own first.Well, the slope of the tangent line at this pointis the same thing as the derivative at this point.So let's try to find the derivative of thisor evaluate the derivative of this function right over hereat this point.So to do that, first I'm going to rewrite it.You could use the quotient rule if you like,but I always forget the quotient rule.The product rule is much easier for me to remember.So I can rewrite this as y is equal to-- and I mightas well color code it-- is equal to e to the x times 2 plus xto the third to the negative 1 power.And so the derivative of this, so let me write it here.So y prime is going to be equal to the derivativeof this part of it, e to the x.So the derivative of e to the x is just e to the x.Just let me write that.So we're going to take the derivative of it.And that's what's amazing about e to the x,is that the derivative of e to the xis just e to the x times this thing.So times 2 plus x to the third to the negative 1.And then to that we're going to add this thing.So not its derivative anymore.We're just going to add e to the xtimes the derivative of this thing right over here.So we're going to take the derivative.So we can do the chain rule.It's going to be the derivative of 2plus x to the third to the negative 1power with respect to 2 plus x to the third timesthe derivative of 2 plus x to the third with respect to x.So this is going to be equal to negative-- I'llwrite it this way-- negative 2 plus x to the thirdto the negative 2 power.And then we're going to multiply that times the derivative of 2plus x to the third with respect to x.Well, derivative of this with respect to xis just 3x squared.And of course, we could simplify this a little bit if we like.But the whole point of this is to actually findthe value of the derivative at this point.So let's evaluate.Let's evaluate y prime when x is equal to 1.Y prime of 1 when x is equal to 1.This thing will simplify to-- let's see,this is going to be e times 2 plus 1 to the negative power.So that's just going to be 1/3, right?2 plus 1 to the negative 1.So that's 3 to the negative 1.That's 1/3.So that's times 1/3 plus e to the first power.Now let's see, what does this do?This part right over here, this is2 plus 1 to the negative 2 power.So this-- actually, let me-- I don'twant to-- so this part right over here is going to be,let's see, this is going to be-- Idon't want to make a careless mistake here--is 3 to the negative 2 power.So 3 squared is 9.3 to the negative second power is 1/9.And so it's going to be 1/9.Well, you're going to multiply this negative there.So it's negative 1/9.And then we're going to multiply that times 3 times 1.So it's negative 1/9 times 3.Times 3 right over here.So it's negative 3/9 or negative 1/3.So times negative 1/3.And all I did here is I substituted 1for x and evaluated it.Now this is interesting.I have essentially-- let me rewrite this.This is equal to e over 3 minus e over 3, which is equal to 0.So the slope of the derivative when x is equal to 1 is 0,or the slope of the tangent line is equal to 0.This simplified to a pretty straightforward situation.If I wanted to write a line in slope intercept form,I could write it like this. y is equal to mx plus b, wherem is the slope and b is the y-intercept.Now we know that the slope of the tangent line at this point,it has a slope, is 0.So this is going to be 0.So this whole term is going to be 0.So it's just going to have the form y is equal to b.This is just going to be a horizontal line.So what is a horizontal line thatcontains this point right over here?Well, it contains the value y is equal to e over 3.So this is a horizontal line.It has the same y value the entire time.So if it has the y value e over 3,then we know the equation of the tangent lineto this curve at this point is goingto be y is equal to e over 3.Another way you could think about this right over hereis, well, let's substitute when x is equal to 1.Well, there's not even an x here.But when x is any value, y is equal to e over 3,you get b is equal to e over 3, or you'dget y is equal to e over 3.So it's just a horizontal line.So let's actually visualize this, justto make sure that this actually makes sense.So let me get my graphing calculator out.And so I'm in graphing mode.If you wanted to know how to get there,you literally can just go to graph, y equals,and I will do-- so e to the x power dividedby 2 plus x to the third power.That looks right.And I actually set the range ahead of time to save time.So let me graph this.So let's see.Ooh, it does all sorts of interesting things.All right.Oh, look at that.All right, so now we can trace to get to when x is equal to 1.x equals 1.Right over there, you see y is equal to e over 3,which this is kind of its decimal expansionright over here.And it does look like the slope right over hereis 0, that the tangent line is justgoing to be a horizontal line at that point.So that makes me feel pretty good about our answer.

this videois prove that if a function is differentiableat some point, C, that it's alsogoing to be continuous at that point C.But, before we do the proof, let's just remind ourselveswhat differentiability means and what continuity means.So, first, differentiability.DifferentiabilitySo, let's think about that, first.And it's always helpful to draw ourselvesa function.So, that's our Y-axis.This is our X-axis.And let's just draw some function, here.So, let's say my function looks like thisand we care about the point X equals C,which is right over here.So, that's the point X equals C,and then, this value, of course,is going to be F of C.F of C.And one way that we can find the derivativeat X equals C, or the slope of the tangent lineat X equals C is, we could start with some other point.Say, some arbitrary X out here.So, let's say this is some arbitrary X out here.So, then, this point right over there, this value,this Y value, would be F of X.Would be F of X.This graph, of course, is a graph of Y equals F of X.And we can think about finding the slope of this line,this secant line between these two points,but then, we can find the limit as X approaches C.And as X approaches C, this secant,the slope of the secant line is going to approachthe slope of the tangent line, or,it's going to be the derivative.And so, we could take the limit...The limit as X approaches C,as X approaches C,of the slope of this secant line.So, what's the slope?Well, it's gonna be change in Y over change in X.The change in Y is F of X minus F of C,that's our change in Y right over here.This is all review, this is just one definitionof the derivative, or one way to think about the derivative.So, it's going to be F of X minus F of C,that's our change in Y, over our change in X.Over our change in X, which is X minus C.It is X minus,X minus C.So, if this limit exists, then, we're able to findthe slope of the tangent line at this point,and we call that slope of the tangent line,we call that the derivative at X equals C.We say that this is going to be equal to F prime,F prime of C.All of this is review.So, if we're saying, one way to think about it,if we're saying that the function, F,is differentiable at X equals C,we're really just saying that this limitright over here actually exists.And if this limit actually exists,we just call that value F prime of C.So, that's just a review of differentiability.Now, let's give ourselves a review of continuity.Continuity.So, the definition for continuity isif the limit as X approaches C of F of Xis equal to F of C.Now, this might seem a little bit, you know,well, it might pop out to you as being intuitiveor it might seem a little, well, where did this come from,well, let's visualize it and hopefullyit'll make some intuitive sense.So, if you have a function,so, let's actually look at some caseswhere you're not continuous.And that actually might make it a little bit more clear.So, if you had a point discontinuity at X equals C,so, this is X equals C, so, if you hada point discontinuity, so,lemme draw it like this, actually.So, you have a gap, here, and X equals,when X equals C, F of C is actually way up here.So, this is F of C, and then,the function continues like this.The limit, as X approaches C of F of Xis going to be this value, which is clearly differentthan F of C.This value right over here, if you take the limit,if you take the limit as X approaches C of F of X,you're approaching this value.This, right over here, is the limit,as X approaches C of F of X, which is different than F of C.So, it makes it, so, this definition of continuityseems to be good, at least for this case,because this is not a continuous function,you have a point discontinuity.So, for at least in this case, our,this definition of continuity would properlyidentify this as not a continuous function.Now, you could also think about a jump discontinuity.You can also think about a jump discontinuity.So, let's look at this.And all this is, hopefully, a little bit of review.So, a jump discontinuity at C, at X equals C,might look like this.Might look like this.So, this is at X equals C.So, this is X equals C right over here.This would be F of C.But, if you tried to find a value at the limitas X approaches C of F of X,you'd get a different value as you approachC from the negative side, you would approach this value,and as you approach C from the positive side,you would approach F of C, and so, the limit wouldn't exist.So, this limit right over here wouldn't existin the case of jump, of this type of a jump discontinuity.So, once again, this definition would properlysay that this is not, this one right over here,is not continuous, this limit actually would not even exist.And then, you could even look at a,you could look at a function that is truly continuous.If you look at a function that is truly continuous.So, something like this.Something like this.That is X equals C.Well, this is F of C.This is F of C.And if you were to take the limit as X approaches C,as X approaches C from either side of F of X,you're going to approach F of C.So, here, you have the limit as X approaches Cof F of X, indeed, is equal to F of C.So, it's what you would expect for a continuous function.So, now that we've done that reviewof differentiability and continuity,let's prove that differentiabilityactually implies continuity, and I think it's importantto kinda do this review, just so that you canreally visualize things.So, differentiability implies this limitright over here exists.So, let's start with a slightly different limit.Lemme draw a line, here, actually.Lemme draw a line just so we're doing something different.So, let's take, let us take the limitas X approaches C of F of X,of F of X minus F of C.Of F of X minus F of C.Well, can we rewrite this?Well, we could rewrite this as the limit,as X approaches C, and we could essentiallytake this expression and multiplyand divide it by X minus C.So, let's multiply it times X minus C.X minus C, and divide it by X minus C.So, we have F of X minus F of C,all of that over X minus C.So, all I did is I multiplied and I dividedby X minus C.Well, what's this limit going to be equal to?This is going to be equal to,it's going to be the limit, and I'm just applyingthe property of limit, applying a property of limits, here.So, the limit of the product is equal tothe same thing as a product of the limits.So, it's the limit as X approaches C of X minus C,times the limit, lemme write this way,times the limit as X approaches Cof F of X minus F of C,all of that over X minus C.Now, what is this thing right over here?Well, if we assume that F is differentiable at C,and we're going to do that, actually,I should have started off there.Let's assume 'cause we wanted to show the differentiability,it proves continuity.If we assume F differentiable,differentiable at C, well then,this right over here is just going to be F prime of C.This right over here, we just saw it right over here,that's this exact same thing.This is F prime, F prime of C.And what is this thing right over here?The limit as X approaches C of X minus C?Well, that's just gonna be zero.As X approaches C, there's gonna become,approach C minus C, that's just going to be zero.So, what's zero times F prime of C?Well, F prime of C is just going to be some value,so, zero times anything is just going to be zero.So, I did all that work to get a zero.Now, why is this interesting?Well, we just said, we just assumedthat if F is differentiable at C,and we evaluate this limit, we get zero.So, if we assume F is differentiable at C,we can write, we can write the limit,I'm just rewriting it, the limit as X approaches Cof F of X minus F of C, and I could even putparenthesis around it like that,which I already did up here,is equal to zero.Well, this is the same thing,I could use limit properties again,this is the same thing as saying,and I'll do it over, well, actually,lemme do it down here.The limit as X approaches C of F of Xminus the limit as X approaches Cof F of C, of F of C, is equal to zero.The different, the limit of the differenceis the same thing as the difference of the limits.Well, what's this thing over here going to be?Well, F of C is just a number,it's not a function of X anymore,it's just, F of C is going to valuate it to something.So, this is just going to be F of C.This is just going to be F of C.So, the limit of F of X as X approaches C,minus F of C is equal to zero.Well, just add F of C to both sides and what do you get?Well, you get the limit as X approaches Cof F of X is equal to F of C.And this is the definition of continuity.The limit of my function as X approaches Cis equal to the function, is equal to the valueof the function at C.This is, this means that our function is continuous.Continuous at C.So, just a reminder, we started assumingF differentiable at C, we use that factto evaluate this limit right over here,which, we got to be equal to zero,and if that limit is equal to zero,then, it just follows, just doing a little bit of algebraand using properties of limits,that the limit as X approaches C of F of Xis equal to F of C, and that's our definitionof being continuous.Continuous at the point C.So, hopefully, that satisfies you.If we know that the derivative exists at a point,if it's differentiable at a point C,that means it's also continuous at that point C.The function is also continuous at that point.

whether the power rule is giving usresults that at least seem reasonable.This is by no means a proof of the power rule,but at least we'll feel a little bit more comfortable using it.So let's say that f of x is equal to x.The power rule tells us that f primeof x is going to be equal to what?Well, x is the same thing as x to the first power.So n is implicitly 1 right over here.So we bring the 1 out front.It'll be 1 times x to the 1 minus 1 power.So it's going to be 1 times x to the 0 power. x to the 0is just 1.So it's just going to be equal to 1.Now, does that makes conceptual senseif we actually try to visualize these functions?So let me actually try to graph these functions.So that's my y-axis.This is my x-axis.And let me graph y equals x.So y is equal to f of x here.So y is equal to x.So it looks something like that.So y is equal to x.Or this is f of x is equal to x, or yis equal to this f of x right over there.Now, actually, let me just call that f of x justto not confuse you.So this right over here is f of xis equal to x that I graphed right over here.y is equal to f of x, which is equal to x.And now, let me graph the derivative.Let me graph f prime of x.That's saying it's 1.That's saying it's 1 for all x.Regardless of what x is, it's going to be equal to 1.Is this consistent with what we knowabout derivatives and slopes and all the rest?Well, let's look at our function.What is the slope of the tangent line right at this point?Well, right over here, this has slope 1 continuously.Or it has a constant slope of 1.Slope is equal to 1 no matter what x is.It's a line.And for a line, the slope is constant.So over here, the slope is indeed 1.If you go to this point over here, the slope is indeed 1.If you go over here, the slope is indeed 1.So we've got a pretty valid response there.Now, let's try something where the slope might change.So let's say I have g of x is equal to x squared.The power rule tells us that g prime of xwould be equal to what?Well, n is equal to 2.So it's going to be 2 times x to the 2 minus 1.Or it's going to be equal to 2 x to the first power.It's going to be equal to 2x.So let's see if this makes a reasonable sense.And I'm going to try to graph this one a little bit moreprecisely.Let's see how precisely I can graph it.So this is the x-axis, y-axis.Let me mark some stuff off here.So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.This is 1, 2, 3, 4.1, 2, 3, 4.So g of x.When x is 0, it's 0.When x is 1, it is 1.When x is negative 1, it's 1.When x is 2, it is 4.So that puts us right over there-- 1, 2, 3, 4.Puts us right over there.When x is negative 2, you get to 4.It's a parabola.You've seen this for many years.I put that point a little bit too high.It looks something like this.Actually, the last two points I graphed are a little bit weird.So this might be right over here.So it looks something like this.It looks something like that.And then, when you come over here,it looks something like that.It's symmetric.So I'm trying my best to draw it reasonably.So there you go.That's the graph of g of x. g of x is equal to x squared.Now, let's graph g prime of x or what the power rule istelling us a g prime of x is.So g prime of x is equal to 2x.So that's just a line that goes through the origin of slope 2.So it looks something like that.When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 2.When x is equal to 2, y or g of x is equal to 4.So it looks something like this.Let me try my best to draw a straight line.It looks something like this.Now, does this make sense?Well, if you just eyeball it really fast,if you look at this point right over here--and you want to think about the slope of the tangent line.Let me do this in a color that pops out a little bit more.So the tangent line would look something like this.So it looks like it has a reasonably high negative slope.Yeah.It's definitely a negative slope,and it's a pretty steep negative slope.For x is equal to negative 2, g prime of negative 2is equal to 2 times negative 2, which is equal to negative 4.So this is claiming that the slope at this point-- sothis right over here is negative 4--is saying that the slope of this pointis negative 4. m is equal to negative 4.That looks about right.It's a fairly steep negative slope.Now, what happens if you go right over herewhen x is equal to 0?Well, our derivative-- if you say g prime of 0--is telling us that the slope of our original function, g, at xis equal to 0 is 2 times 0 is 0.Well, does that make sense?Well, if we go to our original parabola,it does indeed make sense.That's the slope of the tangent line.The tangent line looks something like this.We're at a minimum point.We're at the vertex.The slope really does look to be 0.And what if you go right over hereto x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line?Well, over here, the tangent line looks something like this.It looks like a fairly steep positive slope.What is our derivative telling us based on the power rule?So this is essentially saying, hey,tell me what the slope of the tangent line for gis when x is equal to 2.Well, we figured it out.It's going to be 2 times x.It's going to be 2 times 2, which is equal to 4.It's telling us that the slope over here is 4.And I'm just using m. m is often the letterused to denote slope.They're saying that the slope of the tangent linethere is 4, which seems completely, completelyreasonable.So I encourage you to try this out yourself.I encourage you to try to estimate the slopesby calculating, by taking points closerand closer around those points.And you'll see that the power rule reallydoes give you results that actually make sense.

Ithink, now that they're done, I think now is good time to dothe proof of the derivative of the general form.Let's take the derivative of x to the n.Now that we know the binomial theorem, wehave the tools to do it.How do we take the derivative?Well, what's the classic definition of the derivative?It is the limit as delta x approaches zero of f ofx plus delta x, right?So f of x plus delta x in this situation is x plus deltax to the nth power, right?Minus f of x, well f of x here is just x to the n.All of that over delta x.Now that we know the binomial theorem we can figure outwhat the expansion of x plus delta x is to the nth power.And if you don't know the binomial theorem, go to mypre-calculus play list and watch the videos onthe binomial theorem.The binomial theorem tells us that this is equal to-- I'mgoing to need some space for this one-- the limit asdelta x approaches zero.And what's the binomial theorem?This is going to be equal to-- I'm just going to do thenumerator-- x to the n plus n choose 1.Once again, review the binomial theorem if this is looks likelatin to you and you don't know latin.n choose 1 of x to the n minus 1 delta x plus n choose 2 x tothe n minus 2, that's x n minus 2, delta x squared.Then plus, and we have a bunch of the digits, and in thisproof we don't have to go through all the digits but thebinomial theorem tells us what they are and, of course, thelast digit we just keep adding is going to be 1-- it wouldbe n choose n which is 1.Let me just write that down. n choose n.It's going to be x to the zero times delta x to the n.So that's the binomial expansion.Let me switch back to minus, green that's x plus delta xto the n, so minus x to the n power.That's x to the n, I know I squashed it there.All of that over delta x.Let's see if we can simplify.First of all we have an x to the n here, and at the very endwe subtract out an x to the n, so these two cancel out.If we look at every term here, every term in the numerator hasa delta x, so we can divide the numerator and thedenominator by delta x.This is the same thing as 1 over delta x timesthis whole thing.So that is equal to the limit as delta x approaches zero of,so we divide the top and the bottom by delta x, or wemultiply the numerator times 1 over delta x.We get n choose 1 x to the n minus 1.What's delta x divided by delta x, that's just 1.Plus n choose 2, x to the n minus 2.This is delta x squared, but we divide by delta x wejust get a delta x here.Delta x.And then we keep having a bunch of terms, we're going to divideall of them by delta x.And then the last term is delta x to the n, but thenwe're going to divide that by delta x.So the last term becomes n choose n, x to the zero is 1,we can ignore that. delta x to the n divided by delta x.Well that's delta x to the n minus 1.Then what are we doing now?Remember, we're taking the limit as deltax approaches zero.As delta x approaches zero, pretty much every term thathas a delta x in it, it becomes zero.When you multiply but zero, you get zero.This first term has no delta x in it, butevery other term does.Every other term, even after we divided by delta xhas a delta x in it.So that's a zero.Every term is zero, all of the other n minus 1terms, they're all zeros.All we're left with is that this is equal to n choose1 of x the n minus 1.And what's n choose 1?That equals n factorial over 1 factorial divided by n minus 1factorial times x to the n minus 1.1 factorial is 1.If I have 7 factorial divided by 6 factorial, that's just 1.Or if I have 3 factorial divided by 2 factorial, that'sjust 3, you can work it out.10 factorial divided by 9 factorial that's 10.So n factorial divided by n minus 1 factorial,that's just equal to n.So this is equal to n times x to the n minus 1.That's the derivative of x to the n. n timesx to the n minus 1.We just proved the derivative for any positive integer whenx to the power n, where n is any positive integer.And we see later it actually works for all realnumbers and the exponent.I will see you in a future video.Another thing I wanted to point out is, you know I said thatwe had to know the binomial theorem.But if you think about it, we really didn't even have to knowthe binomial theorem because we knew in any binomialexpansion-- I mean, you'd have to know a little bit-- but ifyou did a little experimentation you wouldrealize that whenever you expand a plus b to the nthpower, first term is going to be a to the n, and the secondterm is going to be plus n a to the n minus 1 b.And then you are going to keep having a bunch of terms.But these are the only terms that are relevant to this proofbecause all the other terms get canceled out when deltax approaches zero.So if you just knew that you could have done this, but it'smuch better to do it with the binomial theorem.Ignore what I just said if it confused you.I'm just saying that we could have just said the rest ofthese terms all go to zero.Anyway, hopefully you found that fulfilling.I will see you in future videos.

this videois prove that the limitas theta approaches zeroof sine of thetaover theta is equal to one.So let's start with a little bit of a geometricor trigonometric construction that I have here.So this white circle, this is a unit circle,that we'll label it as such.So it has radius one,unitcircle.So what does the lengthof this salmon-colored line represent?Well, the height of this line would be the y-coordinateof where this radius intersects the unit circle.And so by definition, by the unit circle definitionof trig functions, the length of this lineis going to be sine of theta.If we wanted to make sure that also worked for thetasthat end up in the fourth quadrant, which will be useful,we can just insure that it's the absolute valueof the sine of theta.Now what about this blue line over here?Can I express that in terms of a trigonometric function?Well, let's think about it.What would tangent of theta be?Let me write it over here.Tangent of thetais equal to opposite over adjacent.So if we look at this broader triangle right over here,this is our angle theta in radians.This is the opposite side.The adjacent side down here, this just has length one.Remember, this is a unit circle.So this just has length one,so the tangent of theta is the opposite side.The opposite side is equal to the tangent of theta.And just like before, this is going to be a positive valuefor sitting here in the first quadrantbut I want things to workin both the first and the fourth quadrantfor the sake of our proof,so I'm just gonna put an absolute value here.So now that we've done,I'm gonna think about some trianglesand their respective areas.So first, I'm gonna draw a trianglethat sits in this wedge, in this pie piece,this pie slice within the circle,so I can construct this triangle.And so let's think about the areaof what I am shading in right over here.How can I express that area?Well, it's a triangle.We know that the area of a triangleis 1/2 base times height.We know the heightis the absolute value of the sine of thetaand we know that the base is equal to one,so the area here is going to be equal to 1/2times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of the sine of theta.I'll rewrite it over here.I can just rewrite thatas the absolute value of the sine of theta over two.Now let's think about the area of this wedgethat I am highlighting in this yellow color.So what fraction of the entire circle is this going to be?If I were to go all the way around the circle,it would be two pi radians,so this is theta over to two pis of the entire circleand we know the area of the circle.This is a unit circle, it has a radius one,so it'd be times the area of the circle,which would be pi times the radius square,the radius is one, so it's just gonna be times pi.And so the area of this wedge right over here,theta over two.And if we wanted to make this workfor thetas in the fourth quadrant,we could just write an absolute value sign right over there'cause we're talking about positive area.And now let's think about this larger trianglein this blue color, and this is pretty straightforward.The area here is gonna be 1/2 times base times height.So the area, and once again, this is this entire are,that's going to be 1/2 times our base, which is one,times our height,which is the absolute value of tangent of theta.And so I can just write that downas the absolute value of the tangent of theta over two.Now, how would you compare the areasof this pink or this salmon-colored trianglewhich sits inside of this wedgeand how do you compare that area of the wedgeto the bigger triangle?Well, it's clear that the area of the salmon triangleis less than or equal to the area of the wedgeand the area of the wedge is less than or equal tothe area of the big, blue triangle.The wedge includes the salmon triangleplus this area right over here,and then the blue triangle includes the wedgeplus it has this area right over here.So I think we can feel good visuallythat this statement right over here is trueand I'm just gonna doa little bit of algebraic manipulation.Let me multiply everything by twoso I can rewrite that the absolute valueof sine of theta is less than or equal tothe absolute value of thetawhich is less than or equal to the absolute valueof tangent of theta, and let's see.Actually, instead of writing the absolute valueof tangent of theta, I'm gonna rewrite thatas the absolute value of sine of thetaover the absolute value of cosine of theta.That's gonna be the same thingas the absolute value of tangent of theta.And the reason why I did thatis we can now divide everythingby the absolute value of sine of theta.Since we're dividing by a positive quantity,it's not going to change the direction of the inequalities.So let's do thatI'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of sine of theta.I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of thetaand then I'm gonna divide thisby an absolute value of the sine of theta.And what do I get?Well, over here, I get a oneand on the right-hand side, I get a oneover the absolute value of cosine theta.These two cancel out.So the next step I'm gonna dois take the reciprocal of everything.And so when I take the reciprocal of everything,that actually will switch the inequalities.The reciprocal of one is still going to be onebut now, since I'm taking the reciprocal of this here,it's gonna be greater than or equal tothe absolute value of the sine of thetaover the absolute value of theta,and that's going to be greater than or equal tothe reciprocal of oneover the absolute value of cosine of thetais the absolute value of cosine of theta.We really just care about the first and fourth quadrants.You can think about this thetaapproaching zero from that directionor from that direction there,so that would be the first and fourth quadrants.So if we're in the first quadrant and theta is positive,sine of theta is gonna be positive as well.And if we're in the fourth quadrant and theta's negative,well, sine of theta is gonna have the same sign.It's going to be negative as well.And so these absolute value signs aren't necessary.In the first quadrant,sine of theta and theta are both positive.In the fourth quadrant, they're both negative,but when you divide them,you're going to get a positive value, so I can erase those.If we're in the first or fourth quadrant,our X value is not negative,and so cosine of theta, which is the x-coordinateon our unit circle, is not going to be negative,and so we don't need the absolute value signs over there.Now, we should pause a secondbecause we're actually almost done.We have just set up three functions.You could think of this as f of x is equal to,you could view this as f of theta is equal to one,g of theta is equal to this,and h of theta is equal to that.And over the interval that we care about,we could say for negative pi over twois less than theta is less than pi over two,but over this interval, this is true for any thetaover which these functions are defined.Sine of theta over theta is defined over this interval,except where theta is equal to zero.But since we're defined everywhere else,we can now find the limit.So what we can say is, well, by the squeeze theoremor by the sandwich theorem,if this is true over the interval,then we also know that the following is true.And this, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.The limitas theta approaches zero of thisis going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this,which is the one that we care about,sine of theta over theta,which is going to be greater than or equal to the limitas theta approaches zero of this.Now this is clearly going to be just equal to one.This is what we care about.And this, what's the limit as theta approaches zeroof cosine of theta?Well, cosine of zero is just oneand it's a continuous function,so this is just gonna be one.So let's see.This limit is going to be less than or equal to oneand it's gonna be greater than or equal to one,so this must be equal to oneand we are done.

0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-definition-and-basic-rules/cs1-proof-videos/v/derivative-of-cos-x	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What I wanna do in this videois make a visual argument as to why the derivative withrespect to x of cosine of x is equal to negative sine of x.And we're gonna base this argument,based on a previous proof we madethat the derivative with respect to x of sine of xis equal to cosine of x.So we're gonna assume this over here.I encourage you to watch that video.That's actually a fairly involved proof that proves this,but if we assume this, I'm gonna make a visual argumentthat this right over here is the derivativewith respect to x of cosine of x is negative sine of x.So right over here we seen sine of x in redand we see cosine of x in blue.And we're assuming that this blue graphis showing the derivative, the slope of the tangent linefor any x value of the red graph.And we've got an intuition for that in previous videos.Now what I'm gonna do next,is I'm gonna shift both of these graphsto the left by pi over two.Shift it to the left by pi over twoand I'm also gonna shift the blue graph to the leftby pi over two.And so what am I going to get?Well the blue graph is gonna look like this oneright over here and if it was cosine of x up here,we can now say that this is equal toy is equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.This is the blue graph,cosine of x, shifted to the left by pi over two.And this is y is equal to sine of x plus pi over two.Now the visual argument is, all I did,is I shifted both of these graphsto the left by pi over two.So it should still be the case that the derivativeof the red graph is the blue graph.So we should still be able to saythat the derivative with respect to x of the red graph,sin of x plus pi over twothat that is equal to the blue graph.That that is equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.Now what is sin of x plus pi over two?Well that's the same thing as cosine of x.You can see this red graph is the same thing as cosine of x.We know that from our trig identitiesand you can also see in intuitively or graphicallyjust by looking at these graphs.Now what is cosine of x plus pi over two?Well once again, from our trig identities,we know that that is the exact same thingas negative sine of x.So there you have it, the visual argument.Just start with this knowledge,shift both of these graphs to the left by pi over two,it should still be true,that the derivative with respect to xof sine of x plus pi over twois equal to cosine of x plus pi over two.And this is the same thing as saying what we haveright over here.So now we should feel pretty good.We proved this in a previous videoand we have a very strong visual argument for thisfor cosine of x in this video.

0	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1/cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics/cs1-chain-rule/v/chain-rule-introduction	khanacademy	video	:00- [Instructor] What we're going to go overin this video is one of the core principles in calculus,and you're going to use it any time you take the derivative,anything even reasonably complex.And it's called the chain rule.And when you're first exposed to it,it can seem a little daunting and a little bit convoluted.But as you see more and more examples,it'll start to make sense, and hopefully it'd even startto seem a little bit simple and intuitive over time.So let's say that I had a function.Let's say I have a function h of x, and it is equal to,just for example, let's say it's equal to sine of x,let's say it's equal to sine of x squared.Now, I could've written that,I could've written it like this,sine squared of x, but it'll be a little bit clearerusing that type of notation.So let me make it so I have h of x.And what I'm curious about is what is h prime of x?So I want to know h prime of x,which another way of writing it isthe derivative of h with respect to x.These are just different notations.And to do this, I'm going to use the chain rule.I'm going to use the chain rule,and the chain rule comes into play every time,any time your function can be used as a compositionof more than one function.And as that might not seem obvious right now,but it will hopefully,maybe by the end of this video or the next one.Now, what I want to dois a little bit of a thought experiment,a little bit of a thought experiment.If I were to ask youwhat is the derivative with respect to x,if I were to just apply the derivative operatorto x squared with respect to x, what do I get?Well, this gives me two x.We've seen that many, many, many, many times.Now, what if I were to take the derivative with respect to aof a squared?Well, it's the exact same thing.I just swapped an a for the x's.This is still going to be equal to two a.Now I will do somethingthat might be a little bit more bizarre.What if I were to take the derivative with respect tosine of x,with respect to sine of x of,of sine of x,sine of x squared?Well, wherever I had the x's up here, the a's over here,I just replace it with a sine of x.So this is just going to be two times the thing that I had,so whatever I'm taking the derivative with respect to.Here it was with respect to x.Here with respect to a.Here's with respect to sine of x.So it's going to be two timessine of x.Now, so the chain rule tells usthat this derivative is going to be the derivativeof our whole function with respect,or the derivative of this outer function, x squared,the derivative of x squared,the derivative of this outer functionwith respect to sine of x.So that's going to be two sine of x,twosine of x.So we could view it as the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner, two sine of x.We could just treat sine of x like it's kind of an x.And it would've been just two x,but instead it's a sine of x.We say two sine of x times,times the derivative, do this is green,times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x.Times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x,well, that's more straightforward,a little bit more intuitive.The derivative of sine of xwith respect to x, we've seen multiple times,is cosine of x,so times cosine of x.And so there we've applied the chain rule.It was the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner.So derivative of sine of x squaredwith respect to sine of x is two sine of x,and then we multiply that times the derivative of sine of xwith respect to x.So let me make it clear.This right over here is the derivative.We're taking the derivative of,we're taking the derivative of sine of x squared.So let me make it clear.That's what we were taking the derivative ofwith respect to sine of x,with respect to sine of x.And then we're multiplying that timesthe derivative of sine of x,the derivative of sineof xwith respect to,with respect to x.And this is where it might start makinga little bit of intuition.You can't really treat these differentials,this d whatever, this dx, this d sine of x,as a number.And you really can't,this notation makes it look like a fractionbecause intuitively that's what we're doing.But if you were to treat 'em like fractions,then you could think about canceling that and that.And once again, this isn't a rigorous thing to do,but it can help with the intuition.And then what you're left with is the derivativeof this whole sine of x squared with respect to x.So you're left with,you're left with the derivative ofessentially our original function, sine of x squaredwith respect to x,with respect to x, which is exactly what dh/dx is.This right over here,this right over here is our original function h.That's our original function h.So it might seem a little bit daunting now.What I'll do in the next video is another several examples,and then we'll try to abstract this a little bit.

videois focus on key misunderstandings that folks often have,and we actually got these misunderstandingsfrom the folks who write the AP exams,from the actual College Board.So let's say that we are trying to takethe derivative of the expression.So let's say we're taking the derivativeof the expression,the natural log of sine of x.So the first key misconception or misunderstandingthat many people haveis when you're dealingwith transcendental functions like this,and transcendental functions is just a fancy wordfor these functions like trigonometric functions,logarithmic functions,that don't use standard algebraic operations.But when you see transcendental functions like thisor compositions of them,many people confuse this with the product of functions.So at first when they look at this,they might see this as being the sameas the derivative with respect to xof natural log of x,natural log of x, times sine of x.And you can see just the way that it's written,they look very similar,but this is the product of two functions.If you said natural log of x is f of x,and sine of x is g of x,this is the product of sine and g of x,sorry this is the product of f of x and g of x,and here you would use the product rule.So to actually compute this,you would use the product, the product rule.But this is a composition.Here you have f of g of x,not f of x times g of x.So here you havethat is our g of x, it equals sine of x,and then our f of g of xis the natural log of sine of x.So this is f of g of x,f of g of x just like that.If someone asks you just what f of x was,well that would be natural log of x,but f of g of x is natural log of our g of x,which is natural log of sine of x.So that's the key first thing,always make sure whether you're gonna use,especially with these transcendental functions,that hey if this is a composition you've gotta usethe chain rule, not the product rule.It's not the product.Now sometimes you have a combination,you have a product of compositions,and then things get a little bit more involved.But pay close attention to make surethat you're not dealing with a composition.Now the next misconception students haveis even if they recognize,okay I've gotta use the chain rule,sometimes it doesn't go fully to completion.So let's continue using this example.The chain rule here says,look we have to take the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the inner function.So if I were to say,in this case, f of x is natural log of x,f of g of x is this expression here.So if I wanna do this first part,f prime of g of x,f prime of g of x,well the derivative of the natural log of xis one over x.So the natural log, derivative of natural log of xis one over x,but we don't want the derivative where the input is x.We want the derivative when the input is g of x.So instead of it being one over x,it's gonna be one over g of x.One over g of x,and we know that g of x is equal to sine of x.That's equal to sine of x.Now one key misunderstanding that the folksof the College Board told us aboutis many students stop right there.They just do this first part,and then they forget to multiply this second part.So here we are not done.We need to take this and multiply it times g prime of x.And let me write this down.g prime of x, what would that be?Well the derivative of sine of x with respect to x,well that's just going to be cosine of x,cosine of x.So in this example right over here,the derivative is going to be,let's see if I can squeeze it in over here,it's going to be one over sine of x which is this part,times cosine of x.So let me write it down.It is going to be one over sine of x,we'll do that in that other color,one over sine of x,and then times cosine of x.So once again,just to make sure that you don't fall intoone of these misconceptions.Let me box this off so it's a little bit,it's a little bit cleaner.So to just make sure that you don't fallinto one of these misconceptions here,recognize the composition,that this is not the product of natural log of xand sine of x.It's natural log of sine of x.And then when you're actually applying the chain rule,derivative of the outside with respect to the inside,so the derivative of natural log of x is one over x,so that applied when the input is g of xis one over sine of x.And then multiply that times the derivativeof the inner function.So don't forget to do this right over here.Now another misconception that students have,is instead of doing what we just did,instead of applying the chain rule like this,they take the derivative of the outer functionwith respect to the derivative of the inner function.So for example,they would compute this,f prime of g prime of x,f prime of g prime of x.Which in this case, f prime of x is one over x,but if the input is g prime of x,g prime of x is cosine of x.So many students end up doing thiswhere they take the derivative of the outside,and they apply the input into that,they use the derivative of the inside function.This is not right.Be very careful that you're not doing that.You do the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside function,not taking it's derivative,and then multiply, don't forget to multiply,times the derivative of the inside function here.So hopefully that helps a little bit.If all of this looks completely foreign to you,I encourage you to watch the whole seriesof chain rule introductory videosand worked examples we have.This is just a topping on top of thatto make sure that you don't fall into these misconceptionsof applying the product rulewhen you really need to be applying the chain ruleor forgetting to do part of the chain rule,multiplying by g prime of x,or evaluating f prime of g prime of x.So hopefully that helps.

we're running out of variables,although there are a lot of letters left.So if I say h of x is just equal to the cosineof whatever I input, so it's equal to the cosine of x,well then h of w of u of xis gonna be g of x.Let me write that down.H of w of u of x,u of x, is going to be equal to,remember, h of x takes the cosineof whatever its input is,so it's gonna take the cosine.Now its input is w of u of x.We already figured out w of u of xis going to be this business.So it's going to be sine of x plus one,where the u of x is sine of x,but then we input that into w,so we got sine of x plus one,and then we inputed that into hto get cosine of that,which is our original expression,which is equal to g of x.So the whole point here is to appreciatehow to recognize compositions of functions.Now I wanna stress, it's not alwaysgoing to be a composition of a function.For example, if I have some function,let me just clear this out,if I had some function f of xis equal to cosine of x times sine of x,it would be hard to express this asa composition of functions,but I can represent it as the product of functions.For example, I could say cosine of x,I could say u of x is equal to cosine of x.And I could say v of x, it's a different color,I could say v of xis equal to sine of x.And so here, f of x wouldn't be the compositionof u and v, it would be the product.F of x is equal to u of xtimes v of x.If we were take the composition,if we were to say u of v of x,pause the video, think about what that is,and that's a little bit of review.Well this is going to be, I take u of xtakes the cosine of whatever is input,and now the input is v of x, which would be sine of x;sine of x.And then if you did v of u of x,well that'd be the other way around.It would be sine of cosine of x.But anyway, this is once again, just tohelp us recognize, hey, do I have,when I look at an expression or a function definition,am I looking at products of functions,am I looking at compositions of functions?Sometimes you're looking at products of compositionsor quotients of compositions,all sorts of different combinations of howyou can put functions together to create new functions.

we have the function f of xwhich is equal to cosine of x to the third powerwhich we could also write like this,cosine of x to the third power.And we are interested in figuring outwhat f prime of x is going to be equal to.So we want to figure out f prime of x and as we will see,the chain rule is going to be very useful hereand what I'm going to do isI'm going to first just apply the chain ruleand then maybe dig into it a little bitto make sure we draw the connectionbetween what we're doing here and then what you might seein maybe some of your Calculus textbooksthat explain the chain rule.So if we have a functionthat is defined as essentially a composite function,notice this expression right here,we are taking something to the third power.It isn't just an x that we're taking to the third power.We are taking a cosine of x to the third power.So we're taking a function, you could view it this way,we're taking the function cosine of xand then we're inputting it in to another functionthat takes it to the third power.So let me put it this way.If you viewed,if you say, look, we could take an x,we put it into one function and that is,that first function is cosine of xso first, we evaluate the cosineand so that's going to produce cosine of x,cosine of x,and then we're going to input it into a functionthat just takes things to the third power.So it just takes things to the third power.And so what are you going to end up with?Well, you're going to end up with,what are you taking to the third power?You're taking cosine of x.Cosine of x to the third power.This is a composite function.You could view this,you could view this as the function,let's call this blue one, the function vand let's call this the function uand so if we're taking x and into u,this is u of xand then if we're taking u of x into the inputor as the input into the function vthen this output right over here,this is going to be v of,well, what was inputted?V of u of x.V of u of xor another way of writing it,I'm going to write it multiple ways.That's the same thing as v of cosine of x.V of cosine of x.And so v, whatever you input into it,it just takes it to the third power.If you were to write v of x,it would be x to the third power.So the chain rule tells usor the chain rule is what our brain should say.Hey, it becomes applicableif we're going to take the derivative of a functionthat can be expressed as a composite function like this.So just to be clear, we can write f of x.f of x is equal to v of u of x.I know I'm essentially saying the same thingover and over againbut I'm saying it in slightly different waysbecause the first time you learn this,it can be a little bit hard to grokor really deeply understandso I'm going to try to write it in different ways.And the chain rule tells usthat if you have a situation like thisthen the derivative, f prime of x,and this is something that you will see in your textbooks.Well, this is going to bethe derivative of this whole thingwith respect to u of xso we could write that as v prime of u of x.V prime of u of xtimes the derivative of u with respect to x.Times u prime of x.This right over here,this is one expression of the chain ruleand so how do we evaluate it in this case?Well, let me color code it in a similar way.So the v function,this outer thing that just takes things to the third power,I'll put in blue.So f prime of x,another way of expressing itand I'll use it with more of the differential notation,you could view this as the derivative of,well, I'll write it a couple of different ways.You could view it as the derivative of v.The derivative of vwith respect to u.I want to get the colors right.The derivative of v with respect to u,that's what this thing is right over here,times the derivative of uwith respect to x.So times the derivative of u with respect to x.And just to be clear,so you're familiar with the different notationsyou'll see in different textbooks,this is this right over here just using different notationsand this is this right over here.So let's actually evaluate these things.You're probably tired of just talking in the abstract.So this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal toand I'm going to write it out again,this is the derivative,instead of just writing v and u,I'm going to write it, let me write this way.This is going to be,I keep wanting, I'm using the wrong colors.This is going to be the derivative of,and I'm going to leave some space,times the derivative of something elsewith respect to something elseso we're going to have to first take the derivative of v.Well, v iscosine of x to the third power.Cosine of x.We're going to take the derivative of thatwith respect to u which is just cosine of xand we're going to multiply thattimes the derivative of u which is cosine of xwith respect to x.With respect to x.So this one, we have good,we've seen this before.We know that the derivative with respect to xof cosine of x.Cosine.We use it in that same color.The derivative of cosine of x,well, that's equal to negative sine of x.So this one right over here, that is negative sine of x.You might be more familiar with seeingthe derivative operated this waybut in theory, you won't see this as oftenbut this helps my brain really grok what we're doing.We're taking the derivative of cosine of xwith respect to x.Well, that's going to be negative sine of x.Well, what about taking the derivativeof cosine of x to the third powerwith respect to cosine of x?What is this thing over here mean?Well, if I were taking the derivative,if I was taking the derivative of,let me write it this way,if I was taking the derivative of x to the third power,x to the third power with respect to x,if it was like that,well, this is just going to beand let me put some brackets hereto make it a little bit clear.If I'm taking the derivative of that,that is going to be,that is going to be,we bring the exponent out front.That's going to be three,three times x.Three times x to the second power.Three times x to the second power.So the general notion here isif I'm taking the derivative of something,whatever this something happens to be,let me do this in a new color.I'm doing the derivative of orange circle to the third powerwith respect to orange circle.Well, that's just going to be three times orangeor yellow circle.Let me make it an actual orange circle.So the derivative of orange circle to the third powerwith respect to orange circle,that's going to be three times the orange circle squared.So if I'm taking the derivative of cosine of xto the third power with respect to cosine of x,well, that's just going to be,this is just going to bethree times cosine of x,cosine of x to the second power.To the second power.Notice, one way to think about it.I'm taking the derivative of this outside functionwith respect to the inside.So I would do the same thingas taking the derivative of x to the third powerbut instead of an x, I have a cosine of xso instead of it being three x squared,it is three cosine of x squaredand then the chain rule says,if we want to get finally getthe derivative with respect to x,we then take the derivative of cosine of xwith respect to x.I know that's a big mouthful but we are at the homestretch.We've now figured out the derivative.It's going to be this times this.So let's see, that's going to be negative three,negative three times sine of xtimes cosine squared of xand I know that was kind of a long way of saying it.I'm trying to explain the chain rule at the same time.But once you get the hang of it, you're just going to say,alright, well, let me take the derivative of the outsideof something to the third power with respect to the inside.Let me just treat that cosine of x like as if it was an x.Well, that's going to be,if I do that, that's going to be three cosine squared of xso that's that part and that partand then let me take the derivative of the insidewith respect to x.Well, that is negative sine of x.

here f of xbeing equal to the natural log of the square root of x.And what we wanna do in this videois find the derivative of f.And the key here is to recognize that f can actuallybe viewed as a composition of two functions.And we can diagram that out, what's going on here?Well if you input an x into our function f,what's the first thing that you do?Well, you take the square root of it.So if we start off with some x, you input it,the first thing that you do, you take the square root of it.You are going to take the square root of the inputto produce the square root of x,and then what do you do?You take the square root and thenyou take the natural log of that.So then you take the natural log of that,so you could view that as inputting itinto another function that takes the natural logof whatever is inputted in.I'm making these little squares toshow what you do with the input.And then what do you produce?Well you produce the natural log of the square root of x.Natural log of the square root of x.Which is equal to f of x.So you could view f of x as this entire set,or this entire, I guess you could say,this combination of functions right over there.That is f of x, which is essentially,a composition of two functions.You're inputting into one functionthen taking that output and inputting it into another.So you could have a function u here,which takes the square root of whatever its input is,so u of x is equal to the square root of x.And then you take that output,and input it into another function that we could call v,and what does v do?Well it take the natural log of whatever the input is.In this case, in the case of f, or in the case of howI just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log,the input happens to be square root of x,so it outputs the natural log of the square root of x.If we wanted to write v with x as an input,we would just say well that's the natural log,that is just the natural log of x.And as you can see here, f of x,and I color-coded ahead of time,is equal to, f of x is equal to,the natural log of the square root of x.So that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x.So it is a composition which tells you that,okay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here,the chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful.And the chain rule tells us that f prime of xis going to be equal to the derivative of,you can view it as the outside function,with respect to this inside function,so it's going to be v prime of u of x,v prime of u of x,times the derivative of this inside functionwith respect to x.So that's just u prime, u prime of x.So how do we evaluate these things?Well, we know how to take the derivative of u of xand v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to,well remember, square root of x is just the same thingas x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule,bring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the,and then take off one out of that exponent,so that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power.And what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x?Well the derivative of the natural log of xis one over x, we show that in other videos.And so we now know what u prime of x is,we know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x?Well v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x,we replace it, let me write that a little bit neater,we replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of xis going to be equal to,is going to be equal to one over u of x,one over u of x, which is equal to,which is equal to one over,u of x is just the square root of x.One over the square root of x.This thing right over here, we have figured out,is one over the square root of x,and this thing, u prime of x, we figured out,is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2,and x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2times one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thingas 1/2 times one over the square root of x,or I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x.So what is this thing going to be?Well this is going to be equal to, in green,v prime of u of x is one over the square root of x,times, times, u prime of x is one over two timesthe square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to?Well, this is going to be equal to,this is just algebra at this point,one over, we have our two and square root of xtimes square root of x is just x.So it just simplifies to one over two x.So hopefully this made sense,and I intentionally diagrammed it outso that you start to get that muscle in your brain goingof recognizing the composite functions,and then making a little bit more sense ofsome of these expressions of the chain rulethat you might see in your calculus class,or in your calculus textbook.But as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it,essentially, without having to write out all of this.You'll say okay, look, I have a composition.This is the natural log of the square root of x,this is v of u of x.So what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivativeof this outside function with respectto this inside function.So the derivative of natural log of something,with respect to that something, is one over that something.So it is one over that something,the derivative natural log of somethingwith respect to that something is one over that something,so that's what we just did here.One way to think about it, what would natural log of x be?Well that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x.It's one over square root of x,so it's going to be one over the square root of x,so you take the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside one,and then you multiply that times

So let's say that we have y is equal tothe secant of three pi over two minus x.And what we wanna do is, we wanna figure out whatdy/dx is, the derivative of y with respect to x is,at x equal pi over four.Like always, pause this video and see if you couldfigure it out.Well as you can see here, we have a composite function.We're taking the secant, not just of x,but you could view this as of another expressionthat x could define, or as of a, of another function.So for example, if you call this right over here, u of x,let's do that.So if we say u of x is equal to three pi over two minus x,we could also figure out u prime of xis going to be equal to derivative of three pi over two,that's just going to be a zero,derivative of minus x, well that's just gonna beminus one, and you could just view that as a power rule.It's one times negative one, times x to the zero power,which is just one.So there you go.So we could view this as the derivative of the secantwith respect to u of x, that when we take the derivative,the derivative of secant with respect to u of x,times the derivative of u with respect to x.And you might say,""Well, what about the derivative of secant?""Well in other videos, we actually prove it out,and you could actually re-derive it.Secant is just one over cosine of x,so it comes straight out of the chain rule.So, in other videos, we prove that the,the derivative of the secant of x,of the secant of x, is equal to, is equal to sin of x,over cosine of x, over cosine of x squared.So if we're trying to find the derivative of ywith respect to x, well it's going to be the derivativeof secant with respect to u of x,times the derivative of u with respect to x.So let's do that.The derivative of secant with respect to u of x,well, instead of seeing an x everywhere,you're gonna see a u of x everywhere.So this is going to be,sin of u of x,sin of u of x,and I could, I don't have to write u of x,I could write three pi over two minus x,but I'll write u of x right over here just toreally visualize what we're doing.So sin of u of x,over,over,cosine squared of u of x,cosine squared,and we do those parentheses in the blue colorjust to make sure that you identify itwith the trig function.So cosine squared of u of x, u of x,so that's the derivative of secant with respect to u of x,and then the chain rule tells us it's gonna bethat times u prime, u prime of x.So what is this going to be equal to?Well, I could just substitute back.This is going to be equal to, I will write it like this.Sin of u of x, which is three pi over two minus x,and I'll fill that in in a second,over cosine of u of x squared,times u prime of x,u of x is three pi over two minus x,three pi over two minus x.And then u prime of x, we already figured out,is negative one, so I could write,times negative one, oh, yeah.Let me just leave it out there for now.I could have just put a negative out front,but I really want you to be able to seewhat I'm doing here.And now we want to evaluate at x equals pi over four.So that is equal to pi over four.Pi over four.So let's see, this is going to be,this is going to be equal to sin of,what's three pi over two minus pi over four?I'll do that over here.So we have a common denominator,that is six pi over four,the same thing as three pi over two,minus pi over four,minus pi over four, is equal to five,five pi over four.So it's sin of five pi over four,five pi over four,over cosine squared of five pi over four,and then times negative one, I can just put that out here.Now what is sin of five pi over fourand cosine squared of five pi over four?Well, I don't have that memorized, but,let's actually draw a unit circleand we should be able to,we should be able to figure out what that is.So, a unit circle,I try to hand draw it as best as I can.Please forgive me that this circle does not lookreally like a circle, alright.Okay.So, let me just remember my angles.So, I, I in my brain, I sometimes convert into degrees.Pi over four is 45 degrees.This is pi over two, this is three pi over four,this is four pi over four,this is five pi over four,lands you right over there.So if you wanted to see where you intersect the unit circle,this is at the point, this is at the point.Your x-coordinate is negative square root of two over two,negative square root of two over two,and your y-coordinate is negative square rootof two over two.If you are wondering how I got that,I encourage you to review the unit circleand some of the standard angles around the unit circle.You'll see that in the trigonometry sectionof Khan Academy.But this is enough for us, because the sinis the y-coordinate, it's the y-coordinate here.So negative square root of two over two.So this is negative square root of two over two.And then, the cosine is the x-coordinate,which is also negative square root of two over two,it's going to be that squared.Negative square root of two over two, we're squaring it.So if we square this, it's gonna become,this is going to become, it's gonna become positive.And then square root of two squared is two,and then two squared is four.So it's one half.So this is, the denominator's equal to one half.See the numerator, this negativecancels out with that negative.And so we are left with,we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.We are left with square root of two over two,that's the numerator,divided by one half, well that's the same thingas multiplying by two.So we are left with positive square root of two,is the slope of the tangent line,to the graph of y is equal to thiswhen x is equal to pi over four.Pretty exciting."

Let's see if we can take the derivativewith respect to x of the fourth rootof x to the third power plus four x squared plus seven.And at first you might say, ""All right,""how do I take the derivative of the fourth root""of something, it looks like I have a composite function,""I'm taking the fourth root of another expression?""And you'd be right.And if you're dealing with a composite function,the chain rule should be front of mind.But first, let's just make this fourth roota little bit more tractable for us.And just realize that this fourth rootis nothing but a fractional exponent.So this is the same thing as the derivativewith respect to x of x to the third plus four x squaredplus seven to the 1/4 power,to the 1/4 power.Now, how do we take the derivative of this?Well, we can view this, as I said a few seconds ago,we can view this as a composite function.What do we do first with our x?Well, we do all of this business,and we can call this u of x.And then whatever we get for u of x,we raise that to the fourth power.So the way that we would take the derivative,we would take the derivative of this,you could view it as the outer functionwith respect to u of x and then multiply thattimes the derivative of u with respect to x.So let's do that.So what this is going to be,this is going to be equal to,so we're gonna take our outside function,which I'm highlighting in green now,so, or I take something to the 1/4,I'm gonna take the derivative of that with respectto the inside, with respect to u of x.Well, I'm just gonna use the power rule here.I'm just gonna bring that 1/4 out front,so it's gonna be 1/4 timeswhatever I'm taking the derivative with respect to,to the 1/4 minus one power.Look, all I did was use the power rule here.I didn't have an x here.Now I'm taking the derivative with respect to u of x,with respect to this polynomial expression here.So I could just throw the u of x in here if I like,actually let me just do that.So, this is going to be x to the thirdplus four x squared plus seven.And then I wanna multiply that,and this is the chain rule.I took the derivative of the outsidewith respect to the inside and then I'm gonna multiply thattimes the derivative of the inside.So what's the derivative of u of x?U prime of x, let's see we just gonna usethe power rule a bunch of times,it's gonna be three x squaredplus two times four is eight xto the two minus one is just one power, first power,so I can just write that as eight x,and then the derivative with respect to x of seven,well, the derivative with respect to x of a constantis just gonna be zero.So that's u prime of x.So then I'm just gonna multiply by u prime of xwhich is three x squared plus,three x squared plus eight x.And so, well, I can clean this up a little bit,so this would be equal to,this would be equal to.Actually let me just rewrite that exponent there.So this 1/4 minus one, I can rewrite it,1/4 minus one is negative 3/4,negative 3/4,negative 3/4 power.And you can manipulate this in different ways, if you like,but the key is to just recognize that this isan application of the chain rule.Derivative of the outside, well, actually,the first thing to realize is the fourth rootis the same thing as taking something to the 1/4 power,basic exponent property, and then realize,okay, I have a composite function here.So I can take the derivative of the outsidewith respect to the inside, that's what we did here,times the derivative of the inside with respect to x.And so if someone were to tell you,if someone were to say, ""All right, f of x,""f of x is equal to the fourth root of""x to the third plus four x squared plus seven,""and then they said, ""Well, what is f prime of""I don't know, negative three?""Well, you would evaluate this at negative three.So let me just do that.So it's 1/4 times,see, you have negative 27,I hope this works out reasonably well,plus 36, plus 36,plus 7 to the negative 3/4,what does this result to?This is going to be equal to,this right over here is 16, right?Negative 27 plus seven is negative 20plus 36, so this is 16.I think this is going to work out nicely.And then timesthree times negative, so three times nine,which is 27 minus 24.So this is going to be right over here,that is going to be three.Now, what is 16 to the negative 3/4?So this is 1/4 times, so 16 times to the 1/4is two and then you raise that to the,let me, actually I don't want to skip steps here.At this point we're dealing with algebra,or maybe even pre-algebra.So this is going to be times, times,16 to the 1/4,and then we're gonna raise that to the negative threetimes that three out front.So we could put that three there.16 to the 1/4 is two,two to the third is eight,so two to the negative third power is 1/8,so that is 1/8.So we have 3/4 times 1/8which is equal to three over 32, 3/32.So that would be the slope of the tangent lineof the graph y is equal to f of xwhen x is equal to negative three."

equation x squaredplus y squared is equal to 1.I guess we could call it a relationship.And if we were to graph all of the points x and ythat satisfied this relationship,we get a unit circle like this.And what I'm curious about in this videois how we can figure out the slope of the tangent lineat any point of this unit circle.And what immediately might be jumping out in your brain is,well a circle defined this way, this isn't a function.It's not y explicitly defined as a function of x.For any x value we actually have two possible y'sthat satisfy this relationship right over here.So you might be tempted to maybe split this upinto two separate functions of x.You could say y is equal to the positive square root of 1minus x squared.And you could say y is equal to the negative square root of 1minus x squared.Take the derivatives of each of these separately.And you would be able to find the derivative for any x,or the derivative of the slope of the tangent lineat any point.But what I want to do in this videois literally leverage the chain ruleto take the derivative implicitly.So that I don't have to explicitly define yis a function of x either way.And the way we do that is literally justapply the derivative operator to both sides of this equation.And then apply what we know about the chain rule.Because we are not explicitly defining yas a function of x, and explicitly getting yis equal to f prime of x, they callthis-- which is really just an application of the chain rule--we call it implicit differentiation.And what I want you to keep in the back of your mindthe entire time is that it's justan application of the chain rule.So let's apply the derivative operator to both sides of this.So it's the derivative with respectto x of x squared plus y squared, on the left handside of our equation.And then that's going to be equal to the derivativewith respect to x on the right hand side.I'm just doing the same exact thingto both sides of this equation.Now if I take the derivative of the sum of two terms,that's the same thing as taking the sum of the derivative.So this is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to x of x squared,plus the derivative with respect to x of y squared.I'm writing all my orange stuff first.So let's see.This is going to be x squared, this is going to be y squared.And then this is going to be equal to the derivativewith respect to x of a constant.This isn't changing with respect to x.So we just get 0.Now this first term right over here,we have done many, many, many, many, many, many times.The derivative with respect to x of x squaredis just the power rule here.It's going to be 2 times x to the first power.We could just say 2x.Now what's interesting is what we're doing right over here.The derivative with respect to x of y squared.And the realization here is to just apply the chain rule.If we're taking the derivative with respectto x of this something, we just haveto take the derivative-- let me make it clear--we're just going to take the derivative of our something.The derivative of y squared-- that's what we're taking,you can kind of view that as a function-- with respect to yand then multiply that times the derivative of ywith respect to x.We're assuming that y does change with respect to x. yis not some type of a constant that we'rewriting just an abstract terms.So we're taking the derivative of this whole thingwith respect to y.Once again, just the chain rule.And then we're taking the derivative of ywith respect to x.It might be a little bit clearer if you kind of thoughtof it as the derivative with respect to x of y,as a function of x.This might be, or y is a function of x squared,which is essentially another way of writing what we have here.This might be a little bit clearerin terms of the chain rule.The derivative of y is a functionof x squared with respect to y of x.So the derivative of something squared with respectto that something, times the derivative of that something,with respect to x.This is just the chain rule.I want to say it over and over again.This is just the chain rule.So let's do that.What do we get on the right hand side over here?And I'll write it over here as well.This would be equal to the derivative of y squaredwith respect to y, is just going to be 2 times y.2 times y, just an application of the chain rule.And the derivative of y with respect to x?Well, we don't know what that is.So we're just going to leave that as times the derivativeof y with respect to x.So let's just write this down over here.So we have is 2x plus the derivative of somethingsquared, with respect to that something, is 2 timesthe something.In this case, the something is y, so 2 times y.And then times the derivative of y with respect to x.And this is all going to be equal to 0.Now that was interesting.Now we have an equation that has the derivativeof a y with respect to x in it.And this is what we essentially want to solve for.This is the slope of the tangent line at any point.So all we have to do at this point is solvefor the derivative of y with respect to x.Solve this equation.So let's do that.And actually just so we can do this whole thingon the same page so we can see where we started, let me copyand paste this up here.This is where we left off.And let's continue there.So let's say let's subtract 2x from both sides.So we're left with 2y times the derivative of y,with respect to x, is equal to-- we're subtracting 2xfrom both sides-- so it's equal to negative 2x.And if we really want to solve for the derivative of ywith respect to x, we can just divide both sides by 2y.And we're left with the derivative of ywith respect to x.Let's scroll down a little bit.The derivative of y with respect to xis equal to, well the 2s cancel out.We we're left with negative x over y.So this is interesting.We didn't have to us explicitly define yas a function of x here.But we got our derivative in terms of an x and a y.Not just only in terms of an x.But what does this mean?Well, if we wanted to find, let'ssay we wanted to find the derivative at this pointright over here.Which, if you're familiar with the unit circle,so if this was a 45 degree angle,this would be the square root of 2 over 2 commathe square root of 2 over 2.What is the slope of the tangent line there?Well, we figured it out.It's going to be negative x over y.So the slope of the tangent line hereis going to be equal to negative x.So negative square root of 2 over 2 over y.Over square root of 2 over 2, which is equal to negative 1.And that looks just about right.

I want to show you in this videois that implicit differentiation will give youthe same result as, I guess we can say,explicit differentiation when youcan differentiate explicitly.So let's say that I have the relationshipx times the square root of y is equal to 1.This one is actually pretty straightforwardto define explicitly in terms of x, to solve for y.So if we divide both sides by x, we get square root of yis equal to 1/x.And then if you square both sides, you get y is equal to 1over x squared, which is the same thing as xto the negative 2 power.And so if you want the derivative of ywith respect to x, this is pretty straightforward.This is just an application of the chain rule.So we get dy dx is equal to negative 2 xto the negative 2 minus 1-- x to the negative 3 power.So that's pretty straightforward.But what I want to see is if we get the same exact resultwhen we differentiate implicitly.So let's apply our derivative operatorto both sides of this equation.And so let me make it clear what we'redoing-- x times the square root of y and 1 right over there.When you apply the derivative operatorto the expression on the left-hand side,well, actually, we're going to apply both the productrule and the chain rule.The product rule tells us-- so wehave the product of two functions of x.You could view it that way.So this, the product rule tells us thisis going to be the derivative with respectto x of x times the square root of y plus x,not taking its derivative, times the derivativewith respect to x of the square root of y.Let me make it clear, this bracket.And on the right-hand side, right over here,the derivative with respect to x of this constant,that's just going to be equal to 0.So what does this simplify to?Well, the derivative with respect to x of x is just 1.This simplifies to 1, so we're justgoing to be left with the square root of y right over here.So this is going to simplify to a square root of y.And what does this over here simplify to?Well the derivative with respect to x of the square root of y,here we want to apply the chain rule.So let me make it clear.So we have plus this x plus whatever business this is.And I'm going to do this in blue.Well, it's going to be the derivative of the square rootof something with respect to that something.Well, the derivative of the square rootof something with respect to that something,or the derivative of something to the 1/2with respect to that something, is going to be 1/2 timesthat something to the negative 1/2 power.Once again, this right over here is the derivativeof the square root of y with respect to y.We've seen this multiple times.If I were to say the derivative of the square root of xwith respect to x, you would get 1/2 x to the negative 1/2.Now I'm just doing it with y's.But we're not done yet.Remember, our derivative operatorwasn't to say with respect to y.It's with respect to x.So this only gets us with respect to y.We need to apply the entire chain rule.We have to multiply that times the derivative of ywith respect to x in order to get the real derivativeof this expression with respect to x.So let's multiply times the derivativeof y with respect to x.We don't know what that is.That's actually what we're trying to solve for.But to use the chain rule, we justhave say it's the derivative of the square root of ywith respect to y times the derivative of ywith respect to x.This is the derivative of this thing with respect to x.So we get this on the left-hand side.On the right-hand side, we just have a 0.And now, once again, we can attemptto solve for the derivative of y with respect to x.And maybe the easiest first step isto subtract the square root of y from both sidesof this equation.And actually, let me move all of this stuff over,so I have, once again, more room to work with.So let me cut it, actually.And then let me paste it.Let me move it over, right over here.So we went from there to there.I didn't gain a lot of real estate,but hopefully this helps a little bit.And actually, I don't even like that.Let me leave it where it was before.So then, if we subtract the square root of yfrom both sides-- and I'll try to simplifyas I go-- we get this thing, which I can rewrite as xtimes-- well, it's just going to be x in the numerator dividedby 2 times the square root of y. y to the negative 1/2is just the square root of y in the denominator.And 1/2, I just put the 2 in the denominatorthere-- times dy dx times the derivative of ywith respect to x is going to be equalto the negative square root of y.I just subtracted the square root of y from both sides.And actually, this is something that I might actuallywant to copy and paste up here.So copy and then paste.So let's go back up here, just to continue our simplificationsolving for dy dx.Well, to solve for dy dx, we justhave to divide both sides by x over 2 times the square rootof y.So we're left with dy dx-- or dividing both sidesby this is the same thing as multiplyingby the reciprocal of this-- is equal to 2times the square root of y over x-- over my yellow x--times the negative square root of y.Well, what's this going to simplify to?This is going to be equal to y times--the square root of y times the square root of y is just y.The negative times the 2, you get negative 2.So you get negative 2y over x is equal to the derivative of ywith respect to x.Now you might be saying, look, we justfigured out the derivative implicitly,and it looks very different than what we did right over here.When we just used the power rule, we got negative 2 xto the negative third power.The key here is to realize that this thing right over herewe could solve explicitly in terms of-- wecould solve for y.So we could just make this substitutionback here to see that these are the exact same thing.So if we make the substitution y is equal to 1 over x squared,you would get dy dx, the derivative of y with respectto x, is equal to our negative 2 times 1 over x squared,and then all of that over x, which is equal to negative 2over x to the third, which is exactly what we have over here,negative 2 x to the negative third power.

So maybe we'lldo that right over here.So let me make it clear.This is the equivalent of saying d over dx.I'll just use this big capital D operatorso that you are familiar with the notation.And instead of using dy dx for the derivative of ywith respect to x, I'm just going to write that as y prime.So we get a little bit of practicewith different notation.So let's take the derivative of this thing right over here.Well we're going to apply the chain rule.Actually, we're going to apply the chain rulemultiple times here.The derivative of e to the something with respectto that something is going to be eto the something times the derivativeof that something with respect to x.So times the derivative of xy squared.So that's our left-hand side.We aren't done taking the derivative yet.And on our right-hand side, the derivative of x is just 1.And the derivative with respect to x of yis just going to be minus-- or I could write-- negative dy dx.But instead of writing dy dx, I'm going to write y prime.As you can tell, I like this notation and this notationmore because it makes it explicitthat I'm taking the derivative with respect to x.Here, we just have to assume that we'retaking the derivative with respect to x.Here, we have to assume that's the derivative of ywith respect to x.But anyway let's stick with this notation right over here.Actually, let me make all of my y primes,all my derivatives of y with respect to x,let me make them pink so I keep track of them.So once again, this is going to beequal to e to the xy squared times the derivative of this.Well the derivative of this, we can justuse the product and actually a little bit of the chain rulehere.So the derivative of x is just 1 times the second function.So it's going to be times y squared.And then to that, we're going to addthe product of the first function whichis this x times the derivative of y squared with respect to x.Well that's going to be the derivative of y squaredwith respect to y, which is just going to be 2ytimes the derivative of y with respectto x, which we are now writing as y prime.And then that's going to be equal to 1 minus y prime.And like we've been doing, we nowhave to just solve for y prime.So let's distribute this exponential, this eto the xy squared.And we get e, or maybe I should say y squared times eto the xy squared.So that's that.Plus 2xye to the xy squared.y prime, the derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to 1 minus the derivative of y with respectto x.Now let's get all of our y primes on one side.So let's add y prime to both sides.So let's add-- and just to be clear,I'm adding one y prime to both sides.So let's add a y prime to both sides.And let's subtract this business from both sides.So let's subtract y squared e to the xy squaredsubtracting from both sides.So we're going to subtract y squared e to the xy squared.And we are left with 2xye to the xysquared plus 1 times y prime.We had this many y primes and thenwe add another 1y prime so we have this many plus 1 y primes.That's going to be equal to-- well, I purposelyadded y prime to both sides and so we are left with 1minus-- this is kind of a crazy expression-- y squared times eto the xy squared.And now we just have to divide both sides by this.And we're left with the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to this, which I will just copy and paste.Actually, let me just rewrite it.Scroll down a little bit.It's equal to 1 minus y squared eto the xy squared over this business.Let me get some more space.2xye to the xy squared plus 1.And we're done.It was kind of crazy, but fundamentally no differentthan what we've been doing in the last few examples.

I think I lost that color,I'll do it in magenta ... is equal tonegative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared,so this is a neat thing.This right over here is a neat thing to know.And of course, we should compare it to the inverse,the derivative of the inverse sine.Actually, let me put them side by side,and we see that the only difference hereis the sign, so let me copy and paste that.I'll copy and paste it,I'm going to paste it down here,and now let's look at them side by side.So, we see for taking the derivativewith respect to x of the inverse cosinefunction, we have a negative.A negative 1 over the square root of1 minus x squared.If we're looking at the derivative withrespect to x of the inverse sine,it's the same expression except now it is positive.

already know that the derivative with respect to x oftangent of x is equal to the secant of x squared, which isof course the same thing of one over cosine of x squared.Now what we wanna do in this video, like we've done in the lastfew videos, is figure out what the derivative of the inverse function of thetangent of x is, or in particular, let's see if we can figure outwhat the derivative with respect to x of the inverse tangent of x is.And I encourage you to pause this video anduse a technique similar to the one, or veryclose to the one that we've used in thelast two videos, to figure out what this is.Well let's set y equal to the inverse tangentof x, y is equal to inverse tangent of x.That is the same thing as saying that the tangentof y, the tangent of y is equal to x.All I've done, now you can kind of think of itas I've just taken the tangent of both sides right overhere, and now we can take the derivative of both sideswith respect, the derivative of both sides with respect to x.And on the left hand side, we can just apply the chain rule.Derivative of tangent of y with respect to y, is going to be secantsquared of y, which is the same thing as one over cosine of y squared.I like to write it this way.It's it'll, keeps it a little bit simpler atleast in, in my brain, but when we're applyingthe [INAUDIBLE], it's gonna be the derivative of tangentof y with respect to y times the derivative ofy with respect to x, times the derivative of y with respect to x, and on the righthand side, the derivative of x with respect tox, well that's just going to be equal to one.And so we get, if we wanna solve for the derivative y withrespect to x, we just multiply both sides times the cosine of y squared.And we get the derivative of y with respectto x is equal to cosine of y squared.And like we've seen in previous videos,this isn't that satisfying because, you know, I'vewritten the derivative of y with respect to x as a, as a function of y.But what we're really interested in is writing it as a function of x,and to do that, we'd express this somehow in terms of the tangent of y.And the reason why the tangent of y is interesting isbecause we already know that tangent of y is equal to x.So we can rewrite this using a little bit of trigonometric identities.Then we can, with tangent of y, we cansubstitute all the tangent of y's with an x.So let's see if we can do that.And this seems a little bit tricky.They introduce a tangent of y, we'd wanna have a sine, divided by acosine, that's what tangent is, and this is just a straight up cosine squared y.So this is really gonna take a little bit more experimentation than atleast some of the other, the, than the last two examples we've done.So one thing we could do is we could say hey, let's just divide by one.Dividing by one never hurt anyone.So we could say this is the same thing,this is the same thing as cosine squared y.And I'm really doing this to, to see if Ican in, start to express it as some type of arational, a rational expression which might involve, at some point,a sine divided by cosine and it could have a tangent.So, let's divide by one.But we know from the Pythagorean, the Pythagorean identity that oneis equal to sine squared of y plus cosine squared of y, and so let'stry that or we could write cosine squared of y plus sine squared of y.Once again, why was I able to divide by this expression?Well, this expression by the Pythagorean identity, whichreally comes out of the unit circle definition oftrig functions, this is equal to one, soI have not changed the value of this expression.Now what makes this interesting is if Iwanted to introduce a sine divided by a cosine,I could just divide the numerator and thedenominator by cosine square, so lets do that, letsmultiply one over cosine or else divide thenumerator by cosine square of y and divide thedenominator, by cosine square of y, or multiply eachof them by one over cosine square of y.What's that going to give us?Well the numerator, these characters are going tocancel you're just going to have a one.And the denominator this time this this, that's going to be equal to one.And then you're gonna have sine squared, sine squared y over,over cosine squared y, and this is, this is the goal that I wastrying to achieve, I have a sine divided by cosine squared.So this right over here, this is the same thing, actually let mejust write it this way, let me, let me write it this way.This is the same thing as sine of y over cosine of y, cosine of y.Whole thing squared, which is of course the same thingas one over one plus tangent of y, tangent of y squared.This is equal to this.Now why is that useful?Well we know that x is equal to tangent of y.So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equalto one, one over, one plus tangent of y is equal to x,x squared, x squared, which is pretty exciting.We just figured out the derivative of y with respect to x.So the derivative of this thing with respectto x is one over one plus x squared.So we could write that right up here.So this is going to be equal to one overone plus x squared, and we are done.

[Instructor] What we're gonna doin this video is look at the work of other peopleas they try to take derivativesand see if their reasoning is correctand if it's not correct,try to identify what they should have doneor where their reasoning went wrong.So over here it says Nate tried to findthe derivative of X squared plus five Xtimes sine of X.Here is his work.Is Nate's work correct?If not, what's his mistake?So pause the video and see if you can answer this.Is Nate's work correct,and if not, what's his mistake?All right so I'm assuming you've had a go at it.So let's work though this step by step.So over here he's just trying to applythe derivative operator to the expression.Which is exactly what he needed to do.He's trying to find the derivative of this thing,and he says okay this is a product of two expressions,and then he says okay, well this is gonna bethe same thing as the derivativeor this is the same thing as the product of the derivatives.Now this is a problem.You are probably familiar,if I take the derivative of the sum of two things.So the derivative with respect to X of F of Xplus G of X,that indeed is equal to the derivative of the firstF prime of X plus the derivative of the second,but that is not true if we are dealing with the productof functions.The derivative with respect to X of F of X, G of Xis not necessarily,maybe there's some very special circumstance,but in general it's not going to bejust the product of the derivative.It's not going to be just F prime of X, G prime of X.Here we would want to apply the product rule.This is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to the derivativeof the first function times the second function,plus the derivative, or let me write it this way.Plus the first function, not taking its derivative,times the derivative of the second function.So he should have applied the product rule here,and so let's do thatjust to see what his answer should have been.So what he should have done here,I'll get my correcting red pen out here.Say no that's not what he should have done.He says let's take the derivative of this first thing.So actually let me color code it.So the derivative of this is two X plus five.So it should have been two X plus fivetimes the second thing.So times sine of X.Times, we do it in another color.Time the sine of X,and then to that he would add the first thing,which is X squared plus five Xtimes the derivative of the second thing.So the derivative of sine of X is cosine of X.So this is what we should have been seeingat this step right over here.He shouldn't have just taken the productof the derivatives.He should have applied the product rule.So his work is not correct,and his mistake is that he didn't apply the product rule.He just assumed that the derivative of the productsis the same thing as the product of the derivatives.Let's do more examples.Okay so let's see.It says Katy tried to find the derivativeof two X squared minus four.All of that to the third power.Here's her work.Is Katy's work correct?If not, what is her mistake?So once again, pause the video.See if you can figure it out.All right now let's inspect Katy's work.So she's taking the derivative of this and let's see,over here it looks like she's takingthe derivative of the entire expressionwith respect to the inner expressionand that is close to applying the chain rule properlybut it's not applying the chain rule properly.So her work is not correct,and her mistake is she's not correctlyapplying the chain rule.Just as a review, the chain rule says look,if we're trying tot ake the derivative with respect to Xof F of G of X,F of G of X,that this is going to be equal to,this is going to be equal to the derivativeof the whole thing with respect to G of X.So I could write that as F prime of G of X.F prime of G of X times the derivative of the inner functionwith respect to X.Times G prime of X.So over here,we could view our F function as a thingthat takes its input and takes it to the third power,and so this right over here is F prime of G of X.So this thing is the F prime of G of Xbut she forgot to multiply it by the derivativeof the inner function with respect to X.So she forgot to multiply this times the derivativeof two X squared minus four with respect to X.Which is gonna be, let's see,the derivative of two X squared,power rule two times two is four,so it's gonna be four X to the first,and then the derivative of negative four is just a zero.So it's just gonna be times four X.So that's what she needed to do in order for itto be correct.So she had to have this times four X here.Times four X.So not correct.She didn't correctly apply the chain rule.So let's do another one of these.So here,it says Njoman tried to find the derivative of sineof seven X squared plus four X.Here's his work.Is Njoman's work correct?If not, what is his mistake?Pause the video, see if you can figure it out.All right, so it's a derivative of sine of this expression.So you'd wanna use the chain rule.In fact, using the chain rule you wanna findthe derivative of the outside functionwith respect to the inside.So the derivative of sine of somethingwith respect to that somethingis gonna be cosine of that something.So that's right,and then you wanna multiply thattimes the derivative of the inside with respect to X.So the derivative of seven X squared is 14 X.The derivative of four X is four.So this is actually, that step looks good.But then Njoman does something strange over here.This is the cosine of seven X squared plus four X.Then that whole thing times 14 X plus four,but they get confused where just lookingat these parentheses and this tends to happen sometimes.This is actually one of the key errorsthat the folks at the college board,AP folks told us about.Is that when dealing with these transcendental functionscosine, sine, tangent,natural log that are written like thisand people see the parenthesesand see another parentheses,their brain just says oh let me multiplythese two expressions in parentheses,but that's not right,because if we were to add parenthesesthis is what this is implying.So you can't just take the 14 X plus fourand multiply it by this,and assuming you're taking the cosine of the whole thing.So this is where Njoman makes the mistake.The work is not correct,and the mistake is trying to multiplythese two expressions and taking the cosineof the whole thing.Let's do one more of these.I find these strangely fun.All right this one is involved.Tom tried to find the derivative ofthe square root of X over X to the fourth.Here is his work.Is Tom's work correct?If not, what's his mistake?Pause the video and see if you can figure that out.So it looks like he's trying to apply the quotient rule.So applying the quotient rule, you would,in the numerator you would take the derivativeof the first expression times the second expressionand then minus the first expressiontimes the derivative of the second expressionall of that over,or I should say the derivative of the numerator expressiontimes the denominator expression,minus the numerator expression times the derivativeof the denominator expression,all of that over the denominator expression squared.So this looks correct actually.It's a correct application of the the quotient rule.It looks like Tom is correctly simplifying.So the derivative of X to the one halfis one half X to the negative one half.So that looks right.Derivative of X to the fourth is four X to the third.So that looks right.All of this looks algebraically right,and let's see, when you simplify this.So let's see, X to the negative one halftimes X to the fourth is indeed X to,well that's going to be X to the.Oh this correlates.So this simplifies to that.Which looks correct, and that simplifies to that.Which looks correct.We're just using exponent properties there,and then divide everything by,let's see, oh there, everything is terms of X to 3.5.So we're going to have negative 3.5 X to 3.5,and then you use exploder problems.So actually it looks like he did everything correctly.This is the right answer.So his work is correct.He did not make any mistakes.But I do have a bone to pick.So speak with Tom,because he didn't have to apply the quotient rule here.He did all of this hairy calculusand algebra but it could have beena very simple simplificationhe could have made up here,and this is a key thing to realize.He could have said hey,you know what, this is the same thing.It's the derivative with respect to X ofX to the one half.That's what the square root of X is.Times X to the negative four power.That's what one over X to the fourth is.And so let me color code it.So that is the same thing as that,and that is the same thing as that,and you wouldn't even have to use the product rule here.You could simplify this even further.This is the same thingas the derivative with respect to Xof just, we have the same base.We can add the (mumbles) products.It's gonna be X to the negative 3., X to the negative 3.5,and so you can just use the power rule.So this is going to be equal to,bring the negative 3.5 out front.Negative 3.5 X to the,and then we just decrement this one by one.We subtract one from that.Negative 4.5 power.So as you can see.He could have gotten this answermuch much much much much much quicker,but he didn't make any mistakes.There's a little bit of a judgment errorjust immediately going forth with the quotient rulewhich gets quite hairy quite fast.

[Instructor] What I have listed here is severalof the derivative rules that we've used in previous videos.If these things look unfamiliar to you I encourage youto maybe to not watch this video because in this videowe're going to think about when do we apply these rules?What strategies and can we algebraically convertexpressions so that we can use a simpler rule?But this is a quick review, this is of course the powerrule right over here, very handy for taking derivativesof X raised to some power.It's also we can use that with the derivative propertiesof sums of derivatives or differences of derivativesto take derivatives of polynomials.This right over here is the product rule.If I have an expression that I want to take the derivativeof and I can think of it as the product of two functions,well then the derivative is going to be the derivativeof the first function times the second function plusthe first function times the derivative of the second.Once again if this looks completely unfamiliar to youor you're a little shaky, go watch the videos,do the practice on the power rule and the product rule,or in this case the quotient rule.And the quotient rule is a little bit more involvedand we have practicing videos on that and I always havemixed feelings about it because if you don't rememberthe quotient rule, you can usually or you can always converta quotient into a product by expressing this thingat the bottom as F of X times G of X to the negative one.So you could take the derivative with a combinationof the products and this fourth rule over here,the chain rule.And if any of this is looking unfamiliar again don't watchthis video, this video is for folks who are familiarwith each of these derivative rules or derivativetechniques and now want to think about well what arestrategies for deciding when to apply which.So let's do that.Let's say that I have the expression, let's say I'minterested in taking the derivative of X squared plus Xminus two over X minus one.Which of these rules or techniques would you use?Well you might immediately say hey look this looks likea rational expression, I could say this is my F of Xright over here, I could say this is my G of X rightover here and I could apply the quotient rule,this looks like a quotient of two expressions.And you could do that and if you do all the mathematicscorrectly, you will get the correct answer.But in this case it's good to just take a little timeto realize well can I simplify this algebraically somaybe I can do a little bit less work?And if you look at it that way, you might realizewait what if I factored this numerator I can factor itas X plus two times X minus one.And then I could cancel these two characters out and I cansay hey you know what this is going to be the same thingas the derivative with respect to X of X plus two.Derivative with respect to X of X plus two, which is muchmuch much much more straightforward than trying to applythe quotient rule.Here you would just take the derivative with respectto X of X which is just going to be one and the derivativewith respect to X of two is just going to be zeroand so all of this is going to simplify to one.If we're taking the derivative of that, you're essentiallyjust using the power rule.And so once again just a simple algebraic recognitionthings become much more simple.Let's do another example.So let's say that you were to see, or someone were to askyou to take the derivative with respect to X of,let me see, so let's say you had X squared plus two Xminus five over X.So once again you might be tempted to use the quotientrule, this looks like the quotient of two expressions.But then you might realize there's some algebraicmanipulations I could do to make this simpler.You could express this as a product, you could say thatthis is the same thing as, and I'm just going to focus onwhat's inside the parentheses or inside the brackets,this is the same thing as X to the negative one times Xsquared plus 2x minus five and then you might want toapply the product rule.But there's even a better simplification here.You could just divide each of these terms by X or one wayto think about it distribute this one over X acrossall the terms, X to the negative one is the same thingas one over X and if you do that X squared divided by Xis going to be X.2x divided by X is going to be two and then negative fivedivided by X, well you could write that as negative fiveover X or negative five X to the negative one.And now I'm taking the derivative of this with respectto X is much easier than using either the quotientor the power rule.This is going to be, let's see the derivative of thatis going to be one, derivative of two is going to be zeroand here even though you have a negative exponent,it might look a little intimidating, this is just takenusing the power rule.So negative one times negative five is positive fiveX to the, if we take one less than negative one we'regoing to go the negative two power.So once again making this algebraic recognition simplifiedthings a good bit.Let's do a few more examples of just starting to recognizewhen we might be able to simplify things to do thingsa little bit easier.So let's say that someone said hey you take the derivativewith respect to X and I'm using X as our variable that we'retaking the derivative of with respect to but obviouslythis works for any variables that we are using.So let's say we're saying square root of X over X squared.Pause this video and think about how would you approachthis if you want to take the derivative with respect to Xof the square root of X over X squared.Well once again you might say this is a quotient of twoexpressions, might try to apply the quotient rule,or you might recognize well look this is the same thing,let me just focus on what's inside the brackets, you couldview this as X to the negative two times the square rootof X and then you might want to use the product rulebut you could simplify this even better.You could say this is the same thing as X to the negativetwo times X to the one half power and now just using ourexponent properties, negative two plus one half is negativethree halves, so this is the derivative X to the negativethree halves power.And so here once again we took something that we thoughtwe might have to use the quotient rule or use the productrule and now this just becomes a straightforward usingthe power rule.So this is just going to be equal to, so bring the negativethree halves out front, negative three halves,X to the negative three halves minus one is negative fivehalves power.So once again just before you, especially if you're aboutto apply the quotient rule and sometimes even the productrule, just see is there an algebraic simplification,sometimes a trigonometric simplification that you can makethat eases your job that makes things less hairy?As a general tip I can't say this is going to be alwaystrue but if you're taking some type of exam and you're goingdown some really hairy route which the quotient rulewill often take you, it's a good sign that hey take a pausebefore trying to run through all of that algebrato apply the quotient rule and see if you cansimplify things.So let's give another example.In this one there's not an obvious way and it reallydepends on what folks' preferences are, but let's say youwant to take the derivative with respect to X of oneover 2x to the negative five, sorry, one over 2x minus fiveI should say.Well here you could immediately apply the quotient rule herethe numerator you view that as F of X.You could view this as the same thing as the derivativewith respect to X.Instead of 2x minus five, let me do that in the blue color.2x minus five to the negative one power.In this situation, you would use a combination of the powerrule and the chain rule.You would say okay my G of X is 2x minus five and F of Gof X is going to be this whole expression.And so if you applied the chain rule, this is going to bethe derivative of the outside function, our F of Xwith respect to the inside function.The derivative of F of G of X with respect to G of X.So it's going to be negative, we'll bring that negativeout front, so we're essentially just going to usethe power rule here.Negative 2x minus five to the negative two and then wemultiply that times the derivative of the inside function.So the inside function's derivative, the derivativeof 2x is two, the derivative of negative five is zeroso it's going to be times two and of course you can simplifyso it's a negative two times all of this business.Let me do one more example here just to hit the point homeand once again there isn't a must way, there isn't a waythat you have to do this, but just let you appreciatethat there's multiple ways to approach these typesof derivatives.So let's say someone said take the derivative of 2xplus one squared.Pause the video and think about how you would do that.Well one way to do it is just to apply the chain rulejust like we just did.So you could say alright here's going to be the derivativeof the outside with respect to the inside.So it's going to be two times 2x plus one to the firstpower, taking one less than that times the derivativeof the inside which is just going to be two and so thisis going to be equal to four times 2x plus one,which is equal to, if we want to distribute the four,we could say it's 8x plus four.That's a completely legitimate way of doing it.Now there are other ways of doing it.You could expand out to X plus one squared.You could say hey this is the same thing as the derivativewith respect to X of 2x squared is going to be 4x squaredand then two times the product of these terms is goingto be plus 4x plus one.And now you would just apply the power rule.It's a little bit of extra algebra up front but you canjust go straightforward with the power rule and you'regoing to get this exact same thing.So the whole takeaway here is pause look at your expression.See if there's a way to simplify it and it's especiallya good thing if you can get out of using the quotient rule'cause that sometimes is just hard to know or rememberand even when you do remember it, it can get quite hairyquite fast.

[Instructor] So I have two different expressions herethat I wanna take the derivative of.And what I want you to do is pause the videoand think about how you would first approachtaking the derivative of this expressionand how that might be the same or differentas your approach in taking the derivativeof this expression.The goal here isn't to compute the derivatives all the way,but really to just think about how we identifywhat strategies to use.Okay so let's first tackle this one.And the key when looking at a complex expressionlike either of these is to look at the big picturestructure of the expression.So one way to think about it is,let's look at the outside rather than the inside details.So if we look at the outside here,we have the sineof something.So there's a sine of something going on herethat I'm going to circle in redor in this pink color.So that's how my brain thinks about it.From the outside I'm like okay,big picture I'm taking the sineof some stuff.I might be taking some stuff to some exponent.In this case, I'm inputting in a trigonometric expression.But if you have a situation like that,it's a good sign thatthe chain rule is in order.So let me write that down.So we would wanna use in this casethe chain rule, C.R. for chain rule.And how would we apply it?Well we would take the derivative of the outsidewith respect to this insidetimes the derivative of this insidewith respect to x.And I'm gonna write it the way that my brainsometimes thinks about it.So we can write this asthe derivativewith respect tothat something,and I'm just gonna make that pink circlefor the something rather than writing it all again,of sine of that something,sine of that something,not even thinking about what that something is just yet,times, times the derivativewith respect to xof that something.This is just an applicationof the chain rule.No matter what was here in thispink colored circle,it might have been something with square rootsand logarithms and whatever else,as long as it's being contained within the sine,I would move to this step.The derivative with respect to that somethingof sine of that somethingtimes the derivative with respect to x of the something.Now what would that be tangibly in this case?Well this first part,I will do it in orange,this first part would just be cosineof x squared plus fivetimes cosine of x.So that's that circle right over there.Let me close the cosine right over there.And then times the derivative with respect to x,times the derivative with respect to x,of all of this again,of x squared plus fivetimes cosine of x.And then I would close my brackets.And of course I wouldn't be done yet,I have more derivative taking to do.Here now I would look at the big structureof what's going on,and I have two expressions being multiplied.I don't have just onebig expression that's being an inputinto like a sine function or cosine functionor one big expression that's taken to some exponent.I have two expressions being multiplied.I have thisbeing multiplied by this.And so if I'm just multiplying two expressions,that's a pretty good clue that to compute this part,I would then use the product rule.And I could keep doing that and compute it,and I encourage you to do so,but this is more about the strategiesand how do you recognize them.But now let's go to the other example.Well this looks a lot more like this stepof the first problem than the beginningof the original problem.Here I don't have a sine of a bunch of stuffor a bunch of stuff being raised to one exponent.Here I have the product of two expressionsjust like we saw over here.We have this expressionbeing multiplied by this expression.So my brain just says okay I have two expressions,then I'm going to use the product rule.Two expressions being multiplied,I'm going to use the product rule.If it was one expression being dividedby another expression, then I would use the quotient rule.But in this case it's going to be the product rule.And so that tells methat this is going to be the derivative with respect to xof the first expression,just gonna do that with the orange circle,times the second expression,I'm gonna do that with the blue circle,plus the first expression, not taking its derivative,the first expression, timesthe derivative with respect to x of,of the second expression.Once again here,this is just the product rule.You can substitute sine of x squared plus fivewhere you see this orange circle,and you can substitute cosine of xwhere you see this blue circle.But the whole point here isn't to actually solve thisor compute this,but really to just showhow you identify the structures in these expressionsto think about well do I use the chain rule firstand then use the product rule here?Or in this case do I use the product rule first?And even once you do this,you're not going to be done.Then to compute this derivative,you're going to have to use the chain rule,and you'll keep going until you don't have any morederivatives to take.

[Instructor] What we're going to do in this videois try to find the derivative with respect to Xof X squaredsin of X.All of that to the third power.And what's going to be interesting is that there'smultiple ways to tackle it.And I encourage you to pause the videoand see if you could work through it on your own.So there's actually multiple techniques.One path is to do the chain rule first.So I'll just say CRfor chain rule first.And so I have, I'm taking the derivative with respect to Xof something to the third power.So, if I take the derivative it would bethe derivative with respect to that something.So that would bethree times that somethingsquaredtimes the derivative with respect to Xof that something.Where the something, in this case,is X squared sin of X.X squared sinof X.This is just an application of the chain rule.Now, the second part, what would that be?The second part heredo this in another color.In orange.Well here, I would apply the product rule.I have a product of two expressions.So I would take the derivative of, let me write this down.So this is gonna be the product rule.Product rule.I would take the derivative of the first expression.So, X, derivative of X squaredis two X.Let me write a little bit to the right.This is gonna be two Xtimes the second expressionsin of X.Plus the first expression X squaredtimes the derivative of the second one.Cosin of X.That's just the product ruleas applied to this partright over here.And all of that, of course, is being multiplied bythis up front.Which actually, let me justrewrite that.So all of this I could rewrite aslet's see, this would bethree timesif I have the product raised to the second powerI could take each of them to the second powerand then take their products.So X squared squared isX to the fourth.And then sin of X squared issinsquared of X.And then all of that is being multiplied by that.And, if we want, we can algebraically simplify.We can distribute everything out.In which case, what would we get?Well let's see.Three times two is six.X to the fourth times X isX to the fifth.Sin squared of X times sin of Xis sin of Xto the third power.And then, let's see, threeso plus three, X to the fourth times X squared isX to the sixth power.And then I have sin squared of Xsin squared of Xcosin of X.So there you have it, that's one strategychain rule first, and then product rule.What would be another strategypause the video and try to think of it.Well, we could just algebraicallyuse our exponent properties first.In which case, this is going to be equal tothe derivative with respect to Xofif I'm taking X squared times sin of X to the third powerinstead I could say X to the third powerwhich is going to be X to the sixth.And then sin of X to the third power.Sin of Xto thethird power.I'm using the same exponent propertythat we used right over here to simplify this.If I have if I'm doing the product thingsto some exponent, well that's the same thingif each of them raised to the exponentand then the product of the two.Now how would we tackle this?Well, I here, I would dothe product rule first.So let's do that.So let's do the productrule.So, we're gonna takethe derivative of the first expression.So, derivative of X to the sixthis sixX to the fifth.Times the second expression.Sinto the third of X.Or, sin of X to the third power.Plus the first X to the sixthtimes the derivative of the secondand I'm just gonna write thatD DX ofsin of Xto the third power.Now, to evaluate this right over hereit does definitely make senseto use the chain rule.Usethe chain rule.And so what is this going to be?Well I have the derivative of somethingto the third power.So that's going to be threetimes that something squaredtimes the derivative of that something.So in this case, the something is sin of X.And the derivative of sin of X is cosin of X.Then I have all of this business over here.I have six X to the fifth.Sin to the thirdor sin of X to the third power.PlusX to the sixth.And if I were to just simplify this a little bitin fact, you see it very clearly.These two things are equivalent.Thisthis term is exactly equivalent to this termthe way it's written.And then this is exactly,if you multiply three times X to the sixthsin of X squaredcosin of X.So, the nice thing about mathif we're doing things that make logical sensewe should get to the same endpoint.But the point here is that there's multiple strategies.You could use a chain rule firstand then the product rule.Or you could use a product rule first,and then the chain rule.In this case, you could debate which one is faster.It looks like the one on the rightmight be a little bit faster.Butsometimesthese two are pretty close.But sometimes it'll be more clear than notwhich one is preferable.You really want to minimize the amount of hairiness,the amount the number of stepsthe chances for careless mistakes you might have.

classic implicit differentiation problemis the problem y is equal to x to the x.And then to find out what the derivative of yis with respect to x.And people look at that, oh you know, I don't have just aconstant exponent here, so I can't just use the powerrules, how do you do it.And the trick here is really just to take the natural log ofboth sides of this equation.And this is going to build up to what we're going todo later in this video.So If you take the natural log on both sides of this equation,you get the natural log of y is equal to the naturallog of x to the x.Now our power rules, or I guess our natural log rules, saylook, if I'm taking the natural log of something to thesomething, this is equivalent to, I can rewrite the naturallog of x to the x as being equal to x times thenatural log of x.So let me rewrite everything again.If I take the natural log of both sides of that equation, Iget the natural log of y is equal to x times thenatural log of x.And now we can take the derivative of both sides ofthis with respect to x.So the derivative with respect to x of that, and thenthe derivative with respect to x of that.Now we're going to apply a little bit of the chain rule.So the chain rule.What's the derivative of this with respect to x?What's the derivative of our inner expressionwith respect to x?It's a little implicit differentiation, so it's dywith respect to x times the derivative of this wholething with respect to this inner function.So the derivative of natural log of x is 1/x.So the derivative of natural log of y withrespect to y is 1/y.So times 1/y.And the derivative of this-- this is just the product rule,and I'll arbitrarily switch colors here-- is the derivativeof the first term, which is 1, times the second term, so timesthe natural log of x plus the derivative of the second term,which is 1/x times the first term.So times x.And so we get dy/dx times 1/y is equal to natural log of xplus-- this just turns out to be 1-- x divided by x, andthen you multiply both sides of this by y.You get dy/dx is equal to y times the naturallog of x plus 1.And if you don't like this y sitting here, you could justmake the substitution.y is equal to x to the x.So you could say that the derivative of y with respect tox is equal to x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.And that's a fun problem, and this is often kind of given asa trick problem, or sometimes even a bonus problem if peopledon't know to take the natural log of both sides of that.But I was given an even more difficult problem, andthat's what we're going to tackle in this.But it's good to see this problem done first because itgives us the basic tools.So the more difficult problem we're going todeal with is this one.Let me write it down.So the problem is y is equal to x to the-- and here's thetwist-- x to the x to the x.And we want to find out dy/dx.We want to find out the derivative of ywith respect to x.So to solve this problem we essentially use the same tools.We use the natural log to essentially breakdown thisexponent and get it into terms that we can deal with.So we can use the product rule.So let's take the natural log of both sides of this equationlike we did last time.You get the natural log of y is equal to the natural logof x to the x to the x.And this is just the exponent on this.So we can rewrite this as x to the x times the natural logtimes the natural log of x.So now our expression our equation is simplified to thenatural log of y is equal to x to the x times thenatural log of x.But we still have this nasty x to the x here.We know no easy way to take the derivative there, although I'veactually just shown you what the derivative of this is, sowe could actually just apply it right now.I was going to take the natural log again and it would turninto this big, messy, confusing thing but I realized thatearlier in this video I just solved for what thederivative of x to the x is.It's this thing right here.It's this crazy expression right here.So we just have to remember that and then apply andthen do our problem.So let's do our problem.And if we hadn't solved this ahead of time, it was kind ofan unexpected benefit of doing the simpler version of theproblem, you could just keep taking the natural log of this,but it'll just get a little bit messier.But since we already know what the derivative of x to thex is, let's just apply it.So we're going to take the derivative of bothsides of the equation.Derivative of this is equal to the derivative of this.We'll ignore this for now.Derivative of this with respect to x is the derivative ofthe natural log of y with respect to y.So that's 1/y times the derivative of ywith respect to x.That's just the chain rule.We learned that in implicit differentiation.And so this is equal to the derivative of the first termtimes the second term, and I'm going to write it out here justbecause I don't want to skip steps and confuse people.So this is equal to the derivative with respect to x ofx to the x times the natural log of x plus the derivativewith respect to x of the natural log ofx times x to the x.So let's focus on the right hand side of this equation.What is the derivative of x to the x with respect to x?Well we just solved that problem right here.It's x to the x natural log of x plus 1.So this piece right there-- I already forgot what itwas-- it was x to the x natural log of x plus 1.That is x to the x times the natural log of x plus 1.And then we're going to multiply that timesthe natural log of x.And then we're going to add that to, plus the derivativeof the natural log of x.That's fairly straightforward, that's 1/x times x to the x.And of course the left hand side of the equationwas just 1/y dy/dx.And we can multiply both sides of this now by y, and we getdy/dx is equal to y times all of this crazy stuff-- x to thex times the natural log of x plus 1 times the natural log ofx plus 1/x times x to the x.That's x to the negative 1.We could rewrite this as x to the minus 1, and thenyou add the exponents.You could write this as x to the x minus 1 power.And if we don't like this y here, we can justsubstitute it back.y was equal to this, this crazy thing right there.So our final answer for this seemingly-- well on one levellooks like a very simple problem, but on another levelwhen you appreciate what it's saying, it's like oh there's avery complicated problem-- you get the derivative of y withrespect to x is equal to y, which is this.So that's x to the x to the x times all of this stuff-- timesx to the x natural log of x plus 1 times the natural logof x, and then all of that plus x to the x minus 1.So who would have thought.Sometimes math is elegant.You take the derivative of something like this andyou get something neat.For example, when you take the derivative of naturallog of x you get 1/x.That's very simple and elegant, and it's nice that mathworked out that way.But sometimes you do something, you take an operation onsomething that looks pretty simple and elegant, and you getsomething that's hairy and not that pleasant to lookat, but is a pretty interesting problem.And there you go.

[Voiceover] Let's say y is equal tothe natural log of x to the xth power,and what we wanna do, we wanna findthe derivative of y with respect to x.So I encourage you to pause this videoand see if you can do it.So, when you first try to tackle this,this is a little bit daunting.We know how to take the derivative of constantsto some x power, but how do we take a derivativeof some time of a function, in this case,a natural log, to the xth power?And the answer here is to use some ofour logarithmic properties, and then we're going to doa little bit of implicit differentiation.So the first thing that we wanna do,actually, let me rewrite this with a little bit of space,so, this was a natural log of x to the xth power.So the first thing, I wanna get rid of this xas an exponential, and I wanna be ableto apply the product rule somehow.The way we're gonna do that is by takingthe natural log of both sides.So take the natural log of both sides,and you might say, well, why is that helpful?Well, if I'm taking the natural logof something to an exponent, well, this is the same thing,actually, let me write this downas a property that you may or may not rememberfrom your logarithmic properties,so if I have, I could write log,or I'll just write natural log,of, if I have natural log of a to the b power,this is the same thing as b times the natural log of a.It's just a standard logarithmic property.And so, by taking the natural log of both sides,this exponent can now become out frontand scale the natural log function.So this exponent now, we can bring that out front,and let's just rewrite everything.So we get the natural log of yis equal to, so then let me put that in parentheses,so it's the natural log of y,is equal to x, that x is in blue,x times the natural log times the natural log, of, sorry,x times the natural log of the natural log of x.The natural log of the natural log of x.So, there you have it.By just taking the natural log of both sidesand using this logarithmic property,we were able to get that.Now you're saying, well, gee,how is this actually going to be useful for us?Well now, we can implicitly takethe derivative of both sides of this.And actually, let me scoot this overto the right a little bit, just so that we can,I have space for my derivative operator.So there you go, scooted that over.And so now, let's take the derivativewith respect to x of both sides.So let me, so I'm gonna take the derivativewith respect to x of the left-hand sideand of the right-hand side,and of the right-hand side.Now, on the left-hand side, this is going to be,essentially, an application of the chain rule.When you learn implicit differentiation,it's really just application of the chain rule.It's the derivative of the outside functionwith respect to to the inside function,so the natural log of y with respect to y,the derivative of that is just going to be one over y,one over y times the derivative ofthe inside function with respect to x.So dy dx, dy dx.That is going to be equal to,well this is going to get interesting a little bit.Actually, let me do some stuff on the side a little bit.Let me just, the first thing we wanna do hereis just apply the product rule.So it's the derivative of the first expression,so it's just going to be 1 times the second,I guess you'd say, function,so times the natural log of the natural log of x,natural log of x, and thenplus the first function, just x,times the derivative of the second function.Times the derivative of the second function.What's the derivative of the natural logof the natural log of x?Let's do that separately.So if I have, if I'm trying to take the derivative,with respect to to x, of the natural log,the natural log of the natural log of x,of the natural log of x,well, here, again, I can apply the chain rule.The derivative of that magenta functionwith respect to the inside function,that is going to be one over the natural log of x,and then times the derivative of the inside functionwith respect to x, so times one over x.So this is equal to one over x natural log of x.So the derivative of this second function right over hereis one over x natural log of x,one over x natural log of x.Let's see, that x and that x cancels out,and so we are left with, we are left with one over y,and I'll just write all of this in this blue color,so one over y times the derivative of ywith respect to x, is equal to,see this is just the natural log of the natural log of x,the natural log of the natural log of x,plus one over the natural log of x,one over the natural log of x.And now, to solve for the derivative,we can multiply both sides by y, so let's do that.So we're gonna multiply that side by y,and we're gonna multiply this side times y,and what are we going to get?Well, on the left-hand side, that's why we multiplied by y,we just have the derivative y with respect to x,derivative of y with respect to x,is equal to, well, y is our original,is all this, is our original thing that we had.Y was equal to the natural log,let me rewrite it over here.Y was equal to the natural log of x to the xth power.So this is, we're essentially multiplying both sidestimes the natural log of x to the xth power.So this gonna get a little bit, a little bit messy here.So we could just write it the way I wrote it just now,without it being distributed,actually, let me just leave it like that.So it's going to be, and so we deservea drum roll right now, 'cause this is quite involved,the natural log of the natural log of xplus one over the natural log of x,all of that times the natural log of x to the xth power.So that was quite involved.And if someone said well, what is the derivative of ywhen x is equal to e?So if someone says what is this equal towhen x is equal to e, well, we could evaluate thiswhen x is equal to e.This would be the, and I just made that up just now,so if like the original question wasn't justwhat is dy dx, if they saidwhat is dy dx when x is equal to e.If that was the original question,then we could evaluate it.So where we just replace all these with e's,so it'd be an e there, an e there, an e there,and an e there, and I just picked the value e'cause it's easy to evaluate.So that natural log of e is 1,natural log of 1 e to the zeroth power is 1,so all of that just becomes 0.The natural log of e is 1,so this whole expression right over herebecomes zero plus one over one,so this becomes one, and thenthe natural log of e is, the natural log of e is one,and you're gonna have one to the eth power,well you could raise one to any power,and you're just get one.So it's one times one is equal to one.So I just thought it would be funto try to evaluate that at a valuethat would be somewhat clean.

The result that I hope to show you,or you give you an intuition for, in this videois something that we will usein the proof of the chain rule,or in a proof of the chain rule actually.We may do more than proof of the chain rule.But the result we're gonna look atis if we have some function uwhich is a function of x,and we know that it is continuousat x equals c,so if we know this, then that's going to implythat the change in u goesto zero as our change in x in this regionaround c goes to zero.This is what I want to get an intuition for.That if u is continuous at c,then as our change in x around cgets smaller, and smaller, and smalleras it approaches zero, then our change in uapproaches zero as well.To think about this, or to even kind of prove itto ourselves a little bit more rigorously,let's think about what it meansto be continuous at x equals c.Well the definition of continuity is,so this literally is the same thing as sayingthat the limit as x approaches cof u of x is equal to u of c.The limit that our function approachesas x approaches c is equalto the value of the function at c.We don't have a point discontinuityor a jump discontinuity.If we had a jump discontinuity,then the limit wouldn't exist,and we've seen that in previous videos.Now I'm just gonna manipulate this algebraicallyso it essentially gives us this conclusionright over here.So this we can rewrite.It's important to realize that u of c,this is just going to be some value.It looks like maybe this is a functionof x or something, but no,this is just going to be some value.I've inputted c here and I've evaluatedthe function of that, and so this is goingto be some number.It could be five, or seven, or pi,or negative one, but it's just goingto be some value, some constant.So I can treat it like a constant.So this is going to be the same thingas saying the limit as xapproaches c of u of xminus u of cis equal to zero.And actually, in the video where we provethat differentiability implies continuity,we started with this and we provedthat right over there.We show that these two are equivalent things.But hopefully you could even thinkabout the intuition.This is just if the limit of u of xis x approaches c is equal to this,then when you evaluate this limit,the limit is x approaches c,well this thing is going to approach u of c,because we saw it right up here,u of c minus u of c is indeedgoing to be equal to zero.So hopefully you don't feel like it's too muchof a stretch, and you can just subtractu of c from both sides and apply propertiesof limits, and you can get this result as well.But this is interesting because this essentiallycan take us to this,the idea that as our change in xgets smaller, and smaller, and smalleras it approaches zero, then our changein our function is also going to approach zero.Now let's just graph this or visualize thisto get a sense of that.So this is our x axis.Woops.That's our x axis.Let's call that our u axis maybe.And I did u intentionally becausethat's the variable we'll usein our proof of the chain rule video.Let's say this right over hereis our function.Let's say this right over here,that is c.This right over here is u of c.U of c.Then let's just take some arbitrary x over here.So some arbitrary x,and then this right over here is u of x.So if we define our change,let me do this.If we define our change in u is equalto u of x minus u of c,which makes sense because thisis our change in u.So let's say this is going to be u of xminus u of c.If we define our change in xis equal to x minus c,which it is in this case,it is x minus c,then we can rewrite this limitright over here.Instead of saying the limit as x approaches c,we could write the limit as delta xapproaches zero, because if x approaches c,then delta x is going to approach zero.So we could write this the limitas delta x approaches zero of delta uis going to be equal to zero.We define this as our change in u,and it is our change in u.So this is equal to zero.So another way of thinking about thisis as delta x approaches zero,our change in u, our change in the function,is going to approach zero.So as delta x approaches zero,delta u approaches zero.That's what we wrote over here.Delta u approaches zeroas delta x approaches zero.In a lot of ways, this is hopefully common sense.We're dealing with a continuous function.As you get smaller and smaller,and you can just think of it this way,as you get smaller and smaller changes in x's,as our change in x gets smaller,and smaller, and smaller, and smaller,well it's because it's continuous.You wouldn't be able to say thisfor a discontinuous function,but because it's continuous,or you wouldn't be able to say thisfor some discontinuous functions,as our change in x gets smaller,and smaller, and smaller,then our change in u is going to get smaller,and smaller, and smaller.So it makes intuitive sense,but hopefully this makes you feeleven better about it because we're going to usethis idea to prove the chain rulein the next video.
